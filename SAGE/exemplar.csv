Under the Speaker's announced policy ofJanuary 3, 2017, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.Russell) for 30 minutes.Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, Dr. Kevin Portteus, professor at HillsdaleCollege, made an interesting observation in his excellent study,``Immigration and the American Founding'':America's immigration problem is not with immigrants, butwith Americans. In order for the Founders' policies to beintelligible and effective, America must return to theFounders' principles of justice. If America is not based onthose principles, then it is like the other nations, and theidea of America as an asylum becomes muddled and incoherent.If we accept feudal obligation and its modern incarnation,birthright citizenship, then the ideas of government byconsent and the right to emigrate become obscured. If weforget that consent is reciprocal and that the purpose ofgovernment is to protect the inalienable natural rights ofits citizens, then the right and duty to restrict immigrationand naturalization becomes nothing but an expression ofracism and nativism. If we forget our heritage as a refugefor the virtuous and oppressed of the world, then we lose asignificant part of what makes America exceptional.Mr. Speaker, I am not an immigration expert. I do, however, know andlove the history of our great Republic. I speak before America, not asa member of any party, but as an American who has nearly given my lifeon multiple battlefields in defense of her Constitution. As such, I amdisturbed at the abandonment of principle by both sides of the aisle,the acceptance of sound bites in lieu of facts, and the framing ofpopular, even if opposing sentiments that are used to leveragepolitical power.In our national immigration debate, we suffer much bitter contention,with political power being used to divide America on her foundations inthe hopes that one side may force the other into its will. But what ofit? What if we had no respect for the law? What if we closed the doorto the poor and wretched masses? What if we had no security on ourborders? What if we allowed privileged classes to have distinction inimmigration? Either side prevailing on such a course would end thegreat experiment of liberty and equality among mankind as embodied inthe very fabric of our Nation.And with all the critique about the use of Biblical passages tosupport various views on immigration, how about this one from Proverbs29:12 that can be leveled against both sides of our nationalgovernment:If a ruler pays attention to lies, all his servants becomewicked.Mr. Speaker, Dr. Portteus is correct that America's immigrationproblem is not with immigrants, but with Americans. We should take hiscounsel to examine how a people bound by liberty and equality, ratherthan birthright and obligation, should govern themselves andaccommodate those seeking the same.Our Founders were driven by the premise that all are created equal,endowed by the Creator with certain inalienable rights, that amongthese are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In that vein,they categorically rejected the notion of obligation to government orservitude to landholders simply by the happenstance of one's birth.Washington framed it simply, but effectively: ``The bosom of Americais open to receive not only the opulent and respectable stranger, butthe oppressed and persecuted of all nations and religions; whom weshall welcome to a participation of all our rights and privileges, ifby decency and propriety of conduct, they appear to merit theenjoyment.''Thomas Jefferson conveyed it along these lines:If an individual chooses to depart from the regime of his birth andto associate with a new one, he has an inherent right to do so.Jefferson, in his first address to Congress, put it this way: ``Shallwe refuse the unhappy fugitives from distress . . . hospitality . . . ?Shall oppressed humanity find no asylum on this globe? . . . Might notthe general character and capabilities of a citizen be safelycommunicated to every one manifesting a bona fide purpose of embarkinghis life and fortunes permanently with us.''To redress the dilemma of various States creating a patchwork ofstandards for who should be allowed or not allowed as immigrants, theframers of the Constitution settled the issue by granting Congress thepower to ``establish an uniform naturalization rule.''Enjoying the fruit of such immigration policy, the French-bornimmigrant J. Hector St. John de Crevecoeur, in his ``Letters from anAmerican Farmer'' praised the political liberty and economic prosperityof America, saying: ``Europe contains hardly any other distinctions butlords and tenants; this fair country alone is settled by freeholders,the possessors of the soil they cultivate, members of the governmentthey obey, and the framers of their own laws, by means of theirrepresentatives . . . It is here that the idle may be employed, theuseless become useful, and the poor become rich.''The first Federal naturalization law passed by this Congress underthe Constitution required 2 years' residency in the United States, 1year's residency in the State he was applying for citizenship, an oathof loyalty, and as an indication of the times, rather than many of theframers' expressed wishes, that the applicant be a free white person.Subsequent statutes increased the length of time to as much as 14years, but by 1802, Congress settled on the 5-year residencyrequirement that persists to this day. No other restrictions wereimposed. No incentives or encouragements by class were instituted.Later, Congress abolished the immigration slave trade in 1808 andfurther eliminated the notion of class structure with the Passenger Actof 1819 to end indentured servitude immigration. It would take another50 years to secure the rights of all men under the law, but the steadyefforts of many were realized without any alteration of the framers'original principles. After the Civil War, the Fourteenth, Fifteenth,and Sixteenth Amendments simply and rightly applied those principles toall Americans, naturally born, freed, or naturalized.American anathema to class distinction guided her well in the firstcentury, culminating with the Civil War, as all men truly became equalunder the law along the framework of the Founders' principles. Rejectedwas an obligation to government by birth, but rather, the Americanideal was to voluntarily consent to government by choice. This ideal inits purist sense was upheld until the 1898 Supreme Court decisionUnited States v. Wong Kim Ark which somewhat returned the feudalisticcitizenship by birthright contrary to the views of many of theFounders. While doing good in securing certain rights for certainindividuals, it also set up the construct to eliminate the rights ofthose not naturally born who wished to associate as law abidingimmigrants by choice.American immigration historically has largely been driven by worldevents. Prior to the Great Depression and World War II, annualimmigration comprised .64 of 1 percent of the United States population,with spikes as high as 1.61 percent. Immigrants expanded the country,cultivated the fields, spiked the railroads, and laid the cities acrossthe Nation. By the time we entered the First World War in 1917, fullyone-third of the Nation's population had been born overseas or had aparent who was an immigrant. A full 20 percent of the doughboys we sentto France in World War I were not even born in the United States,fighting to secure our liberty and also a new place in the world inwhat became an American century.Immigration dropped sharply due to economics, fear, and war with theGreat Depression and World War II, but migrant workers still came bythe hundreds of thousands during the war. Laborers from Mexico andCentral America entered the agricultural fields and farms as we fed ourarmies and ourselves.An inseparable bond between agriculture and the guest worker resultedin demand for farm workers and industrial labor during the war. TheUnited States Government recognized this with the Bracero accord thatallowed for these workers to come annually to[[Page H5359]]meet a crisis during the war and a vibrant economic growth thereafter.Succumbing to fears about uncapped workers in our fields and farms oron our machines at home, this Congress ended the Bracero accord in1964. And with the institution of new immigration caps in 1965, analmost immediate spike in illegal immigration rose as seasonal workers,with no guarantee that they would make the next season's quota, stayedinstead. The problem became so bad, that Congress again struggled withwhat to do and by 1986, took a stab at accommodating those that someargued would have likely been citizens at normal immigration rates inexchange for strengthening our southern border. We only got theimmigrants when both were sorely needed.Now we are here today. Only .32 percent of our population areimmigrants arriving annually. That is markedly lower than when we werefighting the Civil War. While the agricultural industry and the housingand construction industries are symbiotically entwined, we insteadaddress immigration issues separate from what used to be handled underthe Bracero accord.{time}  1845And while the economic drivers are pulling immigrants to seek abetter life in our country, we, in turn, will restrict already smallpercentages of our population to even smaller ones, despite the factthat our unemployment numbers are lower than our job openings for thefirst time in American history.What could we do? Some low-hanging fruit would be to secure ourborder and to provide some type of permanent residency for minors knownas DACA recipients to address the immediate need. A bipartisan majoritycould readily vote for such a clean measure. Then, once that is done,we can establish a uniform naturalization rule to address furtherissues.Yet the solutions offered to us this week, instead, are to demonizefamily migration, accommodate only those with some station in life orthose able to pay a million bucks to get a permanent residency and,thus, end the hopes of those wishing to come here legally with analready reduced system.We have many claims floating around these august Chambers. Here aresome of them:Immigrants are taking our jobs;Immigrants are destroying our American way of life with chainmigration;We are flooded by a wave of illegal and legal immigration unlike anytime in our Nation's history.Here's the reality: The percentage of native-born workers to fuel ourconstruction and agricultural economies do not exist. We can eitherimport workers or we can import our food.In a study published in 2013, economist Michael Clemens did a 15-yearanalysis of data on North Carolina's farm labor market, concludingthere is virtually no supply of native manual farm laborers in theState. This was true even in the depths of a severe recession.In 2011, with 6,500 available farm jobs in the State, only 268 ofnearly half a million unemployed North Carolinians applied for thosejobs. More than 90 percent of them--a whopping 245 people--of thoseapplying, were hired, but just 163 even showed up for the first day'swork. Only seven native workers completed the entire growing season,filling only one-tenth of 1 percent of the open farm jobs.This is not an abnormality. Since World War II, migrant workers havefueled America as the breadbasket of the globe. That may change. As Istated, we can either import workers or we can import food.The problem with the workforce may be even deeper than we know. In2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control, there were about 60births per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44, which is 3 percent lower than therate in 2016 and the lowest recorded rate of birth since the governmentstarted tracking birth rates in 1909.Our actual birth rate is now 1.84. A nation must have at least a 2.1birth rate to sustain itself. Plus, we abort about 1.2 to 1.5 millionchildren a year. We immigrate approximately 1 million people a year,and many of those have children. If one were to subtract the 39 millionimmigrants in our population since Roe v. Wade, our actual birth ratewould even be lower. As in the past, immigrants are sustaining ournational growth in spite of ourselves, and just barely.The issue of family immigration, now demonized as chain migration,was originally conceived as a way to ensure immigrants arriving had asupport base structure, negating or reducing the need for governmentassistance. It has largely achieved that aim. Now, if current proposalsbecome law, instead of acquiring a more stable and skilled workforce,the opposite is likely to occur, as it did before family migration wasinstituted.And what of this dastardly diversity lottery? Is it the ``diversity''name that offends us?The reality is the diversity lottery visas ensure immigrants comefrom a wide spectrum of nations rather than just those south of theborder.Further, a study published just a couple of months ago showed thatdiversity lottery recipients and family migrants, far from beingunskilled and ignorant, are actually better educated than naturallyborn citizens. The study showed that 47 percent had a college degree orhigher, as compared to 29 percent of the naturally born Americanpopulation.It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, we could use more of this type ofignorance and lack of skill.Americans of all generations have had concerns about immigrants:Irish, Dutch, German, Chinese, Eastern European, Mexican, Vietnamese,Persian, Lebanese, Syrian. We fret over language, even though studiesshow second-generation Americans are fully engaged lingually, andthird-generation Americans speak virtually nothing of their old tongue.In our current national debate, immigrants south of the border carrysuch worrisome traits as strong in their faith, close-knit families,hardworking, and small business entrepreneurs. As a conservative, itsounds a lot like the things that I stand for. As an American, itsounds a lot like the America I fought for.Immigrants of all stripes have defended this country with theirlives. Forty percent of the soldiers I lost in Iraq were immigrants orhad immigrating parents. One was not even a citizen but earned hiscitizenship posthumously.While our Nation has ever been sustained by immigrants defendingtheir newfound freedom along with ours, we must reject a dangerousproposal creeping into the immigration measures on this floor, namely,that nonpermanent residents can earn a residency by military service.Now, we have long accommodated permanent residents to earn theircitizenship, but to place people with no status or allegiance intouniform makes us no better than a foreign legion or, worse, a Romanlegion.The Statue of Liberty does not wear a blindfold. That is reserved forLady Justice. Ms. Justice must continue to hold her scales in balance,with the laws of Americans on one hand balanced by those seekingcitizenship to also, themselves, be law-abiding in pursuit of a newcitizenship.Americans are not flooded by immigrants. We are well below the norm,historically. We are, however, starved by restrictive, unaccommodatingpolicy that meets neither the lamp lit by our Founders nor the economicengines needing hands to turn them.Lady Liberty must continue to raise her arm and keep her torchburning brightly rather than exchange it for a stiff arm and a middlefinger. The words inscribed at her base must not say ``Send me onlyyour physicians, your scientists, and your Nobel laureates.''If we use our passions, anger, and fear to snuff out liberty's flameby xenophobic and knee-jerk policies, the enemies of liberty win, andwhat makes America exceptional dies, period.We have so lost our way on immigration that we even have those acrossour land rejecting those fleeing tyranny. I want you to listencarefully to these statements by Members of Congress in response to arefugee bill--not illegals, not permanent residents, but refugees,people fleeing for their lives. Listen to these statements by Membersof Congress:[[Page H5360]]Fighting immigration is ``the best vote-getting argument . . . Thepolitician can beat his breast and proclaim his loyalty to America.''``He can tell the unemployed man he is out of work because some alienhas his job.''Here's another one. Congress must ``protect the youth of America fromthis foreign invasion.''And how about this one? ``American children have first claim toAmerica's charity.''There are many more, but these quotes were from 1939. The refugeebill was not for Muslim and Christian Syrians or Iraqi Muslims,Christians, and Yazidis. It was for German and Eastern European Jews.Namely, it was for 20,000 children whom they were trying to receiveinto the country.Not only could we not allow 20,000 Jewish children to enter ourcountry in 1939, that same Congress, with the same speech and rhetoricI am hearing in recent days in this august Chamber, passed hurdle afterhurdle to make it more difficult for those refugees and immigrants toenter our country.See the gap during that time? They were, unfortunately, successful.Mr. Speaker, America protects her liberty and defends her shores notby punishing those who would be free. She does it by guarding libertywith her life. Americans need to sacrifice and wake up. We must notbecome enemies of the very liberty in the fabric of our Republic. Theenemies of liberty win if we give up who we are and, even more so,without a fight.We guard our way of life by vigilance. We must be watchful. We haveto have each other's back as Americans, not as Republicans andDemocrats. By maintaining who we are amidst the threat, amidst thehatred, amidst the trials, we win.Patrick Henry did not say: ``Give me safety and economy or give medeath.'' He said: ``Give me liberty.''We have defended our way of life for roughly 240 years. Now we asAmericans must defend it again. We must defend it when the criticsitting on the couch eating his bag of cheese puffs is pecking outhatred and vitriol. We must defend it and have courage when voters arecaught up with sincere passion, demanding security that might kill ourliberty based on facts that are not true. We must defend it with ourwarriors who have worked hard to keep the fight for freedom off of ourshores.We will always have threats to security and economy, but liberty,when lost, takes generations, if ever, to regain.Will and Ariel Durant, those epic recorders of human history, wrotethis warning: ``Civilization is not inherited; it has to be learned andearned by each generation anew; if the transmission should beinterrupted . . . civilization would die, and we should be savagesagain.''I am asking all Americans to please pray for this Congress andspecifically for our President. How much time have we really spent onour knees at home for our leaders, regardless of what we think of them?How much counsel have we sought from the Almighty?It is God who has given us the spark of freedom. It is God we mustreturn to. He will take us and guide us in times of crisis if only weask Him and humble ourselves and seek His face as a nation.The Apostle James instructs us:If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who givesto all liberally and without reproach, and it will be givento him.Mr. Speaker, maybe our lack of doing that is how we got here in thefirst place.I yield back the balance of my time.",,

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, as I have said before, we hope for the best from the new President, but we must prepare forthe worst.  Everyone who has looked at the record of the key advisers to President-elect Trump on the issue of immigration has reasonfor very deep concern that the new President is going to follow the advice of some of the most extreme voices in the immigrationdebate.  As for the new President himself, he is a bit of an unknown because he changes his mind on key issues just as quickly as hisTwitter feed refreshes. He says he has a plan for this and a plan for that, but they are secret plans, and, as far as we know,they are even secrets to him.  He knows more about computers and the Internet, ISIS and terrorists, Russia and NATO than all of the policy experts puttogether, and he thinks of himself as kind of the ultimate Presidential adviser to the new President.  But it is Trump's lieutenants who worry most of us. They are the most clearly ideological and dangerous set of leaders everassembled in American Government on immigration and any number of issues we care about.  They are vindictive when it comes to our immigrant community. The truth is that among the new President key advisers aresome of the staunchest opponents of legal immigration. They are against legal immigration. That is right.  While we all oppose illegal immigration, and some of us have been working for years to upgrade the American system so thatimmigrants come with visas instead of smugglers, the people with access to the Presidency disagree, and they don't wantimmigrants to come here at all from anywhere.  Look, we have made legal immigration extremely difficult for everyone and simply impossible for most people. And then wehave been relying on deportation, walls, enforcement, and curtailing due process rights for immigrants, and that constitutestheir immigration control strategy for the past 25 years. And it hasn't worked for 25 years.  But the American people want a humane, sustainable, secure, and effective legal immigration system and a way for people whoalready live and work here peacefully in America to be able to do so within the law.  So, Mr. Speaker, this is why I will join a few thousand allies here in Washington this Saturday at the historic MetropolitanAME Church on M Street to send a clear message that immigrants and their allies are standing up for immigrant communities.[[Page H305]]  And check out the Web site. The D.C. rally will be one of more than 50 public actions and marches across America on or aboutthis Saturday the 14th, where leaders of the immigrant rights' movement will stand alongside elected officials, faith, labor,education, and LGBTQ leaders to say: we will not allow mass deportation or immigrant roundups on our watch.                              {time}  1015  That we do not want endless delays that keep families waiting 10, 15, 20 years for a visa. That we don't want people to haveto choose between 10 years in exile or the green card for which they qualify under U.S. law because our laws have been craftedto punish people by keeping them in an undocumented status even when they can apply to be here legally. That we are committed todefending immigrant communities if and when the new President and his henchmen develop Muslim registries or neighborhood sweepsor mass roundups disguised as ``fugitive sweeps.''  We will fight attempts to criminalize immigrants and fight attempts to take away documents from people who are now in thesystem and working on the books, like the 750,000 young people who signed up for DACA. With the BRIDGE Act, we will fight sothat DREAMers are protected from deportation and can lead the fight for millions and millions of other immigrants who have nooptions under our current law.  Let's just be clear, 76 percent of Latinos in this country are citizens of the United States. So three-quarters of us canvote or will soon be able to vote. And for Latinos under 18, the percentage of Latinos who are U.S. citizens is 93 percent. Sodon't think you can deport us into silence.  Don't think that deporting everyone and eliminating legal immigration, as some in the new President's circle may fantasize,will suddenly make Brown people disappear from America. We are here and we are joined by allies of every color, shape, nationalorigin and segment of society. We are men, we are women, we are children, we are straight, we are gay and trans, rich and poor,old and young, and everything in between; and we are locking arms with all of our allies to say that when you come for any ofus, we will force you to come for all of us. We are here to stay and we stand together.  I ask all of those interested to please go to the Web site, www.togetherforimmigrants.com. Join us this Saturday.",,

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Rice) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank the minority leader, Ms. Pelosi, for her plea on behalf of the DACA recipients. She certainly showed great passion and stamina.  I do wonder, however, why she is so concerned now. This is not a new problem. All of these people who qualify for DACA today had to be here by the year 2007. They were here illegally in the United States during those 2 years when Ms. Pelosi served as Speaker of the House and Harry Reid was the leader of a supermajority of Democrats in the Senate and Barack Obama was President, yet she took no action then.  They could have passed a law, rather than having President Obama sign an illegal executive order, and given the DACA kids a pathway to citizenship, but I guess it wasn't a priority then.  Last month, my home county, Horry County, South Carolina, settled a claim brought by the United States Department of Justice. It seems the Department determined that Horry County wasn't doing enough to accommodate students who couldn't speak English.  One would think that wouldn't be much of a problem in South Carolina. We are a long way from our southern border. But as it turns out, according to the Horry County independent newspapers, 5,511 out of the 44,700 students in Horry County Schools spoke English as a second language only. That is 13 percent of the student body in Horry County, South Carolina.  So the school system agreed to pay a claim by paying $600,000 to accommodate those students who couldn't speak English. My constituents back home certainly have sympathy for all children--including the DACA children--but before they resolve this DACA issue, they have one condition. They want the flow of illegal immigrants stopped first, and so do I.  Thirty years ago, we gave amnesty to millions of illegal aliens on the promise that we would stop the flow of illegal immigration. Yet here we sit again. Well, fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.  I am willing to try to find a solution for the DACA folks, but first we have to stop the flow. President Trump has made an offer to resolve the DACA issue. I think it is quite reasonable. He has laid out a good framework: number one, secure the border; number two, end chain migration; number three, end the visa lottery.  Personally, I want to add to that list a legal obligation on employers to check the immigration status of the people they hire. This system called E-Verify is already required in many States, including South Carolina. If E-Verify is required and enforced, it will end the practice of coming here illegally for a job.  In return, under the President's proposal, 1.8 million DACA recipients--which is almost three times what President Obama had proposed--would be granted legal status, but no special pathway to citizenship. They would go to the back of the line like everyone else. DACA recipients are illegal immigrants. Presumably, they were brought here as children by their family members who, presumably, were also here illegally.  But I would like to focus here for a few minutes on legal immigration. You have to differentiate, and people confuse the two. You see, our legal immigration system is quite complex, and most Americans are unaware of the details. But, Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out a few things that are really important for the American public to understand about our legal immigration system.  We accept 1.1 million legal immigrants per year. I would like to refer to this chart for a minute, which I know is hard to see on TV, but as recent as the year 1970, we were accepting 200,000 legal immigrants per year. That number passed 400,000 in about 1980. You can see this big spike. That is when President Reagan promised us that, if we would make the people who were here illegally legal, we would secure this border and we wouldn't have a problem again.  But you see what has happened now, this is legal immigration. It has gone up and up and up to the point now where we are accepting almost 1.2 million legal immigrants per year. If you add on top of that the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants coming in that number is much higher than this. This is only legal immigration.  Mr. Speaker, at 1.1 million legal immigrants, there are people who stand up here and say that we are hard-hearted if we don't accept every illegal immigrant who gets across our border. But the numbers say otherwise. The numbers don't lie.  We are very open to immigration. We still go by the motto on the Statue of Liberty. We accept people from all over the world, 1.2 legal immigrants a year. And look at this slide, Mr. Speaker. This is a representation of the top 10 countries in the world that accept legal immigrants.  You will notice on the far side, here is the United States. This is as of the year 2015. We accepted 1.051 million legal immigrants. The next closest was Germany at 686,000. We are almost twice as much as the next one. And if you add the next five together, we are still more than they are.  So anybody who tells you that our immigration system is hard-hearted is simply ignoring the facts. It is baloney. We have the most open system of legal immigration in the world, by far.  Most countries base their immigration system on merit. Ours, on the other hand, two-thirds of our legal immigrants come in based on chain migration. The criteria is extended family, so we end up importing a lot of people that have low education and low skill sets.  Most countries say, look, we want to use or immigration system to become[[Page H972]]more competitive, to make our economy thrive, to lift not only the immigrants, but the people who live here. So what they say is, if you have a skill set or an educational background that we need, then you move to the front of the line. It makes perfect sense. It makes sense for the immigrant. It makes sense for the economy of the country. It makes sense for the people who live there.  Ours, on the other hand, is based on chain migration. So does that make us more competitive or less competitive?  Mr. Speaker, look at this slide. The top slide here--this is from the Center on Immigration Studies--shows that immigrants, our legal immigrant families, families headed by a legal immigrant in the United States, 51 percent of them get some type of social safety net benefit; 51 percent, as compared to 30 percent for the average family. The head of household is a native-born American. Fifty-one percent of the people that we are bringing into our country under chain migration end up relying on our social safety net.  Mr. Speaker, I have to ask you, it is only common sense. Do you think that makes us more competitive or less competitive? Don't you think that drives up our deficit, Mr. Speaker? Don't you think it takes resources away from people in this country already that need it?  The bottom of this slide represents the amount of dollars from our social safety net that are taken by immigrant families versus Native American families. You can see the average immigrant family getting benefits gets an average of $6,200 a year in benefits, while the average family headed by somebody who was born in America gets $4,400 in benefits.  So it is very easy to see, Mr. Speaker. It is common sense that using chain migration in the visa lottery to determine two-thirds, 65 percent of our immigrants, 800,000 people, the result is that we bring in people with a low education, a low skill set that end up relying on our social safety net and, in fact, make our country less competitive and take resources away from folks at the bottom end of the scale here in America that need these resources.                              {time}  2015  I believe our immigration system is broken. The President believes so too. He has said:       I want a bighearted deal for the DACA kids.  Leader Pelosi is also very concerned about the DACA kids obviously. So we have areas of agreement, and I am glad we do. I look forward to an agreement that takes care of the DREAMers, secures our borders, and moves us to a modern, merit-based immigration system like every other developed country has that lifts our economy and at the same time lifts opportunity for all Americans.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",,

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.                             General Leave  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Hawaii?  There was no objection.  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, our current immigration policies are hurting families, tearing them apart, and deporting people who are part of the very fabric of our communities.  I have a few people in particular I plan to talk about and whose stories I will be sharing, but first I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke ), my colleague and friend.  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii for yielding to me and for her leadership on this issue. I served with her for 2 years on the Homeland Security Committee of the House of Representatives and saw her ability to balance the national interests and capitalizing and maximizing the opportunity that immigrants provide and have always provided to the United States while ensuring that we protect the homeland and our sacred commitment to every person and family that we represent to make sure that they are safe.  I think that the community that I have the honor of representing in Congress, El Paso, Texas, is a case in point. We are one of the safest cities in the United States today.  If you use the FBI's crime statistics as crunched by CQ Press, they routinely rank El Paso, Texas, the safest city in not just the State of Texas, but in the United States. For the last 20 years, we have been the safest, second safest, or third safest in the country. That is not in spite of the fact that we are connected with Mexico--our sister city is Ciudad Juarez--and it is not in spite of the fact that 24 percent of the people that I represent were born in another country, most of them in Mexico.  In fact, our security, our success, our strength is connected to the fact that we are a city of immigrants, that we are connected to the rest of the world through our shared border with Mexico, and that understanding that is critical to preserving the security and public safety which is such a critical part of our job. I will give you an example.[[Page H4691]]  Not too long ago, under this administration, a woman who was an undocumented immigrant from Mexico was in an El Paso County courtroom seeking a protective order because her boyfriend threatened her life. The judge in that courtroom granted that protective order, and as that woman was leaving the courtroom, she was apprehended by a plainclothes Border Patrol agent. That has never, to my knowledge, happened in our community in the El Paso County Courthouse.  The consequences of that are not just that this one person was taken off the streets and placed into detention and custody. The consequence is that we have fewer people from the immigrant community in El Paso coming forward to serve as witnesses to crimes, to report crimes in the first place, to testify, to take part in the criminal justice system in a way that has kept our community safe.  By definition, today, because of that one act, because of the climate of fear and intimidation and anxiety produced by this administration, El Paso, Texas, the State of Texas, this country is less safe.  If we want to respond to the most urgent issue that each constituent of ours depends on us for, that is their safety, their security, that of the community and the country that we serve, then we need to make sure that we treat everyone within our communities that we represent with dignity and respect. We need to make sure that local law enforcement is not seen as a tool of Federal immigration law, but that they are there to preserve and to protect the peace and to serve the constituents and the people who live in those communities.  I would also add that next week marks the fifth anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program implemented under President Obama. It was an important step that this country took to realize the gains that we and future generations will receive by ensuring that those young people who arrived on our shores and through our land ports of entry like El Paso, through no fault of their own, at the tender age of 5 or 6 years old and who are now in school or want to serve in our military or want to create jobs themselves are able to stay here and flourish so that we receive the benefit of their potential.  I hope this Congress, every colleague from both sides of the aisle, will work with me and others to ensure that we have, if not comprehensive immigration reform, which I think should remain the goal, reform in those areas like for the DREAMers and the DACA beneficiaries that is most urgent and to the States that we represent and serve, like Texas, with 200,000 DACA beneficiaries out of 700,000 nationwide. It is the right thing to do for our security. It is the right thing to do for economic growth and job creation. It is the right thing to do in the best interests and traditions of this country.  So I conclude by again thanking the gentlewoman from Hawaii for leading this discussion on this critically important issue, and I thank her for the privilege of being able to speak tonight.  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for his leadership and his commitment to not only the families and the people in his district, but to the challenges that many families are facing all across the country, and I look forward to continuing to work with him on these issues.  Some of these challenges that face families across the country touch my constituents in Hawaii as well. I would like to share a few of their stories and their challenges here today in the hopes that Congress and this administration take action and do the right thing for them and for our country.  We are a nation of immigrants. Andres Magana Ortiz's story is not a new one. It is not one that will surprise anyone.                              {time}  1730  In fact, it will be quite recognizable to most of us. No tradition is as American as telling the stories of our relatives and ancestors who, against all odds and great difficulties, found and made a home here on our shores.  But while our family histories remind us of how far we have come, Andres' story demonstrates the progress that we have yet to make and who is hurt and affected by the lack of that progress today.  Andres Ortiz came to Hawaii seeking the American Dream. With hard work, perseverance, and a little luck, Andres demonstrated what we, as Americans, know to be true and that we strive for: if you work hard, you can succeed and get ahead.  Andres started a new life in 1996 picking coffee--backbreaking, tough work, for anyone who has done it before--in the Kona region on the island of Hawaii. He proved himself smart and capable, and he was soon promoted to supervisor. By 2010, he saved enough to buy his own coffee farm. Today, he owns 20 acres of coffee trees, and manages another 150 acres for his neighbors.  Andres quickly earned a reputation as a knowledgeable and skillful farmer. When an invasive beetle, called the coffee berry borer, began to ravish our Kona coffee farms and trees, Andres began a pioneering system to help his community track and eradicate this infestation, even before our U.S. Department of Agriculture took action. Now, this infestation was not just a small matter. It was something that cost our farmers millions of dollars.  Our country offered Andres the means to become an entrepreneur, and he paid us back in full: he started a business, he creates jobs, he takes care of his workers, and he is a leader in our community. Andres is not a legal resident of Hawaii, but Hawaii owes him a debt for his contributions.  Managing the coffee farm is a family affair for Andres. He is a proud husband and father of three children. His wife and kids are all American citizens, and his kids only know Hawaii as home.  Andres embodies the spirit of the American Dream, and serves as an example of why we should welcome courageous, hardworking immigrants into our community. The reality that Andres faces now, sadly, is far different.  If Andres is deported to Mexico, as is supposed to happen in just a few days, his family, their farm, and Kona coffee growers are going to face an uncertain future. Without Andres to run the business, his family could lose their farm and lose their home. Their neighbors will lose a friend and a business partner. Brenda, his wife, will be without her husband, and their three children will be without their father.  If Andres is forced to leave, the law will keep him from his family for 10 years. Should the family move to Mexico with Andres, they will have to learn a new language and a new culture. His daughter will have to drop out of college at the University of Hawaii and begin a new life in another country. Relocating to Mexico would deprive them of the benefits afforded to the citizens of this country.  Now, unfortunately, Andres's story is not a singular one. Unfortunately, there are more.  Just last week, Graham Ellis of Waimea, a 67-year-old British national and leukemia patient, heard a knock on his door. It was two Department of Homeland Security agents who have come to begin the deportation process back to the U.K. after Graham had made Hawaii his home for over 36 years. After a few short minutes of conversation in front of his wife, Dena, who is an American citizen, Graham agreed to turn himself in at a field office in Honolulu the following day.  Now, like Mr. Ortiz, Graham is a pillar within our community in Hawaii. But unlike Mr. Ortiz, Graham had already made the decision to return to the U.K. because he feared that deportation was inevitable under the heightened threats faced under our current immigration policies. Graham had made the decision to leave by the end of summer, thinking that these remaining months would give him time to get his affairs in order, and say good-bye to the community and the home that he grew to love for so long.  A circus performer by training, Graham spent much of his life in Hawaii teaching children from low-income and at-risk communities circus arts, bringing smiles and laughter to their faces and their lives.  He served on the Puna Community Council, and was the founding president of the Kalapana Seaview Estates Community Association.  In his remaining final months, he had planned to make a trip to Kauai, where he would instruct his last group of young, passionate students at a 2-week[[Page H4692]]superhero-themed circus camp before shutting it down for good.  Our immigration system is broken. We need a pathway to citizenship for immigrants to ensure people who deserve to be here can find a way to be a part of our great country. We need real immigration reform that keeps families together and integrates hardworking, tax-paying immigrants into our community. We need to preserve, protect, and restore the values that underlie the greatness of our country.  I stand with Andres and Graham and the millions of hardworking immigrants who built our great Nation; and I stand with these immigrants who live in my community, who live in my district, and who have a proven record of upstanding contributions to our community.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Soto), my colleague.  Mr. SOTO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the beautiful State of Hawaii for yielding to me, and I thank her also for being a champion of immigrants, both in her State and across the Nation.  It is Immigrant Heritage Month this month, and I think it is critical that we take a few moments to talk about the state of immigration here in the United States. I can't do that any better than by talking about a few stories of what I have experienced over the past few months.  On January 27 of this year, we saw President Trump sign his executive order, quite expeditiously, on a travel ban that specifically targeted the Muslim community, with seven countries, where 90-plus percent of the population practice Islam.  It was an interesting moment for me. My wife and I were having dinner with a few friends of ours in the district, and one of them had asked me: Well, how is this ban going to affect you? How is it going to affect your district?  At the moment, I wasn't really sure, but then I got a call only a few minutes later by my district director. Our first constituent was identified as coming back on a United Arab Emirates flight back from Iraq and was scheduled to land the next morning: a girl who had graduated from the University of Central Florida and lived a very productive life as a legal resident in central Florida for the last 6 years after her graduation.  So we went the next day--early the next morning because, if anything, my legislative experience in the State legislature has told me: go to where the action is, go to where the controversy is, and do what you can to help.  First, we went to Customs and Border Protection, and we got no response. We actually got surprise responses of what were we even doing there, because this was not a matter they were prepared to handle.  So we went to the airport and were greeted by Greater Orlando Aviation Authority officials who were very helpful and understood that these were central Floridians who had been flying for 20 hours and were just about to arrive back into Florida, where they lived.  That morning, I also met a young man who was a citizen from an area just north of the district, who was waiting for his two parents to come in on the same Emirates flight. We found out that the constituent and the two parents were three people who were held back and questioned.  Throughout the day, we would get updates, but what we found out is there was very little information because there was very little understanding by Customs and Border Protection about how to implement this very vague order. The court had just ruled that it was potentially unconstitutional.  So working with our local officials after hours of building up, hours of waiting with the families, hours of press starting to arrive, hours of TV coverage, and hours of protest, right when we were in the middle of doing interviews, that is when the families were finally released, after 7 hours of being questioned without water, without food, after a 20-hour flight.  You could not have scripted this to make the point of how misguided this ban was than what happened. Right in front of TV cameras from across central Florida, first, the two parents came down--parents of a citizen who hadn't seen his parents in over 5 years.  The scene was traumatic: crying, hugs, and welcomed by cameras wondering what had happened to these two individuals. These were simply two citizens of Iraq trying to come over to visit their son, who had already been given visas to come on over.  A few minutes later, our constituent finally arrived as well. She also had been held for 8 hours without water, without food, after a 20-hour flight, and a barrage of questions.  After that, we saw public opinion change sharply in central Florida as people saw these were the alleged people that were getting extreme vetting: people who were visiting their son in central Florida, longtime residents, who only had productive lives in central Florida.  A few weeks later, we had the deportation force memo come down. I was shocked. We sent out letters to our sheriffs, we sent out letters to our schools, asking if they were planning on participating in this deportation force that President Trump had called upon to help implement and enforce our immigration laws.  We called immediately a round table, where we invited immigrant groups, we invited law enforcement groups, and so many others to talk about the issues that were happening.  Two of my three sheriffs immediately said they weren't planning on participating, that this was a Federal issue. A third ended up going from fully participating to, a day later, walking back that position, to just picking up folks who had been accused of violent felonies.  Then our schools responded very quickly after they were posed with a scenario--a situation that was going down the very same day: a citizen, a young woman of Mexican descent, whose parents were also legal immigrants, was asked in front of their classmates about her status.  Afterwards, there were a lot of finger-pointing and excuses that these were questions that were being levied to determine whether she needed to participate in the ESEA program. But at that moment, it was just more of this anti-immigrant rhetoric that was coming out of so many areas in central Florida.  But like that incident, which was covered at length, minds and hearts changed in central Florida. There was an apology given to this young woman who was a citizen, and they changed the policy so that no one would be asked about immigration status in front of their peers, even if it was for something as harmless as the ESEA program.  With our sheriffs clarifying their policies to not join this DHS call for deportation force, we were proud once again to have an inclusive society in central Florida where we welcome everybody. We are such an international community, home to the best theme parks in the world, a world-class convention center and hotels, and we welcome everybody from across the globe.  Then, in addition, I just received a letter from a constituent. Her daughter had grown up, gotten a job, fallen in love, and had a bright future ahead of her. But she worried because her daughter's boyfriend potentially could be deported because he is on an H-1 visa.  These types of policies breaking up families don't serve any interest in helping people pursue the American Dream and don't serve any interest in protecting our economy and protecting growth in central Florida, where we have such a large cattle industry and where we have such a large citrus industry.  Finally, we have so many DREAMers, young students, who live in central Florida, who are working and striving, rising up in our society, and helping people along the way, immigrants who potentially could be one of 40 percent of creators of Fortune 500 companies that have been created here in America, one of the 65,000 servicemen and -women who are immigrants, who serve in our United States military. And we find that, with every 100 immigrants, we are creating 120 new jobs because our country has been founded and created on growth and equality.                              {time}  1745  So I would like to see a few things happen, things that I believe Democrats and Republicans can agree on. First, let's make sure to ratify the DREAMer program, the Deferred Action program. You have bipartisan cosponsorship for this bill. This is something we could get done, especially for[[Page H4693]]our veterans and those serving in our U.S. military.  In addition, I believe that we need to relook at the H-1 visa program, the farmworker program. We need to acknowledge the reality that we have had for the last 150 years of agriculture here in the United States, which is that we rely on many of our immigrants coming from Mexico and Central and South America to help with our agriculture. This has been going on for over a century.  What we can do is simply go from a 1-year to maybe a 3-year or 5-year program. I know our immigrants' rights community would support it. I know our agriculture communities would support it; and we wouldn't have people unwittingly not getting back to their country of origin after the 1-year visa expires, when they just want to go back and come back again to help out as seasonal labor.  Then thirdly, there is an arbitrary cap on highly skilled workers here in this country. We train them in Ivy League schools, in brilliant schools in Texas, California, Florida, and across this Nation. And then, because of an arbitrary cap that no one wants to change because of the hot-button issue of immigration, then we send them on their way, back to their countries of origin, rather than keep them here and harness their talent for the future of our economy.  Canada has even got word of this and welcomes these folks. When they realize their visas are up, they beg them to come to Canada to help start new businesses.  So these are some of the ideas that we can fix, that we could all agree on, that both parties can agree on. And of course, in the end, we need a comprehensive immigration reform. But, in the meantime, let's get some things done that we all agree on and move our country forward.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii, one of the most beautiful States of the Union, for her leadership.  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend from Florida for complimenting my State, but for, most importantly, again, putting a face and names to those who are suffering as a result of our broken immigration policy.  You know, for us here, we can stand here and talk about policies and debate them and talk about legislation that needs to be passed. But it is really those folks at home who make it all very real. It is not just a bill number, it is their own family that is being torn apart, it is their own children who are being affected.  Now, you know, I talked about Mr. Ortiz in Hawaii. He and his family are going through this, as we speak, where, in just a few days, he faces being deported. He and his family have exhausted all the options available to them, given the time that they have.  Our delegation from Hawaii, both my colleague, Congresswoman Hanabusa, as well as our Senators, Senator Hirono and Senator Schatz, we have all sent a letter to Secretary Kelly, Department of Homeland Security, urging him to reconsider this order and to halt Mr. Ortiz's deportation, taking a consideration to him and his circumstance and his longstanding commitment and leadership in our community.  I have introduced legislation, H.R. 2794, which is what is called a private bill, specifically for the relief of Andres Magana Ortiz. And the purpose of this bill is to help Mr. Ortiz with his extremely challenging situation and to help him on his own path to citizenship.  I urge Chairman Goodlatte to give positive consideration to this bill that has been referred to his committee. I urge Secretary Kelly, the Department of Homeland Security, to revisit their policy and their decision and to put a halt on Mr. Ortiz's deportation. He is not just a number. He is not just a statistic. He and his family are facing this reality today.  It is always the right time to do the right thing, and I urge these leaders to do that right thing.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",,

Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.  Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, in June, seven American heroes died on a dark night when a ship collided with an American destroyer, the USS Fitzgerald. Among the dead were immigrants from Vietnam and the Philippines, as well as sons of workers who journeyed north from Guatemala.  As one of the sailors who survived explained: You are crammed in with all sorts of cultures on the ship, but when you are on the Fitzgerald, you are family.  Just like the Fitzgerald, my unit in Iraq included men of many races and religions. We were a family, too, and it made us stronger.  Madam Speaker, what is true of our military is also true of our country. Lots of nations have democratic institutions, plenty of countries have good schools, and all too many, as we know, wield powerful weapons; but what makes America great, what makes America powerful, and what makes America America is that, since our founding, we have thrown our doors open to the world, and we have kept them open to the strivers and the dreamers from every corner of the globe.  We didn't become the greatest, most powerful country in the world because we let in a certain group of people and then slammed the door behind them. No, Madam Speaker, we built this country by making America the only country in the world where anyone from anywhere can accomplish anything.  President Reagan may have summed it up best when he explained that:  You can go to Japan to live but you cannot become Japanese. You can go to France to live and not become a[[Page H1204]]Frenchman. Anyone can come to America to live and become an American.  Unfortunately, our current President and his friends in Congress want to turn their backs on what made America great. Their anti-immigrant agenda will lead to the deportation of millions and drastic cuts in legal immigration.  The last time Congress restricted immigration in this way was almost 100 years ago. Back then, conservatives were worried that there were too many Italians and Jews who were arriving on our shores. Now, they are concerned about Mexican, Nigerian, and Chinese immigrants. The rhetoric may have shifted, the targets may have changed, but it is the same kind of backward, un-American thinking that existed then.  The American people are too smart for this. We don't fear people who don't speak like us or look like us or even pray the way we do. Time and time again, we have rejected the racists and the nativists of this country. We have done it before, and we will do it again.  Madam Speaker, I don't have to look at the polls to tell you that there are a lot more Americans like Aaron Chamberlin from Phoenix than like Donald Trump.  Aaron is a restaurant owner in Phoenix. When he learned that a young prep chef named Suny Santana was undocumented, Aaron said Suny could stay as long as he found a way to fix his undocumented status.  Thankfully, Suny qualified for DACA. He worked hard and thrived. In fact, he did so well that Aaron offered to partner with him in opening his very own new restaurant in downtown Phoenix. But then, cruelly and without warning, President Trump terminated DACA and stripped away Suny's status, throwing his entire life into limbo.  Democrats are fighting for Dreamers like Suny and for businessowners like Aaron who believe in them.  We are also fighting for veterans like Miguel Perez of Chicago. Miguel has lived in this country since he was 8 years old. He served two tours in Afghanistan and suffers from PTSD as a result of his service. Unfortunately, as is too often the case with us, this led to problems with addiction. Miguel deserves our support. Instead, he is facing deportation.  As I speak, Miguel is currently sitting in an ICE detention center in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which happens to be in the district of our Speaker, Paul Ryan.  Miguel isn't alone. Hundreds of immigrants who served our country in uniform could now be deported at the behest of a President who has never served one day in service to this country. These are men and women who took an oath to protect and defend this Nation. They have earned the right to call this country home. They have earned the right to call themselves Americans. To deport these brave men and women after they have fought under our flag dishonors the service of all of us who risked our lives for this country.  We must find a way to protect Dreamers and immigrant families, including brave immigrants who served in uniform. The American people are on our side. They know that Trump's fearful vision for our future is incompatible with who we are as Americans. They are proud to live in a country that attracts the brightest minds and the hardest workers from all around the world. They understand that exclusion and hate are the exact opposite of what makes America America.  This Nation did not become great by kicking out immigrants who fight hard like Miguel or who dream big like Suny. Unlike every other country on Earth, we aren't defined by where we come from, but we are defined by what we believe.  Donald Trump may not understand that, but the American people do.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",,
Republican,https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2018/2/15/senate-section/article/s1149-1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22immigration%22%5D%7D&r=6,"IMMIGRATION  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think it is safe to say it has been a disappointing week. I kept my commitment and set aside the entire week for a broad and productive debate over DACA, border security, and other important immigration issues. My friend the Democratic leader, the assistant Democratic leader, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus--everyone agrees that I held up my end of the bargain.  Back in December, I stated that if a bill that stood a chance of becoming law were ready in January, I would bring it to the floor. No such proposal was produced.  Then, in January, when Democrats shut down the government over this issue, I offered to dedicate this week--this week that we have been in--to an immigration debate and a fair amendment process. I just did that, but the same Democrats failed to produce a solution and, instead, spent the better part of the week objecting to any votes in the Senate.  I thought we might be able to resolve this. I was hoping we could reach a bipartisan solution that could pass the Senate, pass the House, and earn President Trump's signature. But, once again, when the hour came to actually make law instead of just making political points, our friends across the aisle were either unable or unwilling to get something done. After all the talk--all the talk--they hardly came to the table at all.  I supported the plan introduced by Chairman Grassley and several other cosponsors. It fleshed out the President's framework, pairing a more than generous solution for 1.8 million illegal immigrants with commonsense steps to reform legal immigration, secure the border, and help law enforcement keep Americans safe.  In my view, the President came a very long way--clearly, more than halfway--to meet the Democrats on this issue. In exchange for a pathway to citizenship--not just legal status, but a pathway to citizenship--for nearly 2 million individuals, he sensibly wanted to reform pieces of our broken immigration system, secure our border, and make it harder for violent criminals and repeat offenders to prey on American citizens. That is more than a fair bargain--more than a fair bargain.  I thought our friends across the aisle would jump at this opportunity to fulfill what they say is their top priority, but they just couldn't take yes for an answer. They turned away from a golden opportunity to solve the issue. They decided they would rather come away emptyhanded, with no resolution whatsoever for the 1.8 million individuals they say they are championing, than accept a reasonable compromise with the President of the United States.  Even though this week has been squandered, this does not have to be the end of our efforts to resolve these matters. I would encourage Members to put away the talking points and get serious about finding a solution that can actually become law.  I remain eager to improve our immigration policy. If a solution is developed in the future that can pass both the House and the Senate and be signed into law by the President, it should be considered.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) for 5 minutes.  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, as part of the Immigration Act of 1990, the diversity visa lottery was established as a way to diversify the United States. Over the past 28 years, the visa lottery has helped to fortify the image of our country and enlarge the greatness of America through the immigrant population. The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program awards up to 50,000 visas each year that presents permanent residency in the U.S. and serves as a pathway to citizenship.  The lottery has been imperative in creating new opportunities for African and Caribbean individuals seeking citizenship in the U.S. The proposed immigration bills today that will be coming to the floor aim to limit refugee admissions, eliminate the diversity lottery, and reduce the number of employment-based visas distributed each year.  As Americans begin many of the pastimes of summer that are quintessentially American--baseball, backyard barbecues, and family road trips--Caribbean Americans reflect on our contributions and the melded culture in the United States through Caribbean American Heritage Month. Ironically, the bills that are coming on the floor this same month will end the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, which has allowed many Caribbean people to come and be part of the American experience.  In a month of polarized politics and the Trump administration's assault on increasing diversity in this Nation, Caribbean American Heritage Month serves as a perfect counterpoint example to support the doctrine of Americanism.  Congress and President George W. Bush adopted Caribbean American Heritage Month in 2006. While the act establishing Caribbean American Heritage Month emphasized the present influence of Caribbean Americans, American history would not be complete without the integration and support of the Caribbean people.  From America's founding to the present, Caribbean people have supported and assisted in the creation of a collective American identity: the articulation of this Nation's rightful place in the world, its traditions, its language, and its cultural style.  From Alexander Hamilton, to American Revolution Haitian gens de couleur libre--free men of color--fighting troops, to slave revolt leader Denmark Vessey, to Colin Powell's shock and awe doctrine, the Caribbean emphasis on revolutionary and righteous ideals enforced through martial action have supported American ideals both at home and abroad.  In today's culture, many are surprised by the placement of Americans of Caribbean descent. They include former Attorney General Eric Holder to iconic personalities like Lenny Kravitz and Beyonce; economic minds such as Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic; to actors Kerry Washington and Jada Pinkett Smith; to athletes Tim Duncan, Mariano Rivera, and Carmelo Anthony; to journalist Joy Reid and U.S. Senator Kamala Harris.  These scions of the Caribbean region are completely American, yet, in many ways, their Caribbean heritage informs and accounts for the attributes which have assisted them in their advancement and supported American greatness.  That philosophy is borne out with recent immigrants and naturalized Caribbean people. According to the Migration Policy Institute, Latin American and Caribbean people account for the largest percent of foreign-born military personnel, and that group constitutes 38 percent of all foreign born that are in the Armed Forces.  Additionally, according to the 2014 U.S. Census Bureau Report, about 66 percent of Caribbean immigrants and immigrants overall were in the civilian labor force, compared to 62 percent of the native born.  According to the Caribbean Policy Institute, Caribbean Blacks have labor force participation rates that exceed the averages for U.S. natives and all immigrants combined. The study from this institute has shown that, collectively, Caribbean people have higher median income earnings than all the immigrants in the U.S.  The proposed zero-tolerance immigration policy has resulted, as we have seen, in thousands of children being torn apart from their families. Children are being held in prolonged family detention centers, and this bill eliminates protections that are in place to ensure safe and basic living needs.  It is our duty to stop the separation of children. It is our duty to see that America remains great through the diversity that it entails. We cannot allow this bill to go forward, which would eliminate the diversity lottery that has created the diverse American culture that we have.  Through service, through ideals, and even through protests, immigrants have made this a great nation.  President Trump issued a proclamation on May 31, 2018, which stated that Caribbean American Heritage Month is a time in which America will honor America's long-shared history with our[[Page H5230]]neighbors, but he would appear to be ignorant of the fact that it is not a shared history. Our neighbor's history is our American history.",,

We need legal, verifiable, and skilled or the educatable to be workers coming in all ranges of skills.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, June is Immigrant Heritage Month in the United States, but to celebrate that, House Republicans have made this anti-immigration week in the Congress.  The advocates against legal immigration have their annual talk radio festival here in D.C. this week to extol the virtues of cutting off legal immigration.  Dozens of conservative talk radio hosts set up remote broadcasts here to talk about why criminalizing immigrants and turning misdemeanors into felonies is a good thing for America. They may trade stories, while broadcasting on the air, about immigrants doing horribly bad things to people in America, as if we were in a national crime spree of Brown people killing White people.  The goal of talk radio hosts is to reinforce the anti-immigration fever that has gripped the Republican Party and allowed a tough-sounding game show host to take over their party.  The main organization behind the gathering of talk radio hosts is FAIR, the Federation Against American Immigration Reform, which we should note is designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. That is the organization in Alabama most directly responsible for suing the KKK out of the mainstream.  It is like D. W. Griffith might rise up from his grave to film ``Rebirth of a Nation--the Sequel'' because FAIR and its allies want to take our immigration policies back to the 1920s when the Klan marched openly in Washington and legal immigration was reduced to almost zero. They want to get rid of anyone here who is deportable or could be deportable by passing new laws to criminalize them.  Now, to coincide with the talk radio anti-immigration week, Republicans are putting on a passion play of their own in the House of Representatives by bringing two anti-immigrant bills to the floor.  So we have a coordinated campaign from broadcasters, lawmakers, and the anti-immigration advocates to pressure Congress into passing bills to paint immigrants as a threat to our national and community safety--right out of the Trump playbook.  The question is not whether or not these bills will pass the House--they will pass--but whether Democrats will be tempted to vote for tough-sounding measures because they are afraid to be labeled by conservative talk radio hosts as weak on punishing the ``murdering, rapist, drug-dealing Mexicans'' they think are lurking in every alley.  Of course, that is not what these bills actually do at all. Truth and talk radio do not often go together--certainly not in the era of Trump.  Let's look at the two bills Republicans are bringing for a vote.  One bill is H.R. 3004, named for Kate Steinle, a young woman who was shot and killed by an immigrant nearly 2 years ago in San Francisco. It happened in July, and as you may remember, I was the first person to come to the floor and give a speech denouncing Kate's killer and calling for laws that keep people like him off the streets.  A week later, while talking about various immigration issues in Spanish with Telemundo, a quote was included in a story about Kate Steinle's killing. After it was aired, rightwing groups circulated it, alleging it was proof that I was insensitive to the Steinle family, when, in fact, I was not speaking about Kate Steinle at the time, and I had already spoken out specifically on Kate's death here on the floor.  But what is coming to the floor this week would not have kept Kate Steinle's killer off the streets. It would have had no impact on that case whatsoever. Instead, we are voting on a bill to put other people in different circumstances in jail for longer periods of time.  It is a bait-and-switch strategy: use a horrible tragedy to sell a policy that would not have prevented that death so that we put more immigrants in jail for longer periods of time and prevent them from ever living legally in the United States.  The other bill, H.R. 3003, is designed to take money away from America's largest cities and counties, specifically from efforts to fight crime--yes, take money away from them. Grants that would help local police fight crime would be eliminated under this bill from 600 of the country's largest jurisdictions. That doesn't sound like crime fighting, because it isn't.  So why are we doing this? Because Republicans in Washington think they have a better idea of how to fight crime than the county executives, State legislators, mayors, and local police chiefs. ``Do what we say or we will take away your money'' is what the Republicans are saying to big cities and counties.  That is the approach being taken by the conservatives who always talk about how State and local people should be trusted more and protected from Federal mandates. Well, I guess, not when it comes to immigrants. This is why these types of bills are opposed by the National Fraternal Order of Police and other police organizations.  So to all the talk radio hosts and advocacy groups: Why are you on the side opposing the National Fraternal Order of Police? And why would any Democrat want to cross that blue line to stand with you?",,
Republican,https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2018/1/18/senate-section/article/s288-1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22immigration%22%5D%7D&r=13,"IMMIGRATION  Mr. PERDUE. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments about the current immigration system. That seems to be the topic of the day recently. I want to tell you some of us have been working on this for years. Some in this body have been working on it at least the last decade. Three times in the last 11 years, this body has tried to solve this problem unsuccessfully.  I believe one of the problems with each of those solutions or attempts at a solution was they tried to be comprehensive. People are misusing that word today when they talk about what we are trying to do on this side. These three attempts, over the last 11 years, attempted to solve not just the illegal situation and the temporary work visa situation, but they also tried to solve the legal situation. They tried to solve all of this.  Today, what we are trying to do on our side is to solve just the illegal immigration system before we even talk about DACA. The legal situation is this: 1.1 million green cards are given out every year today. That is up from 300,000 in 1965, when this bill--the law we operate under today--was first passed. What we believe is, if we get this done, then the next step would be to move to the temporary work visas, where we give out 2.2 million temporary work visas every year. Those need desperate work. Both sides agree to that. Some categories probably need to be increased; others need to be streamlined. There might need to be a new category created, but that needs speciality work.  Then, of course, we have to deal with the people who are here illegally. Remember, 40 percent of the people here illegally, or thereabouts, came into this country under a legal temporary work visa or a student visa, or some other form of temporary visa and overstayed their visa. We are one of the few countries in the developed world that can't track overstays, but that is not what we are trying to do. We are trying to bring focus to an issue that will stop this continuing evolution of immigration problems.  I believe there is a better way, and there is a proposition to do just that. There was a meeting in the White House last week on Tuesday, and the President started out the conversation--it was bipartisan, bicameral. You heard my colleague from Iowa Senator Grassley talk about this. As part of that meeting, I was moved by how the President introduced this topic. He said, with regard to the DACA situation, we need to develop a compassionate approach that demonstrates love in dealing with these young people who are here illegally but through no fault of their own. The President, in that meeting, defined the scope, and he brought a sense of urgency to this topic. He expects a result.  He undid what we believe was an illegal act by the past President in giving work status to these individuals, and said--now this is President Trump--he said: This is the responsibility of Congress to put a law in place to deal with this. I agree with that, but let's be very clear about what is going on right now. We are not debating what to do with the DACA individuals, mostly aged 15 to 36.  My colleagues spoke last night as though they are the only ones committed to solving the DACA problem. That is not true. People on both sides of the aisle--in this body and in the House--believe we need to solve this problem. These individuals did not break the law, their parents did. We all agree there is a solution to be had. Again, the question is whether we are going to solve DACA without dealing with the things that created it in the first place.  The President was very clear last week--and he has been consistent on this issue, as have those of us who have been working on this over the last year, this new, focused approach on legal immigration. The President made it very clear that any solution on DACA has to include border security--including a wall--an end to chain migration, and an end to this perverse diversity visa lottery.  If we don't actually solve what created this, we are going to be right back here in just a few years. That is the problem I have with the bill that is being discussed here, this so-called Graham-Durbin exercise. I just don't know why we would do that and knowingly put ourselves in the same position in just a few years.  Haven't we learned our lesson from what we did in 1986, 1991? We know kicking the can down the road on this is not going to give us any solution, but we have an opportunity because we have commonality in this body about what we need to do going forward with not only the DACA situation but this legal immigration system. There is a great deal of commonality in thought. I have done deals in the business world, and when you get this level of commonality, a deal should get done. There is a lot of symmetry here to be had if we would just talk with each other and[[Page S289]]get at the real issues and put political issues aside.  If we give DACA recipients a path for legal status without a real investment in border security and a wall, we are going to further incentivize a new wave of illegal immigration.  By the way, the President has said this publicly. It is not necessarily a 2,000-mile wall, but it is a system of constraints where we know that we can protect our southern borders. It is not just an immigration issue; it is a national security issue, as has been demonstrated by two acts of terror just in recent months. The plans I heard last night don't even address that seriously. A $1.8 billion allocation is not a serious attempt at that. The Dream Act--the estimated cost back in 2013 for doing that was $26 billion. Today, who knows what that estimate would be. It has to be greater than that.  The second criteria in this was that if we are going to solve the DACA problem and eliminate the things that created this issue going forward, we have to deal with how to protect the family of the immigrant, the primary worker. We must protect the immediate family of the person who is sponsored and comes in as a citizen. But I believe there is a great deal of confusion about that. This is the so-called chain migration. There is nothing derogatory about that term. That was a term used by the Gang of 8 in 2013. The Democratic leader and the whip of the Democrats right now all used that term repeatedly. There was nothing derogatory and there is certainly nothing prejudicial about that term; it was a mere description of what happens in the current law.  The current law says this: The person sponsored for citizenship comes in as a legal permanent resident, moves through a period of time, and becomes a citizen. If they apply, they become a citizen. After that process, as a citizen, they can then sponsor their spouse, their immediate minor children, their family, their adult married children, their adult unmarried children, their parents, and their siblings. The only thing we are talking about is limiting that to the primary worker and their immediate family, and that would break the so-called chain as described by our Members across the aisle.  Let's be very clear. Seventy-two percent of Americans believe that immigration should be limited to the individual worker, their spouse, and their immediate family. Again, the only difference between that ethos and what we have today are the parents and the siblings.  Somebody says: Well, I want to protect the family.  Well, so do we. But whose family? The family of the sponsored worker or their parents' family or their parents' parents' family or their parents' parents' siblings' family? Which family? I believe the American people have spoken loud and clear about which family.  There is a significant portion who believe it should just be the worker, but that is not our position. We believe we need to protect the family of that immediate worker.  There are some of us who are trying to get to a merit-based immigration system like Canada and Australia have been using for decades and they have proven works. It helps their society, builds their economy, and opens their doors with a welcoming hand for those who want to come. Canada is no bastion of conservatism in its immigration policy. Yet it has a merit-based immigration system.  Now, we are not proposing that. We are happy to wait for phase two, which the President talked about last week. Many people on the other side have absolutely discredited his words and confused them knowingly. What the President is talking about right now is, focus on this legal immigration system, solve DACA, solve the border crisis, eliminate the chain migration issue, and eliminate the diversity visa lottery. It is just that simple.  The diversity visa lottery is the last thing in his scope, and it is so easy. We all know that needs to be eliminated. The issue comes up in their bill that they want to reallocate the 50,000 people who are coming in today. We know that the diversity visa lottery is fraught with fraud. We know that it has been related to at least one act of terrorism, and it needs to be eliminated. How to do it is the question. Well, let's talk about that.  There is no reason why that can't be negotiated. But the Graham-Durbin bill, if it is ever offered, ensures that we will be right back here in a few short years. What we want is to have a solution on the DACA side and protect America from repeating this mistake again and again and again.  Let me be very clear. If we do what is on the table today in the Graham-Durbin bill, it would allow the parents of DACA recipients legal status. This would ignite future waves of parents entering the United States, putting their children at risk as they come across the border illegally. Thank God most of us have never had to deal with that. Imagine putting your children at risk coming across the border illegally. But then their children will eventually be given legal status, according to this bill and precedent, and then they will be able to sponsor their parents, who broke the law in the first place. Then here we go, reigniting another wave. So we have not done anything to prevent being right back here just a few short years from now.  I believe it is time for action. My colleagues last night talked about, well, nobody is offering up any other solution. Well, that is just not true. There are three Republican Senate bills right now that relate to this issue, active bills that have been filed, and they are out there. The language is out there. You can read them. There is one bill in the House. Chairman Goodlatte was there in committee and brought out a bill. So it is just not true that we don't have things to talk about on the Republican side on this issue. What is missing in this process is a good-faith effort to negotiate the details of a deal and make it happen.  To try to make an end run on that process is not going to work. I don't believe it, and I don't think the American people want it. What they want is to solve DACA and ensure that we are not doing it again in just a few short years. This means that we need a real investment in border security. We need to put a focus on the immediate family of the sponsored new U.S. citizen, the family of the incoming immigrant, and we need to end this archaic, outdated diversity visa lottery.  The solutions are here. I might not be 100 percent happy, they might not be 100 percent happy, but I promise you that in my experience, this situation is closer to a deal, a negotiated deal right now because both sides really want to see an end to the situation where there is a question about the DACA recipients. But we want to make sure we are not back here in 5 years or even sooner dealing with the same problem again. That is the lesson we should have learned from 1986 and 1991.  It is an honor to be in this body, but it is time for action. It is time to get to point B. We know we have been trying for over a decade with many Members of this body who are well-intended. I, for one, am ready to negotiate. The President is ready to negotiate. Let's get together and make this happen. It is time for action. The American people demand it. But let's please don't tie this solution to the funding of the Federal Government. That is totally irresponsible. Our men and women in uniform deserve better.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.",,

Mr. Speaker, Saturday marks the end of Immigrant Heritage Month, an annual tradition dedicated to celebrating the contributions immigrants have made to communities all across the country.  Our Nation was founded by immigrants. The very existence of our entire democracy, of this institution, is the result of compromise and consensus by the descendants of immigrants, and today our Nation continues to owe a great debt of gratitude to the contributions of more recent arrivals who are an essential part of daily life, our economy, and our society.  I had hoped we would be able to close out this celebration with the news that, for the first time in a long time, Congress had come together to fix our broken, inefficient, unfair immigration system. Instead, a bipartisan majority decided to double down on the status quo: a porous border, uncertainty for the victims of a broken immigration system, and continued division between Americans over the issue of immigration.  Despite this setback, I am hopeful that, working with any colleague that is willing to do so in this House, I and other Members can find a solution to this broken immigration system and, in doing so, help heal our country's politics.",,

Mr. President, I said I wanted to talk about the issue our Democratic colleagues shut down the government over last month, and that issue is immigration and the path forward on DACA. DACA, again, is Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals. This is something President Obama did unilaterally, circumventing Congress, assuring that in a new administration, it would be called into question, not only in the courts but also by the new administration.  President Trump, recognizing that the courts had effectively said what President Obama tried to do was illegal, basically continued it for a time to give Congress a chance to try to respond, and he has given us a deadline of March 5. I heard my friend from Illinois blame President Trump for trying to fix a problem that was caused by an overreach by the previous administration. Don't take my word for it, take the courts which struck down the DACA Program.  President Trump has continued it long enough to give Congress a chance to fix it. That is the appropriate response. It is not helpful just to engage in the blame game. We actually need to step up and not just give speeches on the floor of the Senate; we need to actually enter into a good-faith negotiation.  To date, President Trump has issued a reasonable framework that will not only give protection to those who were brought here illegally by their parents as children but also fixes other gaps in our broken immigration system--border security, the diversity lottery visa, and ensures that people who are waiting in line patiently can be unified with their family by narrowing the scope of family-based immigration in the future. That is prospective only. One proposal has been to plow those additional green cards into accelerating the passage of people who are patiently waiting in line--some as many as 10 and 20 years.  President Trump has done something President Obama never did. He has offered 1.8 million young adults who are currently DACA recipients and DACA-eligible an opportunity to get on a pathway to American citizenship. That is three times more than the young adults who were addressed by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program that President Obama did unilaterally. That is an incredibly generous offer.  What has the President requested in return or in addition? He said: Secondly, I want to secure our borders, and I want to address legal loopholes in the current law. That is important because we have to protect our citizens and regain the public trust. One of the very reasons this President was elected is because people are angry that the Federal Government has failed them when it comes to securing our borders and enforcing our laws. I believe the second pillar of what President Trump has talked about, border security, is really a system of physical infrastructure--fence, walls, barriers--but also technology and personnel; that those[[Page S623]]are the three essential ingredients in border security. We have to ensure that people don't flout the law and enter the country illegally. We all know a porous border is an opportunity for drug traffickers, human traffickers, and other criminals to exploit our porous border. As I said, it is not one-dimensional, it is not just about a wall or a fence or a barrier, it is about technology, personnel, and physical infrastructure as well, and the President has acknowledged as much.  I have heard our colleagues across the aisle bridle at what the President has requested in terms of not only a plan for border security but also for the funding. He said he wants $25 billion to make sure the Federal Government finally steps up and lives up to its responsibility on the border. It wasn't that long ago when the Gang of 8--Senator Durbin my friend from Illinois was one of the gang members--proposed and the Senate passed a bill by 68 votes that provided $50 billion for border security. It had other problems, but they were more than generous in providing for border security. Today they chafe and resist and refuse basically to negotiate on this item, when they voted for double that amount in the so-called Gang of 8 bill just a few years ago.  The President's third pillar relates to what is known as the diversity lottery visa. Many, including the President, have questioned whether it makes sense to just give out 50,000 green cards a year based on a lottery--a game of chance. They have suggested and the President has proposed that we use those green cards to reward skill and merit.  We ought to look at immigration as a way for us to attract the best and brightest, the people who have skills, talents, education, something to offer their new country when they come here. We don't have to end the diversity part, but we can add to it the skills that would help make our country better and allow these new citizens to contribute in a substantial way to their adopted country.  The fourth pillar addresses family unification. I say ``family unification'' because I think the recently adopted alternative term of ``chain migration'' has become a pejorative and oversimplifies a very complex area of the law. What the President has proposed is, in the future, we allow people to immigrate to the country based on family relationships, and we confine that to the nuclear family--mom, dad, and the kids. One suggestion has been that the green cards we would save by not allowing collateral family members to come in--married adult children, aunts, uncles, cousins, and the like, based strictly on the family relationship--we could plow those green cards back into the backlog because there are people who have been playing by the rules and waiting patiently in line, some for 10 or 20 years because of the caps we put on country immigration. Why doesn't it make sense to let them reunite with their family members even faster so they don't have to wait so long? I think that makes an awful lot of sense. During the time that backlog clears, there really wouldn't be any reduction in legal immigration.  I don't know what the right number is for legal immigration. We naturalize roughly about 1 million people a year. I support legal immigration. I think it makes our country better, but I am not sure exactly what the right number is, and I am not sure exactly what the right formula is. A number of countries, such as Australia and Canada, look at the skills and merit-based system, in addition to family relationships. I think that makes a lot of sense to me.  While we are continuing to have this discussion about what should be the long-term rate of legal immigration, it makes sense to plow these additional green cards--that will not be used prospectively by collateral family members based strictly on that family relationship--back into the backlog and unify the families who have been waiting for their loved one who has been waiting in line, waiting to immigrate legally into the United States.  One thing I really appreciate about the President's proposal is, it addresses shortcomings of the so-called Gang of 8 bill that was considered back in 2013. This is where I differ again from my colleague from Illinois. He celebrates the fact that they were able to get 68 votes in the Senate, but it didn't pass the House, and it never got to the President. I am not sure that is a cause for celebration. What I would actually like to see is us take the President's four pillars and actually get a Presidential signature on a law that passes not only the Senate but the House and that the President will sign. I thought that was the goal, not just to go through some futile gesture or to pass one branch of the legislature only to fail in the House.  The reason the Gang of 8 bill failed in the House was because it had some serious problems. It had no real objective metrics to determine where technology and infrastructure would be the most effective. It didn't allow the Department of Homeland Security to achieve 24/7 situational awareness and 100 percent operational control of the border. It didn't adequately address the personnel and infrastructure improvements we know are desperately needed at our northern borders and our ports of entry.  Finally, even though the Gang of 8 bill contains some provisions to address criminal gangs, drunk drivers, and aggravated felons, it also had generous waivers and still allowed some criminals to qualify for legal status. That didn't make any sense to me then, and it makes no sense to me now. Why would we allow people with criminal records to immigrate into the United States?  Worse, the Gang of 8 bill didn't end catch-and-release of criminal aliens, and it did nothing to deter the influx of people who are exploiting a loophole in the law relating to unaccompanied minors. By way of contrast, the new White House proposal addresses these concerns in ways the flawed Gang of 8 bill did not, and I predict, if we embrace the President's four pillars and pass a bill that reflects those requirements, the House of Representatives could pass it, and the President would sign it, which would actually then provide a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million young people.  I don't know how some of our friends can look these young people in the face and say: We had the chance. You had the opportunity to receive one of the greatest gifts a human being could possibly accept, and that is a pathway to American citizenship, but we turned it down. Perhaps, we miscalculated, and we figured that, maybe, we can get it through the Senate but we can't get it through the House and we can't get a Presidential signature. So we ended up emptyhanded, and you remain in the same box you were in in the first place. How is that helping these young people? It is not.  Well, the White House proposal closes loopholes in the current law that are being exploited by criminal gangs and human traffickers. Let me explain. Under the current law, if somebody is under 18 years of age and shows up at the border, the Border Patrol processes them, and then they are given to Health and Human Services. If they make a claim of some immigration benefit, they are given a notice to appear before an immigration judge, but the backlog there is so great that it could be years down the road, and then they are placed with a sponsor.  Here is the problem. First of all, there is no adequate monitoring of these individuals to make sure they actually show up for their court hearing. Current law allows them to be placed with a sponsor that is not legally present in the country in the first place. There are no criminal background checks. So we don't know whether these unaccompanied children are being placed with people who would abuse them, traffic them, or recruit them into criminal gangs.  In 2017 alone, the Department of Homeland Security apprehended 41,000 unaccompanied minors across the southern border, and 37 percent were between the ages of 15 and 16, and another 32 percent were 17 years old. So we are not talking about young children. We are talking about, by and large, grown young men. As I mentioned earlier, this number has increased significantly, with more than 11,000 unaccompanied minors being apprehended in the last 4 months alone.  They have figured this out. The transnational criminal organizations that traffic in human beings, drugs, weapons, and anything else that is worth a buck have figured this out. They have a loophole in the U.S. law that allows them to charge a fee to[[Page S624]]bring in these young men, who may or may not be a member of MS-13, one of the most violent criminal gangs in Central America. Now they are unfortunately in the United States, and there is no way for the U.S. Government to keep them out even if they are gang members, under current law.  Well, I don't know how our colleagues who refuse to take up this issue and address it justify it. I just can't understand it. In my opinion, we have a real problem that our colleagues either don't want to fix or they are deliberately ignoring. We can't solve these problems by just putting our head in the sand and hoping that the problem goes away. It will not. This is just one example of a loophole, which a border security bill that I introduced months ago, called the Building America's Trust Act, would fix.  So if our colleagues are serious about coming up with a solution to our immigration problems and providing a lifeline to these young adults who are DACA recipients and, indeed, everyone who is DACA-eligible, they need to work with us. They need to recognize the reality that President Trump has laid out a pathway for that to happen, but they can't just cherry-pick and pick the parts they like and ignore the rest and expect that we are going to get an outcome.  Again, the basic failure in the Gang of 8 bill was that they got 68 votes in the Senate, including $50 billion for border security, but they couldn't get it through the House and couldn't get it to the President for signature. I don't know how to sugar-coat it, but that is failure. That is not success. Success is to get a bill through both Houses and to get the President to sign it. President Trump has given all of us a map, a pathway for how to do that. To my knowledge, there has never been a counteroffer that addresses the four pillars that the President has proposed.  Again, I think the people with the most to lose out of this proposition, in addition to the great American people, are these young adults who would benefit from the stability and predictability and a path forward and would receive a gift, as I said, that would be the greatest gift that any human being could possibly aspire to, which is the gift of American citizenship, eventually. But it is going to be squandered. The President's generous offer will be squandered because our colleagues don't like his proposal, but they are unwilling to come up with a counteroffer so that we can actually have a negotiation. The President, I am sure, would welcome that counteroffer, and we would too.  We welcome an opportunity to actually get a result here, to make a law and not just go through a political exercise that is destined to end in failure and then become a political issue in the next election. That is not what we should be about here.  So I hope that reality will set in. President Trump has offered a proposal. Our colleagues on the other side, who don't like the proposal, have not offered a counteroffer that meets the four pillars. They don't even want to pay attention to the last two--the diversity visa issue or the so-called family unification, sometimes called chain migration. They want to act like that doesn't exist, and I just don't get it.  I come from a State of 28 million people, with 38 percent, roughly, of Hispanic origin. We have a 1,200-mile common border with Mexico. Texas taxpayers pay for the border security that the Federal Government fails to fund and facilitate. I want to see a solution. I am happy to vote in favor of a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million people, but I can't go back home and look my constituents in the face unless I tell them that this is the last time we are going to have to do this because we fixed the underlying problem--border insecurity, gaps that are exploited by criminal gang members and the transnational criminal organizations that traffic in them, and these other issues that the President has put on the table.  So I hope reality does set in because I really would like to get a bill that we could pass in the House and the Senate and get to the President for his signature and move on to these other important issues: How do we fund our military? How do we fund the community health centers? How do we provide some predictability to the rest of America that is being held hostage to this issue?  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Young). The Senator from West Virginia.",,

Mr. President, it is now Wednesday morning of the week the Senate set aside to debate DACA, border security, interior enforcement, and other immigration issues. I promised I would clear the way to debate these matters this week, and I have. I promised I would ensure a fair amendment process in which both sides could offer legislation for discussion and votes, and I have. Just yesterday, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus released a letter thanking me for keeping my commitment and urged the Senate to resolve this issue quickly.  But we haven't even been able to get started yet. We haven't even been able to get started. Yesterday, I tried twice to open the debate and start the voting. Both times, my Democratic colleagues objected. I am a little perplexed, frankly, by the holdup.  My Democratic colleagues have spent months--months, as we all know--demanding that the Senate take up this issue. They even shut down the government--shut down the government unnecessarily, I might add--in order to secure this very week for this discussion. But now that the time has come to make law instead of just making points, they are stalling. Why? Why, after months and months spent demanding that the Senate take up this issue, do they now object to even starting the debate? Because they know, no matter how long they spend in closed-door negotiations, they can't change the fact that the President has spelled out a fair and generous framework that will be necessary to earn his signature. These guys can't take yes for an answer. So instead of moving to fulfill our promises and address the DACA issue, they haven't even allowed the debate to begin.  There is a widespread desire in this Chamber to find a resolution for the illegal immigrants who were brought to this country as children--widespread agreement on that--but common sense dictates that we cannot simply treat one symptom of our broken immigration policy in complete isolation. We must address the underlying problems as well. That means fixing broken parts of our legal immigration system.  We must also ensure the safety of the American people. That is why a DACA resolution should be paired with new security measures at our borders and commonsense steps to improve security inside our borders, steps like fixing the loophole that forces us to release thousands of criminal aliens whose home countries won't take them back, steps like enacting Kate's Law to put criminal offenders who repeatedly and illegally cross our borders behind bars, cracking down with stiffer penalties for human trafficking, and updating the removability grounds for drug traffickers, repeat drunk drivers, gang members, sex offenders, and other violent and dangerous criminals. Why in the world would those ideas be controversial?  Keeping Americans safe does not need to be a partisan issue, and addressing these important safety issues along with DACA, border security, and[[Page S930]]other parts of our broken immigration system is our best chance to produce legislation that can pass the House, pass the Senate, and earn the President's signature. This is why the proposal put forward by Senator Grassley and others, which draws on the President's generous framework and which the President has officially endorsed, has my support, because presumably we will actually make a law here.  I have made no effort--none--to tell Democrats what amendments they should offer. Of course, they shouldn't try to dictate Republican amendments either.  The longer my colleagues across the aisle refuse to come to the table, the longer they are unable to produce any legislation they actually support, the lower the odds that we can arrive at a legislative solution this week.  Yesterday alone, the Senate was open for 9 hours--yesterday alone, 9 hours. Nine hours we could have spent processing amendments and proceeding to votes. Nine hours down the drain because Democrats won't let us start the debate they have spent months demanding.  Now that we can finally proceed to consider the underlying bill this morning, I hope my colleagues across the aisle will come to the table. The President has made clear what principles must be addressed if we are going to make a law instead of merely making political points.  While our Democratic colleagues can no longer prevent the Senate from starting the debate, they can continue to delay votes on amendments. I hope that won't happen.",,

Now on another matter, Mr. President, as I have repeatedly stated, now that there is an agreement on long-term government funding, the Senate will proceed to a fair debate over the DACA issue, border security, and other matters pertaining to the subject of immigration. This process begins in just a few hours. We will vote to proceed to an unrelated, neutral House-passed bill that will serve as the vehicle for any legislation that succeeds here in the Senate. As I have repeated many times, I will ensure that a fair amendment process gives Senators the opportunity to submit proposals for consideration and votes. I hope this body can seize this opportunity and deliver real progress toward securing our border, reforming aspects of our immigration policy, and achieving a resolution for individuals who were brought to our country illegally when they were young.  The American people have heard no shortage of rhetoric on this issue. They have heard many of my colleagues across the aisle insist that this issue requires swift action. Now is the time to back up this talk with the hard work of finding a workable solution. That means finding an agreement which can pass the Senate, pass the[[Page S856]]House, and which the President will sign--not just making a point.  A number of my colleagues--Senators Grassley, Cornyn, Tillis, Perdue, Lankford, Cotton, and Ernst--will introduce a balanced proposal that tries to meet these requirements. I support the President's proposal and my colleagues' legislation to implement it.  The Secure and Succeed Act is fair and addresses both sides' most pressing concerns, conforming to the conditions the President has put forward. It offers a compassionate resolution for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as children. In exchange, this solution delivers funding for President Trump's promise to fully secure the border, reforms our approach to extended family chain migration, and reallocates our arbitrary visa lottery into a more sensible, merit-based system.  This legislation is a fair compromise that addresses the stated priorities of all sides. It is our best chance of producing a solution that can actually resolve these matters, which requires that a bill pass the Senate, pass the House, and earn the President's signature. It has my support.  The time for political posturing is behind us. Now we have an opportunity to resolve these issues. I hope we make the most of it.",,

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, when we left Washington before the Presidents Day recess, we watched our colleagues in the Senate vote on a series of bills to address immigration. Only one bill received 60 votes, but it was 60 votes against the bill offered by Senator Grassley, the bill that most closely matches the President's hatred for immigrants.  So a supermajority in the Senate opposes the President's plan for massive cuts to legal immigration and massive deportations.                              {time}  1015  Then, yesterday, President Trump's campaign against immigrants received another blow. The Supreme Court declined to take a case from California[[Page H1271]]and declined to lift an injunction requiring the Department of Homeland Security to continue to process renewals for the DACA program, which means that those who signed up for DACA over the past 5 years can renew their DACA now, and the arbitrary deadline the President set for kicking 1,000 people per day out of the program beginning next Monday has, like so much of what Trump does, been stopped for now.  Just take a moment to appreciate what happened. The Attorney General and the President, without offering any evidence, told the American people that they had to end the DACA program because it was illegal and the courts would strike it down, they said.  As it turns out, the truth is almost the exact opposite of what the President and the Attorney General have told the country. No court has ever found DACA illegal or even legally suspect. Their actions to kill the DACA program have been found highly questionable by the courts.  But let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, just because the courts have taken no action and the Senate failed to take action does not mean that the House and Republicans are off the hook for DACA. The President still plans to kill DACA and make hundreds of thousands of immigrants, who are currently documented and known to our government, into undocumented immigrants forced underground--vulnerable, exploitable, and deportable.  The House has an opportunity--indeed, a responsibility--to step up to the occasion and craft a permanent solution. The good news is that the solution is supported by 8 out of 10 voters in the United States: a pathway to citizenship.  Can we, as a body, rise to the occasion to do something Americans want us to do? Can we set aside questions of who wins and who loses politically long enough to do what is right? We won't know unless we try.  Many on the other side say there should be only one option: leave or be deported, but that is not what we do to American children. And let's be clear, these are American children. We do not force American children to live in exile for 10, 20, 30 years. We do not educate and acculturate our youth and then force them out of the country.  If you are an American patriot, the last thing you want is for the world to see us deporting our own Americans. Just ask your donors, the Koch brothers, who know that saving the Dreamers is what they call something demanded as patriots.  So, Mr. Speaker, the ball is in our court. We need to take action now. If we can draft a compromise to protect Dreamers and allow them to live in their home country, America, if both sides concede something to the other, we may get to a solution. That is what leaders must do. A compromise will likely be painful for all. We need to show the country that we are willing to take the heat and that we are ready to legislate.  The President set us on this course. He pulled the legal rug from underneath the Dreamers and then cloaked his position on immigration in an ethnocentric, pro-European, pro-White agenda that will hurt America.  But the racists--and we must call them out for what they are--the racists who are driving immigration policy in the White House are defining the agenda for every House Republican and are shaping the brand of the Republican Party not just as the party opposed to illegal immigration, but, now, as the party opposed to legal immigration; not just as the party who doesn't want poor or Latin American immigrants, but doesn't want Brown or Black or anyone who isn't White in this country. If that is how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle define themselves and want to be remembered, then they should do nothing.  But I have a greater faith in this institution and in the ability of this Congress to rise above racism and to do something the American people want us to do without regard to race, religion, or national origin. I am a Democrat who will work with Republicans if Republicans are serious about reaching a solution, but it must start with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle saying: ``Yes, we want to solve the problem, and we want to rise above the racism emanating from the White House today.''  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) for 5 minutes.  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, June is Immigrant Heritage Month, and as the son of parents who fled Castro's Cuba, like so many other residents of south Florida, I am especially proud of my district's rich immigrant history and culture. From small-business owners to law enforcement, hundreds of thousands of immigrants and their descendants across south Florida are contributing to our economy, culture, and local communities as living examples of American success.  I know from firsthand experience the great and generous spirit of the American people and the unimaginable opportunities our Nation provides to all who are willing to work for them.  Despite the longstanding tradition of welcoming immigrants to our shores, our Nation continues to have vigorous debate about immigration policy. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the current debate has left thousands of immigrant children, who were brought to this country by their parents, in constant fear of deportation to countries of origin many of them don't even remember.  They have attended school with our own children, graduated high school, sometimes even serving in the military, and today are seeking to contribute to American society and help grow our economy.  Mr. Speaker, the President, the former President, and Members of Congress in both Chambers and from both parties agree that these young people, commonly referred to as DREAMers, should be treated with compassion.  I too agree, which is why I introduced legislation that would give these young people the certainty that they deserve. The Recognizing America's Children Act creates three pathways to legal status for them: academic, military service, or employment. All qualified applicants would be thoroughly vetted, and any individual who has been involved in serious criminal conduct will be disqualified.  Mr. Speaker, immigration reform means strengthening security at our border and modernizing our visa program to keep Americans safe, but it also means offering immigrants who love our country just as much as we do the opportunity to fully participate in the American experience. It is my hope that this Immigrant Heritage Month will lead us to act in this regard.              Mental Health Awareness Semipostal Stamp Act  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, neurological and psychiatric disorders have exacted a tremendous toll on our society. Despite the great scientific strides being made daily in neuroscience research, the underlying causes of conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, depression, and traumatic brain injury remain unsolved. For true breakthroughs to occur, researchers require additional data to better treat these conditions.  To address this, the previous administration announced the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies Initiative in 2013. Known as the BRAIN Initiative, this collaborative public-private research will advance our understanding of how the brain functions as researchers work to map the brain and study how individual cells interact in both time and space.  The data generated from this research will help scientists fill in the gaps in our current understanding and provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring how the brain enables us to record, process, utilize, store, and retrieve vast quantities of information. This information will also provide researchers with a better understanding of mental illness and posttraumatic stress disorder in hopes of better treating these diseases and reducing the number of suicides each year.  I was pleased that the 21st Century Cures Act, which I supported here in the House and was signed into law, authorized $1.51 billion for this important research.  Mr. Speaker, to help accelerate this project and raise public attention to this initiative, today I introduced the Mental Health Awareness Semipostal Stamp Act with Representative Grace Napolitano to raise awareness for this important cause. This would come at no cost to taxpayers.  Revenues generated from the sale of a specialized postage stamp would be directed to the National Institute of Mental Health to further this ambitious program that has the potential to revolutionize neurological and psychiatric care all around the world.",,

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, ``This is a new era. This is the Trump era.'' Mr. Speaker, those were the words of the Attorney General, the former Senator from Alabama.  The Attorney General has launched a campaign to paint immigrants as criminals, rapists, gang members, and ``cartel henchmen.'' In his prepared remarks at the border a couple of weeks ago, the Attorney General planned to say the following: ``It is here, on this sliver of land, where we first take our stand against this filth.''  When he gave the speech he edited out the words ``this filth'' because, I guess, calling immigrants from Latin America ``filth'' was even too extreme for this Attorney General. But it remains on the DOJ website. In fact, as far as the Attorney General is concerned, any immigrant who is here illegally is a criminal.  He has ordered the government to prosecute immigration violations, even minor ones, to the full extent of the law and to make prosecution of immigrants a top priority--on par with murder, drugs, counterfeiting, and kidnapping.  He has ordered every one of the 94 U.S. Attorney Offices to appoint a special prosecuting attorney so that immigrants are considered public enemy number one, nationwide--not drug dealers, immigrants. According to the latest Federal data, 46 percent of all new Federal criminal prosecution is immigration related--not narcotics. The second highest crime prosecuted accounts only for 14 percent of new Federal cases. In the new Trump era, a felony prosecution against an immigrant who has been living and working here peacefully for decades is three times important than a felony prosecution of a drug dealer.  And that imbalance is not enough for the Attorney General. He wants to prosecute immigrants beyond the full extent of the law by turning misdemeanors into felonies, and turning felonies into aggravated felonies. They think it will not look so ugly when the U.S. is deporting moms and dads who have raised successful families--or deporting children who grew up in the U.S. from the time they were toddlers--if the Attorney General and his team can look and tell the American people they were just thugs, gangbangers, and rapists.  Jeff Sessions and Donald Trump want more immigrants criminalized, felonized, and deported. Yes, we are truly in the Trump era.[[Page H2904]]  But let's be frank. This is not a surprise when Donald Trump descended the gold escalator and announced his candidacy for President. Almost the first words out of his mouth were Mexicans are rapists, murderers, drug dealers, and immigration is turning America into a war zone.  When he was a Senator from Alabama, the Attorney General made a career of associating immigrants with crime and doing his best to defeat reforms that would strengthen legal immigration and reduce illegal immigration. Deportation, criminalization, and restricting legal immigration were the bedrock of this Attorney General's approach when he was a U.S. Senator.  Our legal immigration system already works fine according to both Senator and Attorney General Sessions, no matter that some people who are receiving their visas today applied for them when Bill Clinton was President and that those applying for visas today will probably get them when Chelsea Clinton is President of the United States.  Mr. Speaker, when your constituents say, ``Hey, why don't those immigrants come here legally?'' or, ``Why don't they just go back and come back legally?'' the answer is clear: as a Senator, our Attorney General made sure that that was impossible.  Next week, millions of Americans will take to the streets to demonstrate against mass deportation, the border wall, prison beds, and drive-by deportations. But it is not because we are soft on crime or love immigrants more than the people who were born here. No. We have a different vision of what the United States is and should always be.  We are not an incarceration nation, a nation hostile to other countries and their people. We are a great nation, a nation that, in her greatness, is a beacon of hope to refugees, a land of opportunity for entrepreneurs, and a democracy with separate branches of government that act as effective checks and balances on unlimited power.  The American people are sensible, fair, and pragmatic, and are correct when they reject the idea that a wall makes sense in the 21st century as the centerpiece of our immigration policy. We are not persuaded by the poetry of the Attorney General when he stands at the border and says: ``It is here, on this sliver of land, where we first take our stand against this filth.'' No, we think of another, better poem, the one at the Statue of Liberty, the lady with her torch in the harbor, who shares our deeply held values as Americans and says every day to the entire world at that harbor: ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.''",,
Democrat,https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2018/3/7/house-section/article/h1446-1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22immigration%22%5D%7D&r=26,"BLOCKING IMMIGRATION LEGISLATION  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I talked about immigrants Donald Trump doesn't really care for, like the Dreamers who were raised in the United States and are now vulnerable to deportation. Then there are the refugees from war and religious persecution. He doesn't really care for them either.  Let's see, there are the people from El Salvador, Haiti, or Africa--the people from shithole countries. Trump would rather deport than protect them. And he doesn't want them coming here legally either.  No, as we all know by now, Trump prefers immigrants from snowhole countries like Norway. Yep, you take a look at the Winter Olympics leaderboard of the countries that won medals and that is a pretty good list of who Trump wants to have here. Norway, check. Canada, great. Netherlands, okay. And we better add Russia to that, too.  President Trump has been blocking any kind of immigrant legislation because he will only agree to protect Dreamers from deportation if he can eliminate whole categories of legal immigration. And not just any immigration, but specifically the programs that are filled with people who want to come to the United States legally from Asia, Africa, and Latin America.  He is especially opposed to diversity in our immigration system, and among the programs he insists we eliminate is the one most often used by immigrants from Africa.  So Trump's immigration approach is pretty simple: If you are White, you are all right. If you are Brown, you are a little lower down. And if you are Black, just go back.  The other group of people Trump is particularly angry about are family members of U.S. citizens--yes--and those who are on the path to becoming U.S. citizens. He insists that we need to take away the rights of U.S. citizens to petition for their family members. Nope, Trump thinks U.S. citizens cannot be trusted to petition for their own family members, which is kind of strange because he doesn't have to look very far to find an immigrant American citizen who petitioned--legally--for Melania's parents to come to the United States.  According to The Washington Post:  ``The parents of First Lady Melania Trump have become legal permanent residents of the United States and are close to obtaining their citizenship, according to people familiar with their status. . . .  ``Immigration experts said''--they--``very likely relied on a family reunification process that President Trump has derided as `chain migration' and proposed ending in such cases.''  Remember, the in-laws are from Slovenia, and that country won two medals at the Winter Olympics, so I guess they are okay. It is okay, apparently.  Now, let us remember that the First Lady of the United States is here in this country because she applied for, and received, an ``extraordinary ability visa,'' which is often called the Einstein visa because we give it to Nobel Prize winners. But I guess we also give the Einstein visa to musicians and artists and runway models.  The First Lady's extraordinary abilities are many, I am sure. Now, I want you to recall that one of the issues in Jared Kushner's security clearance was that he owes so much money to foreigners, that some people might be able to leverage that debt into an application for another visa program just for millionaires and fat cats. Yes, in America, if you have $1 million, or you look like $1 million, you can get a visa. But if you look like a parking attendant or a busboy or a field hand or the king of Wakanda, in the eyes of our President, you are just not welcome in the United States of America.  Look, let me break it down from my perspective. This is not the country we aspire to be. My mother came from Puerto Rico with a fifth grade education, and Puerto Rico has never won a gold medal at the Winter Olympics. But guess what? Her daughter--my sister--is a great public school teacher and her son is a Member of Congress, and I think that is what the American story should always be about. Not special treatment, not special programs just for the rich and the beautiful, and not, apparently, fast-tracking for the President's family, especially when he is going after so many other people's families who look just like mine.  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in profanity in debate.  Members are reminded to refrain from engaging in personalities toward the President.",,
Republican,https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2018/2/15/house-section/article/h1204-1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22immigration%22%5D%7D&r=27,"IMMIGRATION REFORM  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of January 3, 2017, the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Garrett) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.  Mr. GARRETT. Madam Speaker, it is a somber time to come into this Chamber as we have colleagues at the other end of the building who formed something they call the Common Sense Coalition, which is, I think, a gentle euphemism like so many things in this town are, which might well be called the ``kick the can down the road'' coalition, the ``doing the same thing again and again and again and again and expecting a different result'' coalition, or the ``those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it'' coalition.  The photo that is to my left and to your right if you are viewing at home is of me at a ceremony at Red Hill Farm in the Fifth District of Virginia, where a man named Patrick Henry lived.  Patrick Henry is notable as an early patriot who sought to ensure the blessings of self-determination and liberty for a fledgling nation that determined that it was unjust that they should be governed by edict from across the sea and most notably said the words: ``I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.''  Indeed, anyone who signed the Declaration of Independence understood at that time that they were literally signing their own death warrant, yet they did because it was the right thing to do.  Today we have degenerated into a political class that knows pandering and efforts to placate individuals without the interests of the mass constituency that we all unitedly serve, and that is the American people.  In fact, when Patrick Henry spoke about liberty one day in a separate speech, from the back of the room, someone shouted, ``Treason,'' and Henry responded eloquently: ``If this be treason, make the most of it.''  What has happened to our leaders?  So that day I spoke to a group of a couple of dozen new Americans from every corner of the world--from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and South America--who had, in some instances, worked decades to become Americans and to earn those blessings of liberty gained for us by people like Patrick Henry, like 1 million nameless faces who died of combat death, disease, or starvation during a war to end the horrific institution of slavery, and like Abraham Lincoln and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  So they, indeed, looked like America--Brown people, White people, Black people, Asian people, American people--and they earned it. But what is coming out of the Senate now essentially throws aside the sacrifices of so many in order to score political points.  It was, indeed, one of the greatest honors of my life to welcome those new brothers and sisters to our American family. Yet the process through which they pained and labored does not in any way mirror the process that we would continue by kicking the can down the road under the proposed Senate ``compromise.''  I could really, literally, do this all day, all week, all month, and all year if I wanted to highlight the cases of individuals who had lost their lives because our Federal Government is completely unwilling to enforce the laws that it currently has on the books.                              {time}  1245  Many of you recognize the lovely face of Kate Steinle, who was enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the Embarcadero district of San Francisco on pier 14 with her dad. A graduate of Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, she worked in the medical field and had recently moved in with her boyfriend when an illegal who had been deported 5 times, who the local government refused to turn over to Federal authorities, discharged a weapon that he stole from a member of law enforcement at what he said was a sea lion--which is bad enough--and killed this lovely young woman whom her friends say loved yoga and helping others.  Reports indicate that among her last words was a plea to her father to please help. She passed away because we refuse to enforce our law.  Edwin Jackson, a linebacker for the Indianapolis Colts, was born in the same town that I was: Atlanta, Georgia. He didn't have big-time football offers out of high school. Indeed, instead of the University of Georgia or Florida or Clemson, he matriculated to Georgia Southern University. But he worked, and he worked with an optimism that radiated from the very smile on his face.[[Page H1205]]  And not long ago, Edwin Jackson became one of nearly 1,000 people per year who die in alcohol-related accidents involving people in this country illegally; as well as his Uber driver, Jeffrey Monroe, who should also be noted. Edwin Jackson's obituary indicated that his greatest goal in life was to be a positive role model for young people to overcome challenges.  The individual who was detained had a blood alcohol content of .239, or nearly three times the legal limit. He had been deported twice before, tried to run from the scene, and lied to police officers about his name upon his apprehension.  Edwin Jackson and Jeffrey Monroe are dead because we refuse to enforce our laws.  Denise Mosier, in my home State of Virginia, in 2010, was riding in a van with two other nuns from the 33-women monastery where she made her home, aspiring to help people. Her two dear friends were horrifically injured in an accident that took Miss Mosier's life. This Benedictine nun had devoted her life to the service of others. Quite literally, you could find nothing bad that anyone could say about this woman.  The driver who took her life was ultimately charged with DUI third or subsequent offense. He had arrived illegally in this country and was only weeks away from a deportation hearing, which he was only having because of his multiple prior arrests for driving under the influence.  Tragically, our unwillingness to enforce our own laws cost about 10 percent of the community at the monastery where Denise Mosier made her home dearly and cost about 4 percent their life.  In fact, 13 percent of all drunk drivers arrested in the United States every year are here illegally--13 percent of 1.5 million. And the death toll of drunk-driving-related offenses in this country is about 10,000 per year. So extrapolating those numbers, nearly 1,000 people per year are killed in alcohol-related accidents involving those here illegally. And we refuse to enforce our own laws.  Peter Hacking was a volunteer fire department captain in Texas. One afternoon not long ago, Peter stopped off Highway 78 to pick up his children, which included 4-year-old Ellie and a son who was 2, when they were killed by a previously deported drunk driver, who ultimately received a sentence of about 2 years, and who was here because we will not secure our border and we will not enforce our laws.  Let me be clear: those two dozen or so individuals whom I had the great honor--of all faiths and all creeds from around the world--of welcoming into our American family are American just like everyone watching this today. But those who are not here legally, who will not go through the processes prescribed by this very body, are a discredit to those who work so hard and those who have sacrificed so much to make this Nation the beacon of freedom that it is. And no nation of laws can perpetuate itself so long as it looks the other way as its laws are selectively enforced and not enforced.  Tessa Tranchant, from Virginia Beach, Virginia, was riding with a girlfriend and killed by a drunk driver here illegally.  Danny Oliver and Michael Davis were law enforcement professionals from Sacramento, California. They were murdered by a frequently deported individual who swears that he will find a way to kill more police officers.  Dominic Durden was killed while riding his motorcycle by an illegal drunk driver.  Jamiel Shaw was brutally shot and murdered by an illegal.  Marilyn Pharis, who devoted her life to the service of this Nation in the United States Air Force, was beaten, tortured, raped, and murdered by an illegal who had been arrested 6 times in 15 months, the most recent time being 8 days before this crime was perpetrated but not reported to Federal authorities because the sanctuary community that she was in did not deem it worthy to report.  I want to see a healthy and robust immigration system into this country, legally. I want to live in a nation that enforces the very laws that these bodies pass to protect those people who we are tasked with serving, the American people, be they naturalized or native born.  I literally could keep telling these stories for weeks and weeks and weeks.  So we now find fiscal responsibility a rallying cry from individuals who don't seem to care about that at any point in time except for when it is convenient to their political agenda. We have a President in the White House who suggested that we would build a border wall and we would have those who are responsible for the immigration problem pay for it. We have a media that glowingly and gleefully pokes fun and asks: How is that plan going for you?  Well, I have a proposal. About 92 percent of foreign nationals in U.S. Federal prisons are here illegally. That is over 9 out of 10. That comes out to about 34,500 inmates in our Federal prison system here illegally. And they are not here for immigration violations. They are here for robbery; they are here for rape; they are here for murder.  The cost to incarcerate one individual in the Federal prison system annually is about $32,500. I'm not that good at math, but that comes out to about $1.1 billion per year. If you move away from the Federal prison system and extrapolate those numbers across the State prison systems, you are looking at something like $9.5 billion per year to incarcerate illegals here convicted of violent crimes, felonies. We are talking about prisons, not jails.  Now, the Senate plan says: Okay. Well, what we are going to do is we are going to spend $18 billion over 10 years.  I will tell you what. If we can just secure the Southern border and stop the inflow of illegals, we could reduce our Federal and State prison expenditures by about $9.5 billion a year, and I'll get you your $18 billion in 2 years.  In other words, you want to pay for this wall?  Build it; it will pay for itself. And that is in dollars and cents.  But, folks, how do you quantify the lives of these people?  How do you put a dollar value on the life of a woman who spent her entire life serving our country and was tortured, raped, and murdered by someone who had been arrested just 6 days before and, under the Federal law, should have been reported to Federal authorities, but they didn't think it was necessary in California?  Or Jamiel, is there a dollar value you can put on this young man's life?  How do you quantify these lives? How about these law enforcement professionals? How about this teenage girl from Virginia Beach, Virginia? How about a firefighter and father of a 22-month-old and a 4-year-old? How about a nun who devoted her entire life to serving others? How about a football player who worked his way up from the bottom and only wanted to motivate and inspire young people who faced challenging circumstances?  I genuinely love my brothers and sisters of all races, creeds, and origins; I genuinely do. I welcome them to apply to a process to allow them to avail themselves of the benefits of, I believe, the greatest Nation the Earth has ever seen. Winston Churchill said: ``Democracy was the worst form of government, except for all the others.'' This is the worst country in the world, except for all the others.  But if we won't enforce the laws that we pass, who are we? What have we become? And if we won't protect those people who protect us--firefighters, police officers, nuns, and mothers--how can we look at ourselves?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Budd).  Mr. BUDD. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague from Virginia for yielding. I really thank him for his leadership on this issue.  The last time I spoke on this floor on immigration, I talked about three principles: One, Americans have the right to determine who becomes citizens through laws; two, the people who do come here should be in the best interest of American citizens; and three, that we have the right to enforce those choices.  The people who do come here should be in the best interest of American citizens. That is key. What we are doing now isn't there yet. We allow, today, one individual to get a green card. Then he is able to sponsor his immediate family and relatives. And then the relatives can sponsor their relatives. Then the relatives of those relatives can sponsor their relatives and so on, until there is no one in the family left to sponsor or no one left who[[Page H1206]]even wants to come to the United States.  Potentially, this could go on forever. This is called chain migration, and 65 percent of our green cards are awarded through this chain migration. That is about 700,000 people every year gaining permanent residence in our country through no other criteria than that they happen to be related to someone who lives here.  We have no idea whether these individuals are going to be economically successful. We have no idea whether they will contribute to our country. We don't even look at those characteristics for chain migration. The important question is who the immigrant is related to, not whether or not he might help America be a safer or a more prosperous country. Chain migration does not meet that key principle. American immigration should be in the best interest of Americans.  The Securing America's Future Act ends this chain migration. It stops it for everyone except the children and spouses of immigrants. But those relatives cannot bring in additional immigrants, so the chain is broken. The Securing America's Future Act, in turn, replaces those immigrants with skilled workers, workers who could help us build a better future.  I think about it this way: there are 150 million people around the world who would say that they would emigrate to the United States if they were just given the opportunity. What a great country. We could do what we do now and let those people enter on the basis of who they are related to. That is what we are doing. Or we could let in the best engineers, doctors, nurses, teachers, and businessmen. We can let in those who could speak English well, who know our system of government, who have gone to university. But that can only happen if we end chain migration.  The chain migration proposal in the Securing America's Future Act becomes even more crucial when we look at the DACA issue. If we allow DACA recipients to get some form of residency, past history tells us that they will potentially sponsor around 3\1/2\ immigrants each. That is a 2- to 3-million-person increase in the immigrant population. That is a huge incentive for future immigrants to come here illegally.                              {time}  1300  The notion that you will get to bring your whole family over here if you manage to enter illegally is part of what led to the 2013-2014 border crisis. When the previous administration was rumored to be granting amnesty, tens of thousands of Latin American families sent their minor children north.  It was a national emergency, and it overwhelmed the Border Patrol and the immigrant processing facilities there in the Southwest. We had to pass emergency appropriations just to process these individuals. Any DACA fix that does not also include additional border security and protections against those migrating this way, they could really see a similar crisis.  Madam Speaker, the Securing America's Future Act is an incredible piece of legislation. And while I have dwelt on its chain migration provisions--and there are many more worthy reforms--this bill cracks down on sanctuary cities, which my colleague mentioned earlier. It includes Kate's Law to toughen penalties against those who are deported, come back to the United States, and commit crimes. It includes mandatory E-Verify to crack down on businesses that break the law. It ends the diversity visa lottery, one of the most senseless Federal policies that I can think of.  I thank Chairman Goodlatte for his efforts on this; I thank Representative Labrador, one of our staunchest conservative leaders in the House, for his leadership in crafting this bill; and I thank Representative Garrett for organizing this opportunity to discuss the bill.  Mr. GARRETT. Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Budd for his comments.  At this time, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Florida, (Mr. Yoho).  Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my good colleague from Virginia (Mr. Garrett) and everybody else who has participated in this important topic.  For far too long, Washington has allowed our broken immigration system to fester. Since 1986, when safeguards were put in place to protect our Nation from illegal immigration, we have seen the rule of law not followed, and it has led to the situation we have today. This is not an overnight sensation that just has happened.  If you look at the number one role of government, it is to provide for the common defense of our Nation and the security of our Nation. Madam Speaker, you cannot have a secure nation if you don't have secure borders. That is one of the reasons we lock our car doors. That is one of the reasons we lock our house doors is to secure our family.  Well, the government's role is to secure their Nation and the people within it so that we can have a secure nation, the peace of mind that our families are protected from people that shouldn't be here in the first place. We need to reform our system so that we have legal immigration that is not burdensome to the point where it doesn't work, and that is what Washington has been well known for. We need to seek real reforms that cut down on illegal immigration while protecting and bolstering the legal immigration system.  Our Nation is a nation of immigrants, and Theodore Roosevelt addressed this, I think, very succinctly in 1907 in a speech when he talked about our land being a land of immigrants, how we have come over from other countries from around the world. But he also went on to say and talk about the values of America, that we, being a land of immigrants, understand this: There is but room for one flag. It is the American flag. You need to honor it. There is room but for one language. It is English. You need to learn it.  Immigration without assimilation is an invasion, and that is really what we have, an invasion, because we don't know who is here. We don't know where they came from.  And Dreamers who were brought here to this country, I think we are all sympathetic. They were brought here to this country at no fault of their own and registered with DHS under DACA. There is a program where they could have registered. They are a different class, but they can be handled in a systematic manner, whether it starts off with probationary periods, running background checks, ensuring all fines are paid for outstanding traffic tickets or other, among other things. And I stand with and I am a cosponsor of the Goodlatte-Labrador bill. I think it is a great start. As immigration policies or as policies up here in Washington, we know they change over time, and so I think this is a good start.  We need to strengthen our border--that needs to be paramount--and tighten our borders through what the Customs and Border Patrol tell us to do.  You know, there are people who want to build a wall from sea to shining sea. I think we should build a wall where the experts say we need to build a wall and do other forms of security, but the bottom line is we have to have a secure border. And it is not just our southwest border; it is all of our borders. And I think every American should be concerned about this, and you would think they would want this.  We also should allow Customs and Border Patrol to survey and make recommendations for how they think best we can increase the security of, again, not just our southern border but, again, all the borders.  Sanctuary cities who openly defy Federal immigration law place American citizens at risk, and I would hope the people in those cities, the citizens of those cities, would rise up and hold their elected officials accountable so that it is not a political platform that a party wants to promote. All you have to do is look at the many people who have been killed by people here illegally, and they rush for the protection of a sanctuary city.  And these are cities, again, that are breaking the Federal law. They defy Federal law without consequence. Congress does have the power to hold these people accountable, these States. And, again, it will be the citizens of those cities, hopefully, who will rise up and say enough is enough.  The Goodlatte-Labrador bill, H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act, I cosponsored because it lays out a plan to address many of the immigration reform priorities: It eliminates the diversity visa, which is just a happenstance. If you are the lucky one[[Page H1207]]who pulls the right number, you get the lottery ticket, and the lottery ticket is coming here to America. It eliminates the diversity visa to increase the number of skilled worker visas. It creates a new agriculture guest worker program.  And I am proud because some of the recommendations we have are in that bill, and so we want to see that pass. This is one of the things that has to happen.  But before we can go forward, we have to make sure that the borders are secured, that the rule of law is enforced, and that we have a good guest worker program. It also requires employers to utilize the E-Verify system to ensure their employees are legally able to work in this country.  The good thing about the E-Verify system, it also gives protection to the employer, knowing that they went through the process that the government says they must go through and they have hired people that the government says are okay. So it gives protection not just to our employers, but it gives protection to the people here, who come here for the privilege of coming to America to work.  It invests in a new security measure for our borders, gives registered DACA recipients a renewable 3-year legal status, while ensuring individuals who could cause harm are not eligible for it. It withholds grants and Federal funding from sanctuary cities and gets rid of the chain migration.  So this, I think, is a very strong bill. I think it is a very good bill, that it accomplishes the goal. It could always be better. It is not comprehensive immigration reform, but it is a great start.  You know, working in the agricultural sector for 35 years of my life as a veterinarian working on the farms, I talked to a lot of the immigrants, and a lot of the immigrants that I talked to were here illegally. And I asked them: Do you want to be a citizen of the United States?  They said: No. The majority of them didn't. They wanted the opportunity--the opportunity--to come here to make some money to go back home, and I think we should accommodate that.  And then if you talk to other immigrants who are here and they migrated here legally, I asked them: Why did you come here? Why did your parents come here?  And do you know what it always comes down to? They wanted opportunity, and they wanted security, and they wanted a better life for their family.  So our broken system does not accomplish that, and it is time to fix the broken system, and this is the time to do it.  With that, I thank the gentleman for bringing up this great topic, this passionate topic, and with your work, your help, we can accomplish this.  Mr. GARRETT. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), my friend and colleague, for his comments.  In 42 years, 3,037 Americans have been killed on U.S. soil by foreign-born terrorists. There have been 182 foreign-born terrorists, to be precise, who have taken the lives of almost 3,050 Americans, and 63 of those 182, or greater than a third, came here legally on visas, to include the diversity visa scheme. In fact, our office has tried relatively diligently to calculate the actual death toll of native-born Americans by recipients of diversity visas, unsuccessfully. These are difficult data points.  But just in the last few years, the name Sayfullo Saipov has been in the American news. This jihadist who had an admiration for terrorists, to include the murderous raping, intolerant thugs of ISIS, took the lives of eight Americans and injured many more in a truck attack on Halloween, just last October. He was the recipient of a diversity lottery visa.  Before that, Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev from Uzbekistan was also the recipient of a diversity lottery visa, and he was arrested in 2015 for conspiring to ``kill as many Americans as he could.'' He wrote:       I am in the USA now. We don't have the weapons we need. Is      it possible to commit ourselves as dedicated martyrs anyway      while here? What I am saying is, to get guns, to shoot Obama,      and then maybe get shot ourselves. Would that do? That would      strike fear into the hearts of the infidels.  This legal diversity visa recipient from Brooklyn said:       If this is not successful, maybe bomb Coney Island.  Fortunately, he was arrested before he could bring to fruition his plans to assault individuals in the very Nation that had so graciously opened its doors.  It is incredibly interesting to me the results that I learned when my wife and I engaged in that which is all the rage these days and looked at our DNA. I found out I had relatives from multiple continents, and I am proud of that. But I am an American just like those people who stood with me that day at the home of the great American patriot Patrick Henry, from Africa and Asia, the Middle East, South America, Europe, Oceania. They are my American brothers and sisters. They did everything by the numbers and availed themselves of a dream that we all share. Those who do not, cheapen the sacrifice made by so many who have come before them.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.",,

Mr. Speaker, today I want to address illegal immigration and what House Republicans are doing to ensure Americans' safety. This week, we voted to defund sanctuary cities that harbor criminals like the man who murdered Kate Steinle in San Francisco.  My heart goes out to her parents and families around the country who have lost loved ones to foreign nationals who should have never been in this country in the first place.  We passed Kate's Law to increase penalties on previously deported illegal immigrants. Also, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act would defund sanctuary cities and prevent lawsuits against local governments that follow Federal law.  Shockingly, Nashville, in my home State of Tennessee, has been considering a sanctuary bill, even though murders this year already outnumber last year's total.  Some on the city council want Nashville to become a magnet for violent gangs that transport drugs and human beings. Sanctuary policies endanger not only San Francisco or Nashville but the entire U.S.  President Trump is cracking down on immigration crime. Illegal border crossings are down, and arrests and deportations of criminal aliens are up, just as Americans demanded last November.  Here in the House, we are keeping our promises and our country safe.",,

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the cruel immigration proposal unveiled by the White House this week. This proposal goes beyond some of the worst immigration bills. It demands billions more for border security, tightens asylum standards, cuts off legal immigration, and implements a faulty points-based system, undercutting our core values as a country and destroying our economy and our future.  Mr. Speaker, two-thirds of all immigrants to the United States are women and children, and these policies will disproportionately hurt them. A points-based system eliminates family-based immigration, and it is insulting to the valuable contributions of women, especially.  Nearly 70 percent of all women immigrants with legal status obtained it through the family system, and many are stuck in visa backlogs waiting years and even decades to reunite with their families.  Mr. Speaker, immigration has never been just about immigration. It has always been about who we are as a country and what we are willing to stand up for. I believe the majority of my Republican colleagues want to pass the Dream Act, and I ask them to join us in rejecting these anti-immigrant poison pills and proposing real solutions that benefit the American people and unify our country.",,

Mr. Speaker, a recent poll of Texas voters shows that they want to reduce and reform legal immigration and save jobs for Americans.  The Pulse Opinion Research survey found that 63 percent of Texans favor less immigration than the current annual level of 1 million. Notably, 56 percent support cutting the number of green cards by at least half. Only 14 percent of the voters questioned want to increase immigration.  The poll also determined that Texas voters, by a 2-1 margin, want to end chain migration and only admit spouses and minor children of immigrants. Also, respondents strongly support workforce verification to prevent illegal immigrants from taking jobs away from citizens.  Congress should listen to Texans' views on immigration policy. With a 2,000-mile common border with Mexico, Texas continues to bear the burden of our current misguided immigration system.",,
