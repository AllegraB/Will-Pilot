If in a few months from now the Supreme Court looks likeóIím pretty scared itís going to, a court that would overturn Roe and make the president above the rule of law. What is to be done?îAccording to footage from the event that NTK Network obtained on Thursday, Ocasio-Cortez replied: ìI think that we take back the House, we take back the Senate, we take back the presidency, and we pack the Supreme Court of the United States of America.îLeft-wing activists have been demanding that Democrats become more aggressive when it comes to the Supreme Court after Brett Kavanaughís confirmation hearings and Democrats like Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) have been referring to Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh as ìillegitimate.îAfter Kavanaugh was sworn in as retiring Justice Anthony Kennedyís replacement on the Supreme Court, left-wing†law professors, editorial pages of left-wing and establishment media outlets, and even lawmakers like Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), who was the only sitting member of Congress to endorse Ocasio-Cortez before her shocking primary upset over Rep. Joe Crowley (D-NY), have been insisting that Democrats must seriously consider packing the Supreme Court the next time Democrats control all three branches of government.

Claire McCaskill (D-MO) announced that she would be voting against Kavanaugh, Hawley took a two-point lead over McCaskill in the polls.Hawley, according to a poll released last week by a pro-Hawley super PAC, has since expanded his lead to eight percentage points over McCaskill.ìThe way that they attempted to smear Justice Kavanaugh, what they did to Dr.[Christine Blasey] Ford to be treating her as collateral damage,î he added. ìI get asked about it at every stop, every day.î

Jeff Merkley (D-OR), a potential 2020 presidential candidate, said this week that he will push for the Justice Department to ìpursue felony chargesî against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh for lying to the Senate during his confirmation hearings.In an interview on The Interceptís ìDeconstructedî podcast that was released on Thursday, Merkley was asked what Democrats could do about Kavanaugh since they are not going to have 67 votes to impeach him in the near future.ìLetís start with the proposition that the Justice Department could, obviously under a different leader than President Trump, proceed to pursue felony charges against Brett Kavanaugh for perjury before the U.S. Senate,î Merkley said.When asked if he would be pushing for that, Merkley replied, ìAbsolutely.îMerkley further added that the Supreme Court is now ìthe most powerful legislative bodyî and declared that ìit is a legislative body controlled by and for the powerful rather than by and for the people.îRep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), who is set to become the chair of the House Judiciary Committee if Democrats take back the House after November, recently said the House would further investigate the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh if Democrats are in charge next year.ìIt is not something we are eager to do,î Nadler reportedly said. ìBut the Senate having failed to do its proper constitutionally mandated job of advise and consent, we are going to have to do something to provide a check and balance, to protect the rule of law and to protect the legitimacy of one of our most important institutions.îMerkleyís comments further reveal that Democrats are not going to let Kavanaughís confirmation go and offer a preview of what Democrats could try to do if they end up controlling all three branches of government after the 2020 elections.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/10/11/law-students-organize-nationwide-3-day-walkout-over-brett-kavanaugh/,"Law students around the country are skipping class this week to protest Brett Kavanaughís confirmation to the Supreme Court.Law students around the country are in the middle of a three-day walkout protest over Brett Kavanaughís confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States. Starting on Wednesday, students at law schools around the country walked out of their classrooms at 2:15 p.m. with the intention of returning on Monday morning. The students believe their protest will encourage congressional†candidates to announce their commitment to impeaching recently confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.Students at the law schools at American University, Duke University, Emory University, Georgetown University, New York University, and Temple University have signed on to participate in the protest.In an open letter on the StrikeAgainstKavanaugh.com, student organizers say that they donít believe Brett Kavanaugh is a ìlegitimateî Supreme Court justice. The letter makes an unusual tie-in to Americaís history of brutality against Native Americans.We are in the middle of a national emergency. Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed to the Supreme Court. We cannot accept a system that empowers a man who repeatedly lied under oath and a judiciary review process that only performs a sham of an investigation into his misconduct.†We do not recognize Kavanaugh as a legitimate member of the United States Supreme Court.As we announce this strike on Indigenous Peoplesí Day, we recognize the ongoing harm indigenous people have suffered under the American legal system. The United States was borne out of conquest of indigenous people by European colonizers whose descendants became this countryís founders. Since the Supreme Courtís first case involving indigenous rights,†the Court has heard hundreds of cases and it has been grossly unjust to indigenous plaintiffs and defendants. Later this term, the Court † could curtail the hunting rights of the Crow Tribes, rights which are ìcentral to [the] Tribesí subsistence, economy, culture, spiritual life, and day-to-day existence.î We do not believe that Kavanaugh will be a champion for indigenous peoplesí rights, and fear the worst for the indigenous communities who have already faced so much harm from the Court.A local news report from Wednesday revealed that students at Ohio State Universityís law school walked out of their classrooms at 11:10 a.m. to protest Kavanaughís confirmation. Students told reporters that they believed that Dr. Fordís allegations were not taken seriously by members of Congress. Some said that they participated in the protest to bring attention to the ever-present issue of sexual assault.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/11/mike-braun-hammers-joe-donnelly-for-hillary-clinton-support-opposition-to-brett-kavanaugh/,"Hoosier businessman Mike Braun slammed Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN) in a campaign ad released Thursday for supporting Hillary Clinton. He also took issue†with his opposition to confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Braun, the Indiana Senate Republican candidate, released a campaign ad hammering the Hoosier Democrat for opposing Kavanaugh, supporting Obamaís Iran nuclear deal, outsourcing jobs to Mexico, and supporting Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.ìHillary for President? And Donnelly says heís for common sense? Sorry, Senator, youíre just not one of us. Youíre one of them,î the narrator in the ad said.ìHoosiers know itís not what you say, itís what youíve done: Senator Donnelly joined the extreme left in opposing Justice Kavanaugh, fell in line with President Obamaís dangerous Iran nuclear deal, profited from outsourcing Hoosier jobs to Mexico, and worked nonstop to elect Hillary Clinton,î said Braun in a press release on Thursday. ìDonnelly will say anything, but look at what heís done: heís not one of us, heís one of them.îDonnellyís opposition to Kavanaugh caused the Indiana†News-Sentinel†to publish an editorial urging Hoosier voters to vote ìnoî against the Indiana Democrat for another term in the U.S. Senate.Braunís new ad comes off the heels of an exclusive Breitbart News report which revealed that the Indiana GOP filed a Senate Ethics complaint over Donnellyís ìillegalî use of an official Neil Gorsuch photo in a campaign ad.Last year the Associated Press (AP) reported that while Sen. Donnelly criticized Carrier Corp. for moving manufacturing jobs to Mexico, he profited from a family business that relied on Mexican labor to produce dye for ink pads.Donnelly, during his first run for the House in 2004,†railed†against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and called ìoutsourcing,î ìa fancy term for ëSomeone in Indiana has just lost their job.îBraun†told†Breitbart News in an interview that in contrast to Donnelly, he hires exclusively in the United States and most of his suppliers for his business also come from America.The Indiana Senate race has become increasingly competitive; a Fox News poll found that Sen. Donnelly†leads†Braun by only two points, well within the surveyís margin of error.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/11/indiana-news-sentinel-editorial-hoosiers-should-vote-against-joe-donnelly/,"The Indiana News-Sentinel published an editorial on Thursday urging Hoosiers to vote against Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), citing his vote opposing Judge Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.The News-Sentinel suggested that Donnelly would imperil his political future if he were to oppose President Donald Trumpís nominee to the Supreme Court; Donnelly voted against confirming Kavanaugh last Saturday despite polls showing an increasingly tight race between him and Hoosier businessman Mike Braun.The Hoosier paper also pointed out that despite Donnellyís vote against the presidentís nominee, during Mondayís debate against Braun and Libertarian candidate Lucy Brenton, he attempted to tie himself with Donald Trump.ìIt was clear in the televised, hour-long debate that Donnelly was hitching himself to the president as much as possible to assuage the concerns of Indianaís swing voters who may have voted for Trump in 2016,î the News-Sentinel wrote.ìI go against my party all the time,î Donnelly said in an attempt to rebuke Braunís attack that he follows Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumerís (D-NY) marching orders. ìIíve been with the president 62 percent of the time.îHowever, the Hoosier paper notes that the same Congressional Quarterly report details how Donnelly also voted with the Democrat party 74 percent of the time, and another report notes that Donnelly voted with Schumer 85 percent of the time since 2013.During the debate, Braun said that a vote for Donnelly represents the status quo.ìIf you want more of the same. Joeís your guy,î Braun said.On Mondayís debate, the Hoosier Democrat said that he opposed Kavanaugh due to his alleged ìimpartiality and judicial temperament,î despite that Donnelly cites Christine Blasey Fordís sexual assault accusation against Kavanaugh as his primary concern. Donnelly said that Fordís testimony was ìdisturbing and credibleî and called on the FBI to investigate the accusation.ìDonnelly never mentioned the judgeís temperament or any issues of impartiality until after the FBIís report that there was nothing to substantiate Fordís claims,î the News-Sentinel explained.The Hoosier News-Sentinel contended that no matter the explanation, Sen. Donnelly, and most Senate Democrats, planned to vote against Kavanaugh to block a conservative majority on the Supreme Court and because of that, Hoosiers should vote against Donnelly in November.ìWe still believe Donnelly, like the vast majority of Democrats, was set on voting ìnoî against Kavanaugh no matter what in order to block a conservative majority on the court,î the Hoosier paper concluded. ìAnd for that, we still believe Indiana should vote ìnoî for another Donnelly term in Washington.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/10/democrats-warily-eye-avenatti-2020-bid/,"Some Democratic Party leaders are ìwarilyî eyeing TV Resistance lawyer Michael Avenatti as he gears up for a potential 2020 bid, according to the Associated Press.According to the report, ìsome party leaders are worried about trying to replicate Trumpís approach by backing another untested and unpredictable candidate ó a concern that was heightened after Avenattiís involvement in the recent Supreme Court confirmation fight.îAvenatti has dismissed criticism he helped Justice Brett Kavanaugh get confirmed after he presented a client, Julie Swetnick, who claimed she had been gang-raped at parties that Kavanaugh allegedly attended. She also claimed that Kavanaugh ìspikedî punch at the parties, only to back away from that claim during a disastrous MSNBC interview. MSNBC later said they could not corroborate her stories with any of the four people she listed as witnesses.Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who cast a key vote for Kavanaugh, cited Swetnickís ìoutlandishî allegations in her decision.Avenatti told the AP the criticism is ìbeing stoked by the Republicans and establishment Democrats that are very nervous about what my intentions are.îìThis is a direct response to individuals coming to the conclusion that I am a threat,î he said.According to the article, Avenatti has been undertaking serious preparation to make a bid in 2020, speaking with Democratic strategists in Washington, and state operatives. He has been speaking at Democratic Party dinners in Iowa and New Hampshire.Avenatti told the AP he has ìdonors lined upî should he run and that he would have no problem raising money. He has already launched a federal political action committee, The Fight PAC, and is being advised by Los Angeles-based fundraiser Tracy Austin, former Hillary Clinton campaign aide†Adam Parkhomenko, and digital media strategist Stephen Solomon.He has also begun attacking other potential 2020 Democratic contenders, such as Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ).ìI have a lot of respect for @CoryBooker. But we have VERY different views as to how to solve the crisis of Donald Trump and the dumpster fire of his presidency. #FireWithFire #HitHarder #FightClub,î Avenatti†tweeted†after Booker went to Iowa.So far, his claim to fame has been representing porn actress Stormy Daniels, who claimed to have had sex with Trump once more than a decade ago.Steve Shurtleff, the top Democrat in the New Hampshire state house, told the AP that Avenattiís entrance into the Kavanaugh confirmation process helped it become a ìthree-ring circus.îStill, other Democrats disagree, saying his involvement fired up the party. As to whether it will help him as a candidate,†Iowa Democrat Randy Brown, who hosted Avenatti at a Democratic fundraiser in August, seemed to demur.Avenatti was simply ìdoing what he does best ó getting his name out there,î he said.

And if you really wanted to know the truth, you sure as hell wouldnít have done what youíve done to this guy.îThe comment came after Graham delivered an address at a dinner hosted by the†Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) to celebrate U.S.-Israel military ties. At the beginning of his remarks, he had commented,† ìWe believe in the rule of law, not mob rule.îAsked later whether he was also referring to Kavanaughís confirmation, he affirmed that he was, but also tied his remark to the Middle East.ìThereís a process in the civilized world to arrive at decisions. Democracies donít go to war. What weíre missing in the Mid-East is more democracies. If you had democracies in the Mid-East, youíd have less war. I canít think of any war between two democracies, so the point here is that democracies are held together by the rule of law,î he said.

Leftists vandalized and destroyed our signs, threw paint and water at our members, and hurled insults and profanities for hours. This is the state of poltical discourse at Stanford University: defined by the violent and childlish antics of the unhinged left.îThe event mirrored others in Washington during Justice Brett Kavanaughís confirmation process. Liberals swarmed the Capitol, protesting inside Senate buildings and on the steps of the Supreme Court.One viral video showed two young liberals harassing an elderly pro-Kavanaugh protester, who was holding up signs silently. At one point, one of of the young liberals hit and appeared to damage his signs.Look at these tolerant, progressive protesters dancing around this lone, 71 year old Trump supporter ñ they eventually try and rip his signs up but are stopped by organizers. pic.twitter.com/X8evmEzmzxó Benny (@bennyjohnson) October 6, 2018

Joe Donnelly (D-IN), a vulnerable Democrat up for re-election, for what it saysñand Donnellyís own campaign spokesman admittedñis an illegal use in a campaign ad of an official U.S. Senate photograph of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and Donnelly standing together before Gorsuchís confirmation.Ahead of its public release, Breitbart News has obtained a statement from the Indiana GOP chairman and a letter the Indiana GOP sent to the U.S. Senate Ethics Committee alleging Donnellyís campaign engaged in illegal activity that also violates Senate Ethics Rules for using the official Gorsuch photo in his campaign advertisement airing on television.In the television ad that Donnelly is airing in Indiana, Donnelly touts his supposed closeness with President Donald Trump.ìI have a 99 percent attendance recordñbut itís not just about showing up,î Donnelly says in the ad, speaking directly into the camera. ìItís about delivering for Hoosiers.îThen a narrator comes on and says Donnelly ìbroke with his party and voted for Trumpís border wall three times,î and then the narrator says: ìAnd Joe voted for the presidentís first Supreme Court Justice, Neil Gorsuch.îAt that point, on screen is an official photograph of Donnelly standing with Gorsuch from their official U.S. Senate meeting when GorsuchñTrumpís first selection to the U.S. Supreme Court in the first year of his first termñwas in the confirmation process. Donnelly ended up voting for Gorsuch, but Donnelly would laterñin 2018, Trumpís second yearñvote against the presidentís second selection to the U.S. Supreme Cour, now- Justice Brett Kavanaugh.WATCH THE DONNELLY AD HERE:The official Senate photo of Donnelly with Gorsuch first appears at about 14 seconds into the above ad.This is significant for a number of reasons. Donnelly demonstrated he was in the end part and parcel of the radical leftist Democrat Senatorsí unsuccessful ploy to attempt to take down Kavanaugh with uncorroborated smears and baseless, evidence-free allegations. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, during the confirmation process of Kavanaugh, Donnellyís team also filmed and photographed the official U.S. Senate meeting the Democrat senator had with Kavanaugh before he announced he was a no. At that time, it was expected Donnelly may, as he did with Gorsuch, eventually vote in favor of Kavanaughís confirmation.When it was revealed publicly that Donnelly and his official Senate staff used government resources to film and photograph the meeting, the Indiana GOP cried fou,l warning Donnelly against using such materials in campaign advertisements. In a Breitbart News exclusive at the time, Josh Kelley, the spokesman for Donnellyís GOP challenger businessman Mike Braun, hammered Donnelly for serious ethical lapses with regards to the footage:Career politician Joe Donnelly blocked cameras from his meeting with Judge Kavanaugh, but that didnít stop him from secretly filming the meeting so his buddy Chuck Schumer and other liberals could use the footage for political ads. This behavior reaffirms that Donnelly will vote for Kavanaugh once his confirmation is secured, and his taxpayer-funded office creating footage for campaign ads borders on serious ethical issues.Taken aback by the forceful condemnation of their tactics and use of government resources potentially for campaign purposes, Donnellyís spokesman pushed back at the time in a local news report, actually admitting that use of those photographs or videos from the Kavanaugh meeting in any Donnelly campaign ad would be outright ìillegal.îìThis nakedly political stunt is just the latest bald-faced lie from Rep. Braunís campaign. The fact of the matter is that Donnelly for Indiana has no intention of using that footage in an ad ó but more importantly, even if the campaign or any outside group wanted to use this footage, it would be illegal,î Donnelly campaign spokesman Will Baskin-Gerwitz said, per the Journal-Gazette in August of this year.Donnelly ended up voting against Kavanaugh in the end, so that footage and those photos were useless politically for him and he is paying dearly for the move back home in Indiana with just weeks to go before the Nov. 6 midterm election. But that raises the question: Would the same behavior Donnellyís team says is illegal regarding Kavanaugh be equally illegal with another Supreme Court Justice, like Gorsuch?And thatís where the Indiana GOP comes in, with regard to this new ad that Donnelly is hitting airwaves with in Indiana featuring an official photograph of the senator and Gorsuch. In a statement that will be released publicly on Thursday morning but was provided to Breitbart News exclusively on Wednesday night,† Indiana GOP chairman Kyle Hupfer unloaded.†Hupfer said in the statement.Democrat Joe Donnelly is so desperate to fool Hoosiers into thinking heís a not a liberal Democrat, heíll violate Senate ethics and break federal law to do it. Even his own spokesman admitted itís illega. Back in August, Democrat Donnellyís campaign said politicizing the confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice would be a disservice to Hoosiers. Since then, Donnellyís Democrat Party has led a three-ring circus to delay and destroy Justice Kavanaugh. Now, as Donnelly is illegally abusing taxpayer resources to politicize a Supreme Court nominee to save his job, Hoosiers can see itís Donnelly whoís doing them a real disservice. Today, I am filing a formal complaint with the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate Senator Donnellyís flagrant abuse of taxpayer dollars in a desperate bid to get re-electeqed. In the meantime, Donnellyís campaign must immediately cease running this ad and issue a public apology to Hoosier taxpayers.The Indiana GOP, at Hupferís direction, has filed an official ethics complaint with the U.S. Senate Ethics Committee about Donnellyís new ad. In the letter to Senate Ethics Committee chairman Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA) and Ranking Member Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), obtained by Breitbart News ahead of its public release, the Indiana GOP requests a formal Senate Ethics Committee investigation of Donnellyís ìimproper and illegal use of official resources for campaign purposesî which the Indiana GOP charges is in violation of†31 U.S.C. 1301(a) and U.S. Senate Ethics Rules.In the letter to the Senate Ethics Committee leaders, the Indiana GOP argues that this is a violation of federal law and a violation of Senate Ethics Rules. The Indiana GOP wrote to the Senate Ethics Committee in the letter dated October 10:Federal law and Senate Ethics Rules make clear that official resources may only be used for official purposes. The General Appropriations Statute, 31 U.S.C. ß 1301 states that ëappropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.í This Committee has made clear that this statute means ëit is thus inappropriate to use any official resources to conduct campaign or political activities.í Additionally, ëSenate space, equipment, staff time and resources generally should not be used to assist campaign organizations.íThe letter cites the Senate Ethics manual and various federal laws to make its case. The Indiana GOP wrote, citing a 1982 case.:Federal case law has also affirmed that ëCongress has recognized the basic principle that government funds should not be spent to help incumbents gain reelection. Senate Internet Services and Technology Resources Usage Rules adopted by the Senate Rules Committee also state that the use of Senate Internet Services and Senate technology resources for campaign purposes is prohibited.The letter also quotes the Donnelly spokesman admitting that such behavior would be illegal and says that the Indiana GOP agrees with Donnellyís spokesman about that:A spokesman for Donnellyís campaign previously acknowledged that using material posted online by Donnellyís official Senate office for campaign purposes would violate Senate Ethics Rules. In response to a complaint related to a video of Donnelly and Justice Kavanaugh posted by Donnellyís official office, Donnellyís spokesman said that ëif the [Donnelly] campaign or any outside group wanted to use this footage, it would be illegalí We agree. Like the video of Donnelly and Kavanaugh, the picture used in the advertisement by the Donnelly campaign was taken in Donnellyís Senate office and posted online by an account for Donnellyís official office. By Donnellyís own admission, this use of official resources is illegal.It remains to be seen where this goes from here, but this does not appear to be a positive development for Donnelly.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/10/project-veritas-video-campaign-staffers-say-phil-bredesen-lied-about-kavanaugh-vote/,"Campaign staffers for Tennessee Democrat Senate nominee Phil Bredesen say he lied on Friday when he released a statement saying he would have voted ìyesî to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, according to a new undercover video released by Project Veritas Action on Wednesday night.Bredesen campaign field organizer Maria Amalla was captured on video by a female journalist sent undercover into one of the Bredesen campaignís Nashville offices describing Bredesenís statement on Friday as ìa political moveî that was necessary because ìheís trying to make up points.îThe undercover journalist told another person, identified in the Project Veritas video as Will Stewart, Phil Bredesen Campaign: ìI was so confused because I just canít believe he would actually vote yes [to confirm Kavanaugh.]îìHe wouldnít. Heís just saying he would,î Stewart said in response.Bredesen trails Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN-07), the Republican nominee, by eight points in a CBS Poll released on Sunday.Another exchange between the undercover journalist and a person identified as James Miller, Voter Protection, Bredesen Campaign, was equally illuminating.ìBecause, I mean he [Phil Bredesen] wouldnít really [vote to confirm Kavanaugh], right?î the journalist asked Miller.ìI donít think so. Um, and I think itís not reassuring, but itís something that I think gives me . . . The feeling is that of reassurance, but itís certainly not reassuring. I think much like Doug Jones, or somebody,î Miller answered.ìWho did you say?î the journalist asked.ìDoug Jones of Alabama. That guy didnít vote for him [Kavanaugh]. Phil Bredesenís not going to vote for him [Kavanaugh]. The only reason Joe Manchin did is heís running right now,î Miller said. The dialogue continued:Miller: Once youíre in, six years, youíre gonna do the right thing.Journalist: Heíll be a good Democrat, I know he will.Miller: 100 percent. Always has been.Journalist: Itís just a political move, right?Miller: YeahJournalist: Thatís the only way I canÖMiller: But, isnít it gross?Journalist: YesMiller: Yeah, thatís like the way it has to goJournalist: I just hate that he has to like lie to get that voteMiller: I know, I know. Tell me about it. Unfortunately, thatís realityAccording to the people identified by Project Veritas as Bredesen campaign staffers filmed on the video, Bredesen has misled Tennessee voters about how he views President Donald Trump as well.ìIíld like to think in my little heart that heís not a super fan of Trump,î the undercover journalist said on the video.ìHeís not. Between you and me, once Phil actually gets into the Senate, heíll be a good Democrat,î Will Stewart said, adding:Stewart: And itís also just the start of something big, you know?Journalist: The resistance.Stewart: Yeah. Yeah. We donít say that out of these walls. But here, of course, we talk about that. Cause itís so funny. The message is, like, donít talk about the blue wave.Weíre not running against Trump. All this sort of stuff. Even though thatís all why we are all here. We canít put it out there.ìI canít help but think that Phil is the same way though,î the journalist said.ìOh yeah. Oh, he hates Trump, like yeah. Heís not going to be running for re-election. He can get in there and do the right thing,î Stewart responded.Those working at the Bredesen Senate campaign office in Nashville also had very clear instructions about how to ìstay on messageî by not discussing ìthe Blue Waveî or Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) with voters:Bredesen staffer: Did you hear about that?Stewart: The Blue wave?Staffer: Yeah, you canít say that too often here.Journalist: I donít understand why, though?Stewart: Weíre allowed to say it, but itís off messageStaffer: Yeah, the others?Journalist: What others?Stewart: Like, campaign-wide, itís not our message. You can say it in here, but like on those calls and stuff, thatís not a message we want to be sending. Because weíre not runningÖBredesen campaign worker Drew: We would scare all the people who would vote for Phil Bredesen but not Chuck Schumer.Stewart: Yeah, exactly, because thereís a lot of people who are Republicans who are going to vote for him.†You can watch the full video here.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/10/nancy-pelosi-kavanaugh-belongs-on-the-supreme-court-like-a-fly-on-the-moon/,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told the†San Francisco†Chronicle†editorial board Wednesday afternoon that newly-installed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh ìno longer belongs there (on the Court) than a fly on the moon.îChronicle editor-in-chief Audrey Cooper live-tweeted Pelosiís pre-election meeting with the editorial board, noting that Pelosi pushed back against suggestions that she would impeach Justice Kavanaugh if Democrats won the House in November:.@nancypelosi says she would not push to impeach Justice Kavanaugh if the Democrats take control of the House.ìPeople just care about how we are going to make their lives better.îó Audrey Cooper (@audreycoopersf) October 10, 2018Other Pelosi quip on Justice Kavanaugh: ìHe no longer belongs there (on the SC) than a fly on the moon.îó Audrey Cooper (@audreycoopersf) October 10, 2018The idea of impeaching Kavanaugh has been floating around Democratic Party circles for several days, even before Kavanaugh was confirmed last week. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), who would chair the House Judiciary Committee if Democrats take control, said that he would re-open investigations into alleged sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh.
Last month, after confirmation hearings in the Senate had concluded, Kavanaugh was suddenly accused of sexual misconduct more than three decades before, when he was in high school and university. He denied the claims vigorously, and no corrobroating evidence was ever produced to support the allegations. Outrage over the way Democrats pursued the claims against Kavanaugh has been cited in several recent polls as boosting Republican enthusiasm to turn out in the election.Pelosi has indicated that she intends to run for Speaker of the House if Democrats win. She held the position from 2007 to 2011, and clung to power in her caucus after leading her party to historic defeat in 2010.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/10/poll-patrick-morrisey-and-joe-manchin-in-virtual-tie-in-west-virginia-senate-race/,"West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) have struck a virtual dead heat, according to a poll released on Wednesday.A new poll commissioned by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) found that Manchin leads by only one pointñ41 to 40 percentñover Morrisey in the West Virginia Senate race. The poll surveyed 600 likely voters from October 7-10 and had a margin of error of four points, making the race a virtual toss-up.The NRSC survey polled voters immediately after Sen. Manchin voted to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.The poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies also found that Manchinís favorability hit a new lowó45 percent of West Virginia voters have a favorable opinion of Manchin, while 50 percent of voters have an unfavorable view of the incumbent Democrat. Forty-five percent of voters, or a plurality of voters, consider themselves conservative while only 17 percent of West Virginians consider Sen. Manchin conservative.West Virginian voters also said that recent campaign ads had given them a negative impression of Sen. Manchin. Of the 90 percent of voters who said that they have recently read or heard something about Manchin, 54 percent said that it made them less likely to vote for him, compared to 32 percent who said that it made them more likely to back Sen. Manchin.The NRSC poll found that President Donald Trump remains popular in the state and that they would rather have a Republican represent their interests in the U.S. Senate. President has a 62 percent approval rating in the state, and 44 percent of voters said that they would rather have a Republican represent them, compared to 39 percent who would rather have a Democrat in the U.S. Senate.Nathan Brand, a spokesman for Morrisey, said in a statement on Wednesday that Manchinís support will continue to drop as they learn about his liberal voting record. Brand said:As West Virginia voters learn more about Joe Manchinís record of being a dishonest Washington liberal who stood with Obama for gun control, and supported Hillary Clinton for President, they know he canít be trusted. This race will come down to who voters trust to stand with President Trump, and the choice is clear: Morrisey is the Trump endorsed candidate while Joe Manchin is one more vote for Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosiís resist and obstruct circus.This new survey comes on the heels of a Morning Consult survey which found that Manchin was one of the top ten least popular senators, with a 43 percent unfavorable rating and a 44 percent approval rating.Sen. Manchin represents a deep-red state that went for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election by 42 points.Attorney General Morrisey continues to attack Manchin for refusing to be the deciding vote for Kavanaugh, contending that he only came out for the presidentís nominee only after Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) announced her vote to support Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.Morrisey tweeted, ìAmazing to hear such dishonesty from @JoeManchinWV on radio this AM. Manchin misleads Hoppy about his cloture vote ó Manchin ducked making a decision until Collins voted for Kavanaugh. Thatís because he promised Schumer he wouldnít be the deciding vote.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/10/after-democrats-fail-on-kavanaugh-poll-shows-washington-state-battleground-district-moving-safely-back-to-gop/,"A new poll from Washingtonís eighth congressional district shows Republican Dino Rossi raking a commanding lead over Democrat Kim Schrier in the wake of Democratsí failed smear attempt on Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.The poll, published Wednesday, shows Rossi with a commanding 10-point lead in the battleground district in his race against Schrier to replace retiring Rep. Dave Reichert (R-WA) in one of the districts that could determine the fate of the majority of the House of Representatives.At 49 percent, Rossi leads Schrierís 39 percent, well outside the pollís five percent margin of error. The survey of 400 eligible voters was conducted from Oct. 4 to Oct. 9 by Crosscut/Elway.In a piece on the poll, Crosscutís David Kroman wrote that this was unmistakably due to the Democratsí mishandling of the Kavanaugh confirmation.ìRossi, a former state senator and real-estate investor, saw an especially large bump last weekend, claiming a 24-point advantage among voters surveyed in the hours and days immediately after the U.S. Senateís vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh,î Kroman wrote. ìThose respondents made up nearly a third of the total voters surveyed.îKromanís piece cites Elway Research president and pollster Stuart Elway as saying it appears as though the Democratsí handling of Kavanaugh has ìerasedî their advantage heading into the midterms.ìWhat appears to have happened here is the Kavanaugh hearings have erased [the Democratsí] advantage,î Elway, whom Crosscut notes has an A plus rating on FiveThirtyEight after decades of polling work, said. ìNow it looks like what you would have expected this district to look like before everyone was talking about a blue wave.îThe fact that Republican Rossi is so far ahead of Democrat Schrier in this district is nothing short of an amazing development for Republicans. Just a few weeks ago, Rossi trailed Schrier by a single percentage pointñ45 percent to 46 percentñin a New York Times/Siena College survey† in September.This district has been GOP-held, but close, since its creation in the 1980s. Republicans have never lost it, and Reichert moved into the seat replacing now former Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-WA) in the early 2000s and held it for several terms. Dunn was elected in the early 1990s to replace the districtís first-ever member, now former Rep. Rod Chandler (R-WA). To reiterate, this district for nearly 40 years has been in GOP handsñand Reichert had represented it for over a decade, but the Cook Partisan Voting Index this year had rated the race as even chances for either party, GOP or Democrats, and some polling had shown the Democrat Schrier with an outside chance at winning.Now, though, after the way Democrats handled Justice Kavanaughís confirmation, that potential edge seems to have slipped away and Rossiñbarring some unforeseen circumstancesñappears poised to win re-election. That means another seat Democrats thought they were going to take on a march back into the House majority handing now Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi back the Speakerís gavel for the first time in eight years has slipped out of reach, and Republicans have a better chance at limiting losses to less than the requisite number of seats Democrats would need to take to take back the majority. That so-called magic number is 24 seats.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/10/ann-coulter-gop-needs-update-dems-ufc-cage-match-rules/,"Itís time to update the GOPís Marquess of Queensbury Rules.If you saw Ruth Bader Ginsburg at Brett Kavanaughís swearing-in ceremony, you know that we may need to fill her seat in about 4 1/2 minutes. Naturally, I hope she lives to be 300 ó although parenthetically, it seems she already has.The confirmation hearings for Kavanaugh made Robert Borkís hearings look like a day at the beach. At least liberals only lied about Borkís judicial philosophy. They didnít accuse him of being Ted Bundy. The next nomination hearing will make Kavanaughís look like an ice cream social.Just because it didnít work this time doesnít mean Republicansí work is done. They have to make sure this never happens again.Democrats are already pushing the idea that Kavanaughís confirmation was somehow illegitimate because of the shoddy FBI investigation. Liberalsí beef is that the FBI neglected to interview Kavanaughís former Yale classmates, who dispute his characterization of precisely how big a drinker he was in college.I wouldnít say he was a belligerent drunk, but more of an obstreperous drunk.No, no! I would say he was a mild drunk with periods of obstreperousness.This is not the stuff of perjury prosecutions.Of course, if true, itís HUGE. Kavanaughís demeanor when drunk in college sounds nearly as awful as liberalsí behavior when sober ó obnoxious, aggressive and argumentative. I refer you to the recent antics weíve seen on Capitol Hill, as well as anywhere Ted Cruz stops in for a bite.Since none of the FBIís latest report on Kavanaugh has leaked, the one thing we can be sure of is that the agents turned up nothing unfavorable on him. Except for a colonoscopy, I think weíre done with Kavanaugh.Itís the accusers who have skirted investigation. Even Republicans have moved on. Heís on the court, so who cares if Kavanaugh was falsely accused of ìrapeî in front of his little girls?Thatís what everyone thought when the falsely accused Duke lacrosse players were proved innocent and the D.A. was disbarred. Why go after the accuser? Hasnít she suffered enough?Crystal Mangum was not prosecuted for falsely charging she was gang-raped. And see? No harm, no foul! She went on to live a happy and productive ó oh, wait! The next time we heard about Mangum was when she stabbed her boyfriend to death.On reflection, it certainly seems possible that Kavanaugh accuser Julie Swetnick was not being completely, 100 percent honest in her sworn statements about repeatedly attending high school parties in the 1980s, when she was a college student, where underage girls were drugged and gang-raped.Deborah Ramirezís three-decade-old, unsubstantiated, recovered memory of a drunken Kavanaugh exposing himself as a college freshman is the sort of charge that makes feminists laugh! (I know that from reading Gloria Steinemís explanation in The New York Times that Gov. Bill Clinton summoning a female underling to his hotel room, dropping his pants and saying, ìKiss it!î did not rise to the level of sexual harassment. He took ìnoî for an answer!)Perhaps Republicans could get Steinem to explain under oath why itís acceptable for a sitting governor to do what is disqualifying for a drunk college freshman to do.While no one would question the word of a living saint like Christine Blasey Ford, some parts of her testimony demand the clarity that can be obtained only in a formal legal proceeding ó such as her trauma-induced need for two front doors (when the second front door seems clearly attached to a rental apartment); her fear of flying (but only when it will delay a confirmation hearing); and her claim that she never helped anyone prepare for a polygraph (contradicted by her ex-live-in boyfriend); among other things.Pretending they are the wronged ones, liberals keep yipping about Barack Obamaís Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. They believe any attack on Kavanaugh was justified after the dirty trick pulled by Republicans on Garland.The Republicansí refusal to hold hearings on Garland has been called an ìunprecedented obstructionî (MSNBCís Chris Hayes), a ìviolation of traditions in normsî (Hayes again), an ìinsult and injuryî (Sen. Cory Booker) and ìremarkable and unprecedentedî (MSNBCís Rachel Maddow). The GOPís treatment of Garland showed their ìhypocrisy on Brett Kavanaughî (MSNBCís Ari Melber).The truth is apparently a big secret, inasmuch as even Republicans arenít saying it. Youíll read it here for the first time.The Republicansí wily, underhanded, double-dealing trick with Garland was this: Win a majority of seats in the U.S. Senate! I know liberals wonít read the Constitution, but can they do math? Garland didnít have the votes.Republicans had 54 seats and, in 2016, Senate rules still required 60 votes for Supreme Court appointments. Democrats would have needed 14 Republican senators to switch sides to confirm a Democratic presidentís nominee.There was no way that was happening. A Republican Senate simply wasnít going to give ìconsentî to any Democratic nominee eight months before a presidential election ó even an election that everyone thought Hillary was going to win. The Constitution says ìadvice and consent,î not ìadvice and rubber-stamp.îThere was nothing ìunprecedentedî about a Republican Senate rejecting a Democratic nominee ó other than the fact that Republicans were the ones doing it. Democrats do it all the time.Thatís how we got Justice Anthony Kennedy ó whom Kavanaugh replaced: A Democratic Senate rejected Reagan nominee Robert Bork. Thatís also how we got Harry Blackmun, author of the ridiculously lawless Roe v. Wade: A Democratic Senate rejected Richard Nixonís previous nominees Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell.It would have been a waste of time and only humiliated Garland to hold hearings. At least Republicans didnít accuse him of gang rape.COPYRIGHT 2018 ANN COULTER

And I hope that Republicans, and I hope people that want Republicans that voted for Trump realize that if thereís [not] a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, not only will there be talk of impeachment of Kavanaugh or the president, but even if there isnít talk of impeachment, effectively the program of the presidentís going to come to a halt. Heíll have a two year Trump presidency. The last two years will be status quo. And unless heís reelected, thatís the end of it.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/10/10/jordan-peterson-attempts-to-explain-his-call-for-kavanaugh-to-step-down/,"Jordan Peterson attempted to explain his call for Brett Kavanaugh to step down from his appointment to the Supreme Court in a blog post published on Tuesday.In a blog post published on Tuesday, Professor Jordan Peterson attempted to explain a tweet in which he called for Bret Kavanaugh to step down from his appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States. Petersonís followers aggressively pushed back against his call for Kavanaugh to step down, and he eventually clarified his thoughts on the topic in a subsequent series of tweets.In the blog post, Peterson more or less argues that Kavanaugh should step down in order to promote peace and stability in the United States.I asked myself a question, after reading these posts: ìIs there an alternative to confirming or not confirming Kavanaugh?î When a choice appears starkly binary, a third path appears impossible, by definition ó but might possibly still be worth seeking. I tried to place myself in Kavanaughís position, while generating a potential answer (and think that I can do so with some justification, having been publicly identified as reprehensible by many peopleóprominent journalists, activists, and academics among them).I thought, ìHe canít withdraw, prior to the nomination, because his reputation has been savaged so badly that withdrawal would not only mean loss of the Supreme Court nomination, but demolition of his entire career and future life.î So the only way for Kavanaugh was forward, through the FBI investigation, on to the nomination hearing, and the hope that he would beÖ what? Cleared? Not cleared, because it is too late for that, even given the favorable or at least not damning FBI report. A large percentage of the American public does not believe that he is an appropriate choice for the highest bench position in the land (51%, according to NY Mag). Iím not claiming, necessarily, that CNNís poll is reliable. It doesnít matter. What matters is that there is very widespread opposition to his candidacy, much of it generated not by peopleís belief in his innocence or lack therefore but by their objection to the manner in which both parties handled the nomination process.Itís not a good thing when there is general discomfort with the manner in which something as important as the naming of a new Chief Justice is undertaken. It doesnít bode well for the stability and peace of the state (and perhapsñperhapsñthere is nothing more important to preserve than that).You can read the entirety of Petersonís blog post here.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/10/poll-bob-menendez-claire-mccaskill-bill-nelsons-popularity-plummets/,"Sens. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), and Bill Nelsonís (D-FL) popularity plummeted, according to a poll released on Wednesday.A Morning Consult poll released on Wednesday found that Sens. Menendez, McCaskill, and Nelsonís popularity has plummeted since the second quarter of 2018óthe last time Morning Consult ran this poll. The Senate Democrats represent three of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats up for re-election this November.Sen. Nelson, who faces a contentious race against Florida Gov. Rick Scott, saw a dramatic 12-point decline since the second quarter. The third quarter of 2018 represents the first time that Florida voters had a net-disapproval of Nelson, with a 41 percent of Floridians disapproving of the senator, while only 39 percent of voters approving of the incumbent Democrat. According to the Real Clear Politics average, Nelson only leads by two points over Gov. Scott.Sen. McCaskill saw a net drop of seven points in her approval rating in the third quarter and remains virtually tied with Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley. McCaskill, according to the poll, serves as the most unpopular senator up for re-election.Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), another vulnerable Senate Democrat, saw a net seven-point drop in approval rating. Donnelly faces a contentious race against Hoosier businessman Mike Braun.Sen. Menendez, who is†tied in the polls with Bob Hugin in deep-blue New Jersey, was the second most unpopular senator up for election during the 2018 midterm elections. Menendezís favorability fell by eight points, with 46 percent of New Jersey voters disapproving of the incumbent Democratís performance.Morning Consult wrote that Sens. Nelson, McCaskill, Donnellyís popularity dropped below President Donald Trumpís approval rating, ìNelson joined three other Senate Democrats on the ballot next month in Trump-won states ó Claire McCaskill in Missouri, Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Joe Manchin in West Virginia ó in trailing the presidentís net popularity among their constituents.îOther vulnerable Senate Democrats up for re-election, such as Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND),†made the top-ten list for most unpopular incumbents. Forty-three percent of West Virginians disapprove of Manchin, while 44 percent of his constituents approve of the incumbent Democrat. An October survey found that Sen. Manchinís lead in the polls slipped to only four points over West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey.In North Dakota, 43 percent of North Dakotans disapprove of Sen. Heitkamp, compared to 47 percent of voters who approve of Heitkamp.All of these Senate Democratsóexcept for Manchinóvoted against confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. Several polls over the past couple of weeks have detailed how Republicans have skyrocketed in the polls amidst the Democratsí smear campaign of Kavanaugh.These Senate Democratsí popularity plummeted after they all voted against Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, which served as a political risk given that many of them represent states that went for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election.Republicans have seen what some analysts called a ìKavanaugh effectî in which Republicans have seen a surge in donations to Republican groups as well as interest in voting in the November midterm elections.An NBC/Wall Street Journal released recently found that Republicans have nearly matched Democratic interest in the midterm election.The poll†said†that 65 percent of Democrats are ìvery interestedî in the midterm election, compared to 61 percent of Republicans who have also signaled that they are ìvery interestedî in the November elections. The poll has a margin of error of 3.27 percent, which would make the poll a near tie in voter enthusiasm.Glen Bolger, a GOP pollster, said ìSeeing a significant jump in GOP voter interest in the elections this week. The Dem intensity advantage is melting away. Two things: 1. I figure it has to be Kavanaugh effect. 2. Remains to be seen if it lasts. GOP campaigns should not assume their turnout concerns are done.îJosh Holmes, a Republican consultant, tweeted recently, ìLooking at some poll numbers this morning, itís impossible to overstate how important the Kavanaugh hearings have been to voters. Like dropping a grenade into the electorate. Ds in red states are not going to like this.î

Ted Cruz (R-TX) and his wife out of a DC restaurant last month as a ìmob.îìOh, youíre not going to use the mob word here,î Baldwin moaned after the Daily Callerís Matt Lewis brought up the mob that harassed Cruz and his wife.ìA mob is what we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia, two Augusts ago. A mob is not what we saw chasing ó Iím not saying what they did was right.î Baldwin argued.When asked what she would call the people banging on the Supreme Court walls, Baldwin refused to answer. She just mocked her guests by shaking her head and covering her eyes before moving on to another subject.Get ready to roll your eyesÖCNN's Brooke Baldwin is offended that the left's angry mob was calledÖ a mob.Would she rather them be called violent harassers, vandals and criminals? pic.twitter.com/hW9GWvZx5Ió Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) October 9, 2018Later, during his last-place evening show, far-left activist Don Lemon went even further in defending mob action against the political right by framing it as free speech.Again the guest was Lewis and again the example was of Cruz and his wife being intimidated out of a restaurant.ìDon, if they started following you around a restaurant and running you out of places,î Lewis said.Lemon interrupted, ìBut that doesnít mean that people donít get to object. Thatís your right as an American to object. Itís covered in the First Amendment. Itís like the first one!îAfter Lewis continued to press his case that there is a difference between free speech and harassing a man and his wife until you are able to bully them into fleeing a public restaurant, Lemon started screaming at Lewis.Will you let me finish? Matt, please! Let me finish,î Lemon shouted.ìBring it on. Mind if I have a drink?î Lewis asked.ìYou can do whatever you want. You can leave the show if you want,î Lemon fired back.ìIím not going to do that,î Lewis said.ìShut up and let me do it,î Lemon snarled.With the floor to himself, Lemon launched into a full-throated defense of mob action:ìIn the Constitution, you can protest whenever and wherever you want. It doesnít tell you that you canít do it in a restaurant, that you canít do it on a football field. It doesnít tell you that you canít do it on a cable news ó you can do it wherever you want.îìTo call people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right is just beyond the pale,î†Lemon said before cutting to a commercial.This was not the first time Lemon has defended mobs harassing Cruz and his wife.CNNís history of dismissing, inciting, downplaying, or outright advocating in favor of political violence against Republicans and conservatives is a long and sordid one.The anti-Trump outlet has openly called for race riots, frequently defends and even championing the left-wing terror group AntifaÖ And here is a list of more examples, though far from an exhaustive one:CNN also threatens to doxx its critics, openly harasses everyday Trump supporters, and puts Trump in literal crosshairs.As of this writing, Breitbart News has documented over 580 individual acts of violence, harassment, and vandalism, against the political right in just under three years.CNN is seen by many as one of the prime instigators and defenders of this reign of domestic terror.Despite CNNís extremist behavior and tabloid approach to news coverage, the cable channel continues to shed viewers and earn dismal ratings that put it in last place by a wide margin.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

There are 10 Appeals Court nominees before you. Three are out of committee. Will all 10 of those nominees get a vote before the end of the year?GRASSLEY: Well, thereís more than 10. Thereís 41 on the calendar right now, and I think thereís 10 in our committee. And I think hopefully, I get the 10 out of our committee. But McConnell ought to keep the Senate in session until we get all 41 of those judges done. Or if you want to add 10 more to it, add 10 more to it.HEWITT: Iím talking about the 10 Appeals Court nominees, and I am wondering about the Kavanaugh vacancy on the D.C. Circuit. Is there time for a nominee to come out of the White House and be confirmed by the end of the year for the D.C. Circuit nomination, a vacancy created by Brett Kavanaughís promotion?GRASSLEY: If we received it right now, the answer is yes, but just before Christmas. So it kind of depends upon how long weíll be in session. And by the way, Iím not denigrating your efforts to get 10 Circuit Court judges approved, because Iím in favor of them as well.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/10/10/mercedes-schlapp-kavanaugh-debacle-showed-bush-people-how-democrats-attack-one-of-their-own/,"White House Communications Director Mercedes Schlapp speculated that many Republicans have awakened to the nature of the Democrat Party following Democratsí attempt to block the†confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. She offered her remarks in a Tuesday interview with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow on SiriusXMís Breitbart News Daily.Schlapp, a communications alumnus of George W. Bushís 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns, said several ìBush peopleî she knows now adore President Donald Trump.LISTEN:Schlapp said, ìOne of the things that I found fascinating is that during this Brett Kavanaugh debacle for the past several weeks is I reconnected with a lot of the Bush people. These Bush people, a lot of them didnít even vote for Donald Trump.îSchlapp continued, ìI think it was so revealing to them, because Ö [my husband] Matt and I, weíve all been under attack for over two years in supporting President Trump. We have battle scars to prove it, but hereís the deal, these Republicans, they have not been attacked in a way as viciously, and when they saw one of their own, someone who really has lived a really good life, has amazing qualifications, was a public servant for a very long time, someone that was one of their own, the establishment Republicans get attacked in the way theyíve been attacked. Ö One or two of the folks was like, ëWe love Trump. Weíre sold,í and I think thatís whatís happened.îSchlapp went on, ìItís because you had so many of these women who have sons, they come up to me quietly saying, ëOh my gosh, what Iíve seen these Democrats do to Brett Kavanaugh is appalling,í and as the mother of a boy, I never want to see my son go through something like that.îSchlapp said the political battle over Kavanaugh had shown previously uninitiated Republicans that Democrat will use ìwhatever tactic it takes to tear people down.îìThey understand that the Democratsí attack is no longer just for a Trumpian,î assessed Schlapp. ìNo, it means that theyíre going after all of us. Theyíre going after all Republicans.îSchlapp praised Breitbart Newsís audienceís awareness of the nature of Democrats and the broader left.ìThe Breitbart audience has always understood this very clearly, because weíre always under attack,î remarked Schlapp. ìNow itís expanded more broadly, and I think that thereís a realism. I think itís really united Republicans, at this point, and I think itís a very strong message as we go into the next couple of months.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/10/10/hillary-says-misconduct-allegations-against-bill-different-from-kavanaugh/,"Hillary Clinton told the far-left CNN that the sexual misconduct allegations against her husband were different than those against Brett Kavanaugh.The interview was conducted by the left-wing Christiane Amanpour. It was made up of 30 minutes of softballs that allowed Hillary to tee off on whatever she wanted (primarily President Trump) without any tough follow ups.The most outrageous moment, however, came at the end when Amanpour spread some breathtaking fake news. In reference to the Clintons upcoming speaking tour, Amanpour asked:Obviously youíre going to be prepared to have questions about that moment in 1998, the impeachment, the allegations of sexual harassment against your own husband. Are you prepared to answer those questions? Is he prepared to answer them? And how do you see that similar or different from what President Trump is being accused of and Kavanaugh and others today?Before we get to Hillaryís answer, letís look at the questionÖ Amanpour describing the allegations against Bill Clinton as ìharassmentî is like describing an apple as, say, a banana, an uzi as a Dreamsicle, CNN as a legitimate news outlet.Bill Clinton was not accused of harassment. Among other things, he was credibly accused of rape (Juanita Broaddrick), of exposing himself (Paula Jones), and of groping a grieving widow in the Oval Office (Kathleen Willey).Whatís more, over the exposure allegation, Clinton was forced to settle a lawsuit filed with Paula Jones for $850,000, which was $100,000 more than Jones originally asked for.Hereís Hillaryís answer:Thereís a very significant difference. And that is the intense, long-lasting partisan investigation that was conducted in the í90s. If, you know, the Republicans, starting with President Trump on down, want a comparison, they should welcome such an investigation themselves.The ìpartisan investigationî Hillary is obviously referring to is Independent Counsel Ken Starr, who was appointed, not by Republicans, but by three judges on the DC Circuit. Whatís more, he was appointed to replace a man appointed by Clintonís own attorney general, Janet Reno, who launched the special prosecutor Ö at the request of President Clinton himself.And it was Clintonís sleazy Oval office affair with Monica Lewinsky, a much young subordinate, along with the Jonesí suit, and his own act of perjury, that brought his sex life into the Starr investigation.Apparently, Hillary would also like us to believe the now-debunked allegations against Kavanaugh were not partisan, when that is all they were. Accuser Christina Blasey Ford surrounded herself with left-wing, activist lawyers. Donna Ramirez is herself a left-wing activist. Julie Swetnick is the creation of Michael Avenatti, a deeply partisan attorney determined to destroy Trumpís presidency.Kavanaugh not only survived a deeply partisan three week investigation conducted by the establishment media, the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the FBI ó he walked out of it exonerated.On the other hand, Bill Clinton settled the indecent exposure case, was caught lying about Lewinsky, committed perjury, and Broaddrickís rape allegation is about as credible as they come, including contemporaneous witnesses.And what was Amanpourís follow up question after Hillary spewed that nonsense?Hillary Clinton, thank you very much indeed for joining me.This is CNN.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

They are hungry for power, they will stop at nothing,î charged Hawley. ìWe have to defeat them in November. Thatís what this election is all about.îPence said, ìAs Josh Hawley said, the control of the United States Senate could very well come down to the people of Missouri and to this Senate race and it is one of the reasons President Trump and I are so committed to stand with this man of integrity, to stand with this man of principle.îPresident Trump campaigned for Hawley in late September, holding one of his Make America Great Again rallies and promoting Hawley. He told the massive crowd, ìGet out in 2018, because youíre voting for me in 2018î and warned against complacency.Michelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News ó follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook

Clarence Thomas was seen clapping in the room. I donít know if any of the other justices were, but Clarence Thomas, who of course, during his confirmation hearings was also accused of sexual assault, was there clapping, as well.îA September-published article at CNN ó ostensibly a timeline of the FBIís investigation of Anita Hillís allegations against Thomas in 1991 ó makes no mention of ìassault,î ìphysical,î ìthreat,î or ìviolenceî in reference to Thomas. It notes that Thomas was accused of sexual harassment.The New York Times published a similar reminiscence in September, making no mention of ìsexual assaultî ó or physicality of any kind ó in describing allegations made against Thomas.Hillís accusations against Thomas were advanced by Joe Biden ó then a senator from Delaware and chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee ó as cause to oppose Thomasís confirmation. Biden voted against confirming Thomas, who was confirmed with a majority of 52 to 48 in the Senate.CNN markets itself as a politically objective and non-partisan news media outlet, previously branding itself ìThe Most Trusted Name In News.î Itsí current slogan is ìFacts First.î

I have it. I bet a lot of you do too. Some of us talk about it. Others are afraid to, as it could cost them their jobs or their relationships or their sense of control in a chaotic world. In this way itís very analogous to sexual trauma. There is also (as @ladygaga so wisely shared this week) a proven connection between chronic pain and trauma. Therefore, a lot of people- a lot of women- find their pain is activated by weeks like this one. On the day after Dr. Fordís testimony I awoke with a start at 3am.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/09/justice-brett-kavanaugh-hits-the-ground-running-in-first-day-on-supreme-court/,"Newly minted Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Tuesday made his presence felt in his first day on the Supreme Court, peppering counsel with questions amid a ìjovialî mood inside the Supreme Court, according to reports.The new justice dived into his new job, asking a handful of questions in the first arguments of the day following a traditional welcome from Chief Justice John Roberts, who wished Kavanaugh ìa long and happy career in our common calling.îKavanaugh took his seat at the end of bench to Robertsí far left just after 10:00 a.m., a visible manifestation of a moment that Republicans have dreamed of and Democrats have dreaded for decades, with five conservative justices on the court. His path to confirmation was met with immense opposition from Democrats and left-wing groups ó which intensified after Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her, allegations Kavanaugh denied and which the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) found to be uncorroborated.In court, Kavanaugh asked questions of both sides in arguments over increased prison sentences for repeat offenders. He jumped in with his first question after most of the other justices had spoken. Questions from Kavanaugh and Justice Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trumpís two high court picks, suggested they could vote against the Trump administration and side with a criminal defendant from Florida who is fighting an increase in his sentence from just over six years to possibly more than 15 years.In his first-ever question as a Supreme Court justice, Kavanaugh posed the following†query to Denard Stokelingís attorney, regarding†Johnson v. United States:There were no disruptions in the courtroom and the justices laughed at each otherís jokes. Justice Sonia Sotomayor even appeared to playfully pinch Gorsuchís arm as she asked a question about the kind of physical force necessary to have a crime be treated as violent under a federal enhanced sentencing law.The newest justiceís wife and two daughters were in seats reserved for justicesí guests, along with retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kavanaugh replaced Kennedy on the bench. The 53-year-old Kavanaugh occasionally chatted privately with his seatmate, Justice Elena Kagan. From time to time, he put on reading glasses to refer to papers in front of him.There was a long line of people hoping to see Kavanaughís first appearance. Police put up barricades in front of the court, but there were few protesters in the early morning.Kavanaugh has had busy days since he was confirmed Saturday. That evening, he took his oaths of office in a private ceremony at the Supreme Court while protesters chanted outside the court building.On Monday evening, he was the guest of honor at a ceremonial swearing-in at the White House, where Trump apologized on behalf of the nation for ìthe terrible pain and sufferingî Kavanaugh and his family had suffered.†ìOn behalf of the nation, Iíd like to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering youíve been forced to endure,î President Trump said.ìThose who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation, not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception,î he added.Speaking before well-wishers, Kavanaugh said that while the confirmation process ìtestedî him, his ìapproachî remains the same. ìMy focus now is to be the best justice I can be. I take this office with gratitude and no bitterness. On the Supreme Court I will seek to be a force for stability and unity,î he said. ìMy goal is to be a great justice for all Americans and for all of America.îìI was not appointed to serve one party or one interest, but to serve one nation. Americaís constitution and laws protect every person of every belief and every background. Every litigant at the Supreme Court can be assured that I will listen to their argument with respect and an open mind,î the newly minted Justice added.Kavanaugh has also begun moving in to his new office at the Supreme Court, taking over space previously used by Justice Samuel Alito, who moved into offices vacated by Kennedy. Kavanaugh has also hired four clerks, all women ñ the first time that has happened.On Wednesday, the only other day of arguments this week, the court will hear another two hours of arguments. One of the two cases the court is hearing then involves the detention of immigrants, an issue on which Kavanaughís vote could be key.Though he missed the courtís first week, none of the six cases argued dealt with blockbuster issues. They included a case about a potential habitat for an endangered frog and another about an Alabama death row inmate whose lawyers argue he shouldnít be executed because dementia has left him unable to remember his crime. Kavanaugh wonít vote in those cases, but if the court is split 4-4 it could decide to have those cases re-argued so Kavanaugh can break the tie.As the newest member of the court, Kavanaugh will take on a few special jobs. He will take notes for the justices when they meet for private conferences. Heíll also be the one to answer the door at those meetings if someone knocks to deliver something such as a justiceís coffee or forgotten glasses. Further, Kavanaugh will also sit on the committee overseeing the courtís public cafeteria.The Associated Press contributed to this report.†

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/09/poll-independents-overwhelmingly-disapproved-of-democrats-handling-of-kavanaugh-nomination/,"Independent voters overwhelmingly disapproved of Democratsí handling of Justice Brett Kavanaughís nomination, according to a new poll.The CNN/SSRS poll published Monday afternoon showed that 58 percent of independent voters disapproved of the way Democrats handled the nomination, compared to 30 percent of Independents who approved ó a 28-point margin.Independents also disapproved of the way Republicans handled the nomination, but at a lesser 21-point margin.The poll was conducted between Oct. 4-7 among a sample of 1,009 respondents, with a margin of error of†+/-3.8. The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh on Saturday, Oct. 6.Republicans are hoping Kavanaughís confirmation has helped to energize the conservative base and expose Democrats for their strong-arm tactics to keep President Donald Trump from naming a new justice to the Supreme Court.Republicans have argued that Democrats were the ones who leaked the confidential letter from Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, for their own political gain.They have also argued that Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, held on to Fordís letter since July and had kept it secret until right before the committee was set to vote on Kavanaugh.The allegations of sexual assault threw Kavanaughís confirmation into question at the last minute, prompted a public and emotional hearing with Ford and Kavanaugh, and prompted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) to call for a last-minute FBI investigation into her allegations.They also led to other accusers coming forward, including a woman represented by TV Resistance lawyer Michael Avenatti, who claimed that Kavanaugh was present at parties were she had been gang-raped. The woman, Julie Swetnick, walked back many of her claims in a MSNBC interview later.Republican senators said the FBI investigation had no new information to corroborate claims of sexual assault, and the Senate voted to confirm Kavanaugh 50-48.CNN Senior Political Commentator and former Republican Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said Sunday he thought the way Democrats handled the nomination hurt them with Independents.ìI think for many†independents†they are not ignorant to the fact that that was caused by the Democratic Party leaking this information and bringing forward someone who didnít want to be out there, who didnít want to be testified before Congress, but was used as a political pawn to do so,î he said on CNN State of the Union on Sunday.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/10/09/minnesota-teacher-resigns-after-posting-call-to-kill-kavanaugh/,"A Minnesota teacher has resigned from her position after allegedly making a Twitter post encouraging someone to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.ìSo whose [sic] gonna take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh?î the unnamed teacher allegedly†posted following Kavanaughís confirmation to the Supreme Court.The teacher was originally placed on paid leave pending an investigation by Rosemount, Minnesotaís Independent School District 917 into her post, but has since reportedly resigned.ìOn Sunday, October 7, 2018, the district began receiving complaints regarding an employee,î explained Independent School District 917 Superintendent Mark A. Zuzek. ìThe actions of the employee did not occur at school, and there were no school devices, equipment, or other school staff involved in the actions. At no time were students or staff in danger. The employee was placed on paid administrative leave and an investigation conducted.îLast month, before Kavanaughís confirmation to the Supreme Court, it was reported that ì#KillKavanaughî had become a top Twitter search suggestion.ìTyping ëkillí into Twitterís search function currently returns a shocking result at the top of its search suggestions: ë#KillKavanaugh.í Itís also currently the third autocompleted suggestion in searches for ëkií and the fourth suggestion in searches for ëkí as of this writing,î reported Breitbart Tech Senior Reporter Allum Bokhari. ìThatís right ó by typing a single letter into search, Twitter is suggesting that its users might be interested in a hashtag about the murder of a federal judge and SCOTUS nominee.îAt the time, Twitter did not respond to an email from Breitbart News about the search suggestion.In September, actress Rosie OíDonnell claimed voting for Kavanaugh was a ìvote to kill women,î and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY)†claimed ìwomen will dieî if Kavanaugh was confirmed.Sen.

Ed Markey (D-MA) said the confirmation of †Supreme Court Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh will be ìthe single most powerful animating force,î to especially woman voters in the upcoming midterm elections.On the Republican base, Markey said, ìItís not as galvanized as the Democratic base. Itís not as galvanized as those who were outraged at the way in which Dr. Blasey Ford was treated before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the entire process for the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh. What we are seeing here is a historic uprising, especially of women in our country who really do feel that this president has to have a check be placed upon him. Otherwise preexisting conditions, which are protections for those who have health care needs, or the entire Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade can all just be swept away. It can be completely overturned by Brett Kavanaughís vote on the Supreme Court. This is going to be a referendum on Donald Trump, on Brett Kavanaugh, on the key votes, which he can now cast, that undermines protections for women in our country and families in general.îHe added, ìDonald Trump is, I think, in a small minority of people who think Dr. Blasey Fordís accusations were a hoax. I think she was highly credible. I think across this country, people know that she was sincere. She was absolutely fearless in coming forward even though there would be huge negative consequences for her personally. I think the real hoax now that is attempting to be perpetrated is by Donald Trump that will contend there was nothing to any of these accusations made about Brett Kavanaugh. I think the American people know who watched that process very closely over a two-week period know that is not the case. He doesnít have the temperament or the credibility to serve on the Supreme Court, and that will be the single most powerful animating force for the next 28 days across this country. There is an uprising of people who will get to the polls. We lost when we should not have lost, and there is nothing more motivating than that in politics.î(h/t Grabien)Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

She added that she had no intention of challenging Trump for the presidency in 2020. She added that she would be campaigning for Trump re-election.Nevertheless, without offering anything other than ìsources close to the White House,î which are not sources ìinî the White House, which means those sources could be virtually anyone willing to tell a so-called journalist what she wants to hear, the unverified and illogical narrative was spread that Haley might have resigned in disgust over the successful confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.From the far-left Washington Post:Sources close to the WH echo this sentiment ó that the timing doesn't make sense.

The allegations of sexual misconduct against the now-Supreme Court Justice were nearly 40 years old. Whatís more, they were all debunked.Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who is much more moderate and closely aligned with the feminist movement than Haley, voted to confirm him, as did four other female Senators.As of now, there is not a single women within the Republican establishment who believes Trump and the Senate put a man on the Supreme Court guilty of anything other than liking beer as a teenager.Even Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), the one Republican who voted against Kavanaugh, said he was a good man.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/09/vulnerable-democrat-congressman-on-kavanaugh-the-democrats-i-thought-went-a-little-bit-too-far/,"Rep. Tom OíHalleran (D-AZ), a vulnerable Democrat seeking re-election in Arizonaís first congressional district in 2018, bucked his partyís leadership in public commentary on Monday evening in a television interview where he criticized Democrats for going ìtoo farî with their opposition to now Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.Speaking about Kavanaugh, OíHalleran said his party ìwent a little bit too far.îìThe Democrats I thought went a little bit too far,î OíHalleran said. ìWeíre supposed to ask probing questions.†I donít like it ó I never did like it ó when people got up there and pontificated time and time again about their position.†This is supposed to be about a discussion back and forth between you and the nominee.îOíHalleran is one of the Democrats from swing districts in the country that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is counting on to retake the Speakerís gavel in Novemberís midterm elections, and scant polling on this race shows his Republican challenger Air Force veteran Wendy Rogers a few points ahead of him. OíHalleran is an ally of Pelosi, and voted for her to remain as Majority Leader at the beginning of this Congress when he first won his election, per a local news report at the time:While he voted for Pelosi, OíHalleran said it was evident at the meeting that the caucus was ready for a change and for leadership to be more responsive to members.ìThe underlying agreement was that thereís a need to change some of the ways weíve been dealing with the caucus,î he said.So, for OíHalleran to now come out against his partyñPelosi was just as vicious to Kavanaugh as Senate Democrats wereñon this matter shows yet again just how deeply negative the effect of fierce Kavnaaugh opposition has been on Democrats as they seek to take the House majority away from Republicans for the first time since the 2010 midterm elections.WATCH DEMOCRAT TOM OíHALLERAN ON HIS PARTYíS MISHANDLING OF BRETT KAVANAUGH:Holding this very rural Arizona district is critical to Democratsí chances in November. If they are going to take the net 24 seats they need to claim from Republicans, they cannot afford to lose districts like this one in November. There are precious few GOP pickup opportunities in the country. Others exist in places like Minnesota, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, but for the handful of GOP opportunities to take seats away from Democrats there are dozens of opportunities for Democrats to take seats from Republicans.Rogers, OíHalleranís GOP opponent, appeared on Breitbart News Saturday this weekend, breaking down just how radical OíHalleran isñand the stakes at play in this election.ìMy opponentóa first-term incumbentóhas gone along with the liberal agenda. He voted against the tax cut, he would most assuredly vote for impeachment of our president. He tries to cast himself as moderate, but heís anything but,î Rogers said.ìHe actuallyóI donít even know how you do thisóhe started off as a Republican, then became an Independent, and now heís a Democrat,î Rogers added. ìHeís all over the map, trying to be all things to all people.îìOur entire nation is hanging by the slender thread that runs through the House of Representatives, is the way I look at it, and the way all of my voters look at it,î Rogers said. ìThe feeling in my district is that we are at a pivot point, that the future of the country rests on whether or not our president is going to remain president. I tell people, we have the Supreme Court, we have the Senate, we have the presidency, but if we donít hold the House, we are in for a justóa complete devolution and degradation of due process because of exactly what was on display this past week.î

Who are promising to pack the Supreme Court with more justices?Those Democrats?Those Democrats seriously believe they are playing by the rules and need to become even more ruthless?Already, and with the silent (and sometimes not-too-silent) approval of Democrats, Breitbart News has documented over 580 individual acts of violence, vandalism, harassment, and threats aimed at Trump supporters.Already, and with the silent (and sometimes vocal) approval of the Democratsí allies in the establishment media, over 580 acts of ruthlessness have been committed against Trump supporters during the Trump era.The Politico article continues:Whether Trump knew it or not, his remarks were perfectly pitched to stoke anxieties that have haunted many top Democratic operatives for a generation: the fear that their party loses big power struggles because Republicans are simply tougher, meaner, more cynical and more ruthless than they are.If after all of the above, Democrats fear they must become even more ruthless to obtain power, I guess we now know why they are so desperate to abolish the Second Amendment.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Well, it just turns out, it just so happens that Monica McLean worked for a Preet Bharara, the former U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, now a virulent anti-Trump critic on television and former counsel to Chuck Schumer.îHe continued, ìSo, I strongly suspect that Chuck Schumerís political operation knew about Ms. Fordís allegations as far back as July and manipulated the process all along to include taking advantage of Ms. Fordís confidences and directing her towards left-wing lawyers who apparently may have violated the D.C. code of legal ethics and perhaps may face their own investigation by the D.C.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/josh-hawley-claire-mccaskills-radical-democrat-party-seeking-to-undo-missourians-2016-vote/,"Senate challenger to Claire McCaskill Josh Hawley alerted voters Monday about the urgency of keeping radical Democrats in 2018 midterms from undoing what Missourians voted for in 2016.ìThe confirmation progress of Justice Kavanaugh was an unprecedented smear campaign and unlike anything weíve ever seen in American history or in American politics,î Hawley told reporters on a Monday press call. ìTheir attack on the institution of the Supreme Court is an unprecedented effort to delegitimize the basic institutions of American government, an entire branch of American government, Article III of the Constitution.îìIt is a radical, radical agenda that gets more aggressive by the day,î said Hawley, a ìradical attempt to seize power and undo the 2016 electionÖî He said the future turns on the Missouri Senate race.Hawley said he Missourians have expressed tremendous frustration over Democratsí actions during the confirmation of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States. ìWhat Iíve heard from people over and over is they cannot believe this smear campaign that the Democrats mounted,î he said. He added they canít believe Sen. Dianne Feinstein withheld the letter of Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford ìfor months on end in order to get a circus-like atmosphere and hearing in order to derail this nomination.îìItís been a terrible stain on the United States Senate and I think voters are going to punish those who have engaged in the smear campaign at the polls, and that includes Claire McCaskill,î Hawley said of Democratsí actions during the Kavanaugh hearings.ì[Senís] Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, [Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris] have made this agenda very clear and of course we know what their broader agenda is: open borders, allegiant military, higher taxes on the middle class, government-run health care, and now the impeachment of President Trump and Justice Kavanaugh,î said Hawley.ìThe Democrat Party wants to undo everything the people of Missouri voted for in 2016 and they couldnít be more open about it,î he went on. He called McCaskill a proven ìpartisan ally and reliable supporterî of those senators. He said Schumer has ìspent more than $15 million to boost her election hereî and that she has voted with Schumer 90 percent of the time.He said Democrats know ìThey cannot win power in congress without Claireís victory in November here in Missouri. This is an unprecedented power grab by Democrats in Washington.îAsked if he thinks McCaskill has laid off criticism of Trump as the election draws near, Hawley responded heís seen McCaskill ìridicule Trump in the most personal terms.îOne reporter asked Hawley if he agreed with President Donald Trumpís recent comment regarding accusations against Kavanaugh, ìItís a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of.î Hawley resolved, ìIn American politics at least, Itís a very scary time for the rule of law.îìIt should be very, very, very worrisome to Americans of good will, whatever political background, that this is what Senate Democrats are willing to do in order to seize power,î said Hawley.†He later criticized McCaskill: ìShe would not say a word to stop the smear campaign, she would not say a word against her party.îMichelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News ó follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2018/10/08/panthers-anthem-kneeler-reid-says-kavanaugh-appointment-unacceptable/,"Maybe the Carolina Panthers thought newly-signed safety Eric Reid wouldnít kneel during the anthem, like he did in San Francisco.After all, on March 22, the San Francisco Chronicleís Eric Branch, reported after talking to the then-free agent safety, that ìReid also said he does not intend to kneel during the anthem this season.îìIím just going to consider different ways to be active,î Reid told Branch during an event at Stanford University. ìDifferent ways to bring awareness to the issues of this country. To improve the issues happening in this country.îPerhaps the operative word is ìconsider,î because before his first game with the Panthers, on Sunday, he knelt during the anthem.Why did he kneel before the Panthers 33-31 win over the New York Giants? Because he feels the nation still has work to do on racial injustice and police brutality, the two issues that started the movement in 2016, led by former 49ers QB Colin Kaepernick. Reid, who is close with Kaepernick, knelt during the anthem during the 2016-17 seasons in San Francisco.Reid isnít trilled with the state of the country right now, including the appointment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Saturday.ìThis morning, I found out the officer that killed Tamir Rice was re-hired,î Reid said. ìI feel like thatís unacceptable. (Brett) Kavanaugh was voted into the Supreme Court ó thatís unacceptable. I feel like our country is moving backward, and the only way to change that is to keep talking about it, to keep raising awareness. Keep doing what weíre doing.îFormer Cleveland police officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice in 2014, has been re-hired by another Ohio police department. A grand jury didnít indict Loehmann in the shooting of Rice.Why Reid feels the Kavanaugh appointment is ìunacceptableî is unclear because wasnít asked to explain his opposition.Panthers coach Ron Rivera, son of a career military officer, and known for his patriotism, isnít interested in talking much about his new player kneeling during the anthem.ìIím not going to talk about a guy exercising his First Amendment Rights,î Rivera said after the Giants-Panther game. ìIím going to talk about what happens on the football field.îSome legal scholars argue the First Amendment doesnít apply to protesting at work.ìThe players are entitled to kneel if the owners allow them to,î Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz told AM-970 in New York. ìNow the owners could say ënoí because the players donít have a First Amendment right in relation to the owners. They only have a First Amendment right in relation to the government.îHow did the Carolina fans react to Reid kneeling during the anthem?ìSome fans in attendance Sunday left the game when Reid took a knee,î wrote Brendan Marks of the Charlotte Observer.Shelley Wiggins of Gastonia was one of the fans who left.ìI mean, I understand he feels like heís doing something noble, but to teach a generation of children to hate the police and America is not the right way to fix the problem,î Wiggins told the Charlotte Observer.Reid believes his critics are missing the point.ìPeople who donít want things to change, people who want to maintain the status quo, this is the only thing they can do,î Reid said. ìThey have to subvert, they have to distract, they have to redirect from what weíre trying to accomplish, and the only way to do that is to try to alter the narrative. We have to stay strong, we have to stay diligent, to make sure that that narrative doesnít change. We, as a country, have fallen short.îItís unclear if signing Reid will make the Panthers fall short at the box office. Perhaps not, since most fans have already paid for their 2018 season tickets.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/brett-kavanaugh-confirmation-process-tested-me-did-not-change-me/,"Justice Brett Kavanugh took the Judicial Oath as an associate justice of the Supreme Court Monday at the White House, administered by the man whose seat he now fills and for whom he once clerked, retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.Kavanaugh became a justice formally on Saturday in a small private ceremony, but Mondayís oath-taking allowed him to address the country for the first time since being confirmed 50-48 in Saturdayís final Senate floor vote. Speaking after President Donald Trump, Kavanaugh sought to move past the historically unprecedented tactics that Democrats unleashed on him during the confirmation process and put to rest notions of his being controversial, biased, or partisan.Kavanaugh called his confirmation process ìcontentious and emotional,î but added later, ìAlthough the Senate confirmation process tested me, as it has tested others, it did not change me. My approach to judging remains the same.îìThat process is over,î Kavanaugh continued, ìMy focus now is to be the best justice I can be. I take this office with gratitude and no bitterness. On the Supreme Court I will seek to be a force for stability and unity. My goal is to be a great justice for all Americans and for all of America.îìI was not appointed to serve one party or one interest, but to serve one nation. Americaís constitution and laws protect every person of every belief and every background. Every litigant at the Supreme Court can be assured that I will listen to their argument with respect and an open mind,î the new Justice went on, repeatedly stressing a judgeís role as an independent ìumpireî and not a policy maker.Earlier in his address, Justice Kavanaugh stressed the Supreme Court;s non-political nature and sought to stress that he would not upset that tradition. He told the crowd:I am honored to serve alongside all of my new colleagues, each of whom I know, and each of whom I greatly admire and deeply respect. All nine of us revere the constitution. Ö The Supreme Court is an institution of law. It is not a partisan or political institution. The Justices do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle. They do not caucus in separate rooms. The Supreme Court is a team of nine and I will always be a team player on the† team of nine.ìAs in the past, our nation faces challenges and divisions, but I am an optimist,î Kavanaugh said in conclusion. ìI live on the sunrise side of the mountain. I see the day that is coming, not the day that is gone. I am optimist about the future of America and the future of our independent judiciary.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/phil-bredesens-last-minute-statement-on-kavanaugh-hurting-him-in-tennessee-with-far-left-base/,"Former Gov. Phil Bredesenís last-minute statement on Friday that he would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court has cost him votes among his far left base in Tennessee.The statement by the Democrat nominee for the U.S. Senate seat in Tennessee was made on the last day a CBS Poll was in the field (from October 2 to October 5). That poll shows him losing to his Republican opponent, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN-07), by eight points, 50 percent to 42 percent. It also came one day before Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate, and two days before pop star Taylor Swift endorsed him over Blackburn in the November race to replace retiring Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) in the U.S. Senate.The CBS Poll showed the Republican crossover on which he has been counting is already in decline, a function of his inability to separate himself from the far left policies and actions of Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who recruited him to run for the Senate seat.Last month, Bredesen declared that, if elected, he would not vote for Chuck Schumer as leader of the Democrats in the Senate. That statement was met with widespread derision in Tennessee, given the close relationship the two men have and the fact that Schumerís PAC has spent millions of dollars to support his candidacy.Bredesenís handling of the Kavanaugh nomination has not helped his cause.In contrast to Blackburn, who announced her steadfast support for Kavanaugh from the day President Trump nominated him to the Supreme Court on July 9, Bredesen has maintained radio silence on where he stood on Kavanaughís nominationñand the unfair smears and ìsearch and destroyî tactics deployed by Senate Democratsñduring the months of July, August, and September.In his statement on Friday, Bredesen said,îI was prepared to say ëyesí to his nomination prior to Dr. Fordís coming forward. While the subsequent events make it a much closer call, and I am missing key pieces of information that a sitting Senator has, Iím still a ëyes.í îBredesen made no mention of the unfair treatment Kavanaugh received at the hands of Senate Democrats during the confirmation process. Instead, he claimed that Kavanaughís accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, had been treated unfairly by the Senate:Dr. Ford is a heroine, and has brought forcefully into the national conversation the many barriers women face in reporting and dealing with sexual harassment and assault. I was disgusted by the treatment she received at the hands of the Senate and am determined to help bring about a fairer and far more respectful treatment of these issues.The former governorís attempts to thread the needle on the Kavanaugh nomination has fallen short on both sides of the aisle, but particularly among far left Democrats, as the Chattanooga Times FreeñPress reported that late Friday:Chattanoogan Randy Price [a Democrat], who is running in Tennesseeís state Senate District 11 contest in Hamilton County, called Bredesenís announcement ìdisappointingî in a tweet and soon followed up with a far sharper jab:ìSo you are saying lying to the Senate and serious partisanship arenít disqualifying?î Price said of Bredesenís stance on Kavanaugh, who had angrily denied allegations of sexual improprieties while in high school and college from three women, including Ford. ìYou need to rethink your position or job application.îPriceís ìjob applicationî dig was a reference to a frequent Bredesen video ad tagline in which he says ìIím applying for the job.îTennessee Democratic Party Chair Mary Mancini issued a statement, hours after being contacted by a Times Free Press reporter, in which she said: ìLet me be clear: We stand with the survivors of sexual assault and abuse.ìToday, Governor Bredesen released a disappointing statement based on imperfect and limited information as a result of a flawed and secretive process,î Mancini added.Sundayís announcement by Swift that she is endorsing Bredesen is viewed in Tennessee as an attempt by Bredesenís allies to bury his support for Judge Kavanaugh in the memory hole and restore enthusiasm for his candidacy among his far left base.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/alaska-gop-party-chair-murkowski-faces-very-significant-response-over-kavanaugh-opposition/,"Alaska Republican party officials are weighing plans to punish Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) for voting against the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.The party has asked Murkowski to provide any information she may want its state central committee to evaluate as it considers whether to reprimand the lawmaker. Party Chairman Tuckerman Babcock says the committee could decide to issue a statement condemning†Murkowski or withdraw support from the senator. Futher, Babcock could encourage†party officials to search for a replacement and request that she not seek re-election as a Republican.Read the state partyís full statement on Murkowskiís opposition to Kavanaugh:We are both shocked and disappointed by the decision of US Senator Lisa Murkowski to oppose the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh. The Alaska Republican Party supports his confirmation. We respect the process, but after the process ran its course, the time came for the Senate to do their duty and advise and consent, or not. We expected many Democrats to remain adamant in opposition to the nomination by President Trump. We did not expect Republicans to end in opposition. Werepeat, we are both shocked and disappointed by the opposition to the confirmation from just one Republican, Senator Murkowski.This is a very significant vote. And the Alaska Republican Party will have a very significant response. However, it will not be the response of one man. As Chairman, while I have the authority under our Rules to speak on behalf of the Party, this issue is just too significant. How we respond as Republicans will be brought before the entire grassroots leadership of the Party: the State Central Committee. As representatives of 140,000 members of the Alaska Republican Party, we will consider what action to take. We will deliberate, and discuss and then vote on exactly what our response will be to her vote against confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court.After remaining undecided on whether Kavanaughís nomination should move forward, Murkowski rendered her decision Friday in dramatic fashion. As the clerk read the names in alphabetical order, all eyes were on Murkowski. Senators stood up in their chairs and voted, some of them loudly.But when it came to Murkowski, she stood up, paused, and whispered ìno,î her voice barely audible.Then she took her seat, looking down with a stone-faced expression.As the end of the vote neared, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who sits next to Murkowski, leaned over and put her hand on the arm of Murkowskiís chair. The two huddled in deep conversation.Collins and Murkowski are the only GOP senators who support abortion rights, a crucial issue in the debate over Kavanaughís nomination. If confirmed, Kavanaugh could tip the courtís balance toward conservatives for a generation. Collins said Kavanaugh assured her during a private meeting that Roe v. Wade, the ruling that established abortion rights, is settled law.Murkowskiís decision brought a swift response from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who insinuated that she might mount a primary challenge against the senator if she opposes Kavanaugh.Palin, who was GOP presidential candidate John McCainís running mate in 2008, tweeted, ìHey @lisamurkowski ó I can see 2022 from my house.î The tweet referenced an infamous Saturday Night Live skit in which Tina Fey, portraying Palin, said she could see Russia from her house. Murkowski is next up for re-election in 2022.Hey @LisaMurkowski ñ I can see 2022 from my houseÖó Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) October 5, 2018Murkowski acknowledged she agonized over her vote, telling reporters she didnít make up her mind until she walked into the Senate chamber.ìThis has truly been the most difficult evaluation of a decision that Iíve ever had to make, and Iíve made some interesting ones in my political career,î the Republican senator said.Over the weekend,†President Donald Trump told the Washington Post†that†Murkowski will ìnever recoverî from voting against Kavanaugh. ìI think the people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did,î he said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.†

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/nuclear-option-everything-the-democrats-tell-you-about-the-merrick-garland-nomination-is-a-lie/,"In this shameful season of partisan lies, it is nearly impossible to run down every deceit before it lands on the lips of some lusty mob, where it becomes a rallying cry to chase decency, dissent and free speech from the public square.Look at this weekendís mobs of protesters ó many of them paid by hugely wealthy and powerful special interests ó that thronged the streets around the Capitol and Supreme Court to shout down any difference of opinion. Jackbooted hippies jeered, harassed and intimidated anyone who hesitated to swear fealty to their warped worldview and twisted lies.No single lie has been more freely uttered ó or is more profoundly dishonest ó than the claim that†SenateDemocrats had every right to kill the Kavanaugh nomination as payback for Republicansí refusal to take up President Obamaís nomination of Merrick Garland in the final months of his presidency.Letís set aside for the moment this insidious notion that it is somehow acceptable to publicly endorse revenge politics.The fact that so many Democrats openly embrace this kind of ìgoverning by revengeî reveals just how cynical and disingenuous the entire party has become. It also reveals just how unlikely they will ever be any part of a genuine effort to stop the insanity gripping Congress these days.The biggest lie about Merrick Garland ó one that is constantly peddled by Democrats and unquestioningly accepted by the press ó is that Republicansí treatment of him and his nomination is somehow on par with how Democrats treated Justice Kavanaugh and his nomination.Nothing could be further from the truth.If you go back and consult the Constitution, you will remember that the president is charged with nominating Supreme Court justices. The†Senate†is charged with providing ìadvice and consent,î meaning confirmation or rejection.Merrick Garland was nominated to the Supreme Court at a time when American voters had expressly put Republicans in charge of the†Senate. If voters wanted Mr. Obama to have a free hand in selecting a Supreme Court nominee in his final two years in office, they would have elected Democrats to control the†Senate.They did not. As such, a majority of the†Senate†declined to confirm Merrick Garland. That is democracy at work.Democrats also like to suggest that the filibusters they waged against President Bushís lower court nominees ó and virtually every Republican Supreme Court nominee since then ó are no different from what Republicans did to Merrick Garland.Again, a complete lie.Merrick Garland suffered the lawful will of a Republican-led†Senate. Filibusters against judicial nominees, on the other hand, are carried out by rogue insurgencies inside a†Senate†minority, preying on the long-outdated mannerly customs of a collegial U.S. Senate.By definition, filibusters are not expressing the will of the elected†Senate. Rather, filibusters thwart the will of the†Senate†by a guerrilla minority.In other words, Democrats hijacked the†Senate†and handed it over to ìtyranny of the minority.îNo one spreads these lies more shamelessly than†Senate†Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has done more than anyone else to turn the courts into an ideological battlefield.In a rare departure from his usual dishonesty, Mr. Schumer offered a sobering message after Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed.This fight, he said, can be ended at only one place: the ballot box.Indeed. And Republicans had better not forget that.ï Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/kirk-republicans-just-started-winning-they-cant-be-tired-of-it-yet/,"ìÖand dying in your beds, many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days, from this day to that, for one chance, just one chance, to come back here and tell your enemies that they make take your lives, but theyíll never take your freedom!î ó Mel Gibson as William Wallace in the movie BraveheartWith the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, the Republican political establishment has done something it is not actually used to doing. It won. It isnít that Republicans have never won before, it is just that they typically win by forfeit.On the rare occasion that Democrats calculate they donít have the necessary numbers, and that the issue isnít important enough for them to spend political capital, they walk away and Republicans end up winning the same way a junior high school team wins when the other teamís bus runs out of gas. They didnít really beat them, they won on a technicality.With Kavanaugh, however, there is no asterisk next to the Republican ìW.î They faced an all-out assault from the Democratic Party and all the sinister characters that operate in its hidden and nefarious underworld. The Democrats emptied their bench, pulled their goalie, threw a greased pitch, placed cork in their bats, and even let some air out of footballs (enough sports metaphors?). The Democrats played their best game. They also cheated.And they lost. They arenít used to losing. They never lose in these battles. Republicans donít play to win.But Donald Trump always plays to win and he is teaching Republicans how much fun it can be to play that way.It isnít hard to imagine that, in the not-so-distant past, if the Republicans had found themselves facing the offensive mounted against them, against Brett Kavanaugh, and against their constituents who put them in office, that they would have turned to a different Republican President and quietly counseled him to get Kavanaugh to voluntarily withdraw himself from consideration.You can picture the scene. There would have been a solemn statement to the press, Kavanaugh at the microphone saying how it was just too much for his family and because of his love of the nation and the need for it to heal he felt it best to step aside. Behind him would be a cast of dour-faced Republicans, each looking as if they had just been told they were going to have to sit through eight consecutive hours of opera.Instead, Republican lawmakers could be scene on the Senate floor this past Saturday looking like they were all auditioning for the role of the Cheshire Cat. There were even salacious rumors of laughter, high-fives, and chest bumps (none of those from Justice Kavanaugh).During the 2016 campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump said in a tweet, ìRepublicans donít know how to fight and win ó I will teach them!î Well class has been in session for almost two years and Republican Senators just passed their midterms.I actually think he is doing something more than teaching them how to win. I believe he is teaching them to hate to lose. That can be an even greater motivator for people in general and politicians in particular. The Democrats hate to lose, and they are filled with hate right now.The President is also reinforcing how he will support those joining the fight. When Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) gave her inspiring speech on the floor of the Senate Friday, and then followed it up with a ìyesî vote on Kavanaugh Saturday, President Trump took to Twitter to praise her courage. This despite Sen. Collinsís frequent criticisms of the President over the last two years.Converts to ìwinningî are welcome.Until this past Saturday, the Republicans in Washington had been behaving as though they were so afraid of the Democrats they were unwilling to exploit their numerical advantages. Despite having a majority in both the House and the Senate, the Republicans have repeatedly acted as though they were hopelessly outnumbered and that by aggressively challenging the Democrats and the pop-culture infantry that serves them would simply place their members at too great a risk of loss.Now these formerly timid Republicans have joined President Trump and the real resistance movement. This past week, they were willing to fight and resist the Democrats attempt to derail and destroy Constitutional process, due process, civil process, and moral process.And they won.President Trump warned us just before the election in 2016 that he was going to make sure America started winning. He said we would win, win, win and we would keep winning until Americans got tired of winning. Exhausted, we were going to protest that we couldnít win anymore. He said he was going to encourage us at that moment to keep winning so we could make America great again!Well, it took a while, but the Republican Party just started winning. They figured it out just in time. We are less than one month away from an election that will determine how much their President, the man who is coaching them on how to win, is able to accomplish over the next two years. They ought to be able to build some momentum from the Kavanaugh victory.They canít be tired of winning yet. Letís hope they are just getting started.Charlie Kirk is the founder and president of Turning Point USA.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/10/08/cnns-acosta-trump-knows-all-about-mobs-he-encourages-them/,"Monday on CNNís ìNewsroom,î network chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta said President Donald Trump knew ìwhat mob rule and mob tactics look like†because he encourages them.îAcosta said, ìItís pretty remarkable what heís saying, Brooke. We should point out, a few minutes before you came on the air, he was making additional comments at this law enforcement speech that heís giving down in Orlando, Florida. He was talking about the battle over Brett Kavanaugh and some of the allegations that were brought forward. And he said, quote, ëIt was a disgraceful situation brought about by people who are evil.í So the president is putting this in some very stark ó I mean just the most pointed terms possible. It is unclear, Brooke, whether or not the President is lumping in the accuser in that Brett Kavanaugh saga, Christine Blasey Ford, into that comment when he says that this was brought forward by people who are evil. If you talk to people inside the White House, inside the Republican party, obviously in the Democratic side, they all believe Christine Blasey Ford, to the point where she says she was sexually assaulted. Where there seems to be a huge divide is that people like Susan Collins and so on say while they believe Christine Blasey Ford, was assaulted, they donít believe that Brett Kavanaugh committed that act.îHe continued, ìBut it is rather striking, Brooke, to hear the president continue this battle, almost as if he wants it to continue. And weíll see some of that later on this evening when the president hosts an event over here at the White House in the East Room, where Brett Kavanaugh will be brought out in front of the cameras and announced as the next Supreme Court justice. This is the victory lap that theyíre looking for over here at the White House. The way this is being framed in the most stark political terms possible, it does raise the question whether or not the president is trying to go too far with some of this rhetoric, you know? His talk of mob rule and so on, I mean, Brooke, have you been to a Trump rally?îHe added, ìYou do hear rhetoric at those rallies that would conjure up images of a mob. Go back to the 2016 campaign when the president said as a candidate that he would like to punch protesters in the face and so on. So perhaps the president knows what mob rule and mob tactics look like because he encourages them himself.îFollow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Itís hypocrisy run rampant. The Constitution would not permit impeachment of a sitting justice for actions he took while a private citizen 35 years ago, nor, I think, would it permit using the laws of perjury, which are very tough. They have to be about a material fact that has to have been a deliberate lie, not forgetfulness, not a boast, not an exaggeration, but a willful, deliberate lie about a material fact.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/kevin-cramer-heidi-heitkamp-flushed-bipartisan-brand-vote-against-brett-kavanaugh/,"Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) told Breitbart News Sunday that Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) ìflushedî her bipartisan brand with her vote opposing Judge Brett Kavanaughís nomination to the Supreme Court.Congressman Cramer, who hopes to unseat Heitkamp in the North Dakota Senate race, told Breitbart News Sunday host Amanda House that Sen. Heitkampís vote against Judge Kavanaugh on Saturday tarnished her brand as a bipartisan lawmaker.ìPolitically speaking, it plays very well for me. I will tell you I was perhaps the most surprised person in America when she decided to vote ìno.î I was certain she would vote ìyes.î She was running her entire campaign on the brand that sheís the most bipartisan senator from North Dakota; she can reach across the aisle,î Cramer told Breitbart News. ìShe likes to fasten herself as pro-Trump most of the time. She says that she votes with him; heís right for North Dakota.îìThat effort to brand herself [as bipartisan] was flushed in one voteî the North Dakota Republican added:Cramer also said many North Dakotans told him that Heitkampís vote against Kavanaugh was the ìdeciding factor for them to vote forî him.Sen. Heitkamp also admitted recently that her vote against Kavanaugh was not a ìsmart political moveî adding, ìThatís the way it just goes.îIn contrast, Rep. Cramer said the ìpolls are showing from a margin of two-to-one they wanted Brett Kavanaugh to become Justice Kavanaugh.îHeitkampís support continues to plummet in recent polls. In a Fox News poll, Cramer leads against Heitkamp by 12 points, whereas in a September poll, Cramer only led by 4 points.The Fox News poll also found that if Heitkamp were to vote against Kavanaugh, 34 percent would be less likely to vote for her, whereas only 17 percent would be likely to vote for her.The North Dakota Republican said, ìShe voted with Chuck Schumer instead of Donald Trump in North Dakota.îBreitbart News Sunday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Eastern.

Phil Bredesen†is running to fill the vacancy created by retiring Republican Senator Bob Corker. Bredesenís Republican opponent is Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who has been surging in the polls.Using her Instagram account, Swift wrote, ìAs much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me.îShe went on:[Blackburn] voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives.Using his Twitter account, Bredesen thanked Swift. ìIím honored to have your support and that of so many Tennesseans who are ready to put aside the partisan shouting and get things done.îBut Swiftís timing could not have been worse. Bredesen had just come out in support of confirming Kavanaugh to the highest court, and two influential left-wing groups immediately came out swinging against him: MoveOn.org and Priorities USA.Both claim to have withdrawn their support, including †a ìsix-figure digital video ad expenditure for Phil Bredesenî that is now canceled ìdue to his Kavanaugh position.îNo word yet from Swift on if she will withdraw her support.In the two most recent polls, Blackburn is up +5 and +8.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Now you have people like Senator Collins saying well, she was sexually assaulted, but it wasnít Brett Kavanaugh with no basis for her to make that assertion. Now you have President Trump is essentially insulting every survivor in this country and frankly sending a message that people shouldnít come forward by saying it was made up. Heís showing his true colors.îHe added, ìThese midterm elections are always dominated by the energy in opposition to the party that is in power. That is Donald Trump, and thatís not going to change because of whatís happened.îHe continued, ìItís important Democratic voters feel like their energized to come out and vote for Democrats. If the Democrats are constantly trying to tack themselves off the Republicans and have a national message designed to protect one red state Senate race, theyíre not going to energize the base of voter they need to take back the House. Thatís the main event in the midterm election. I think the fact that Democrats supported survivors and held Kavanaugh to account and frankly revealed him to be the rabid partisan he is, that is what voters need to see to get energized to come out and vote for Democrats. Either because they want a different alternative to President Trump or even if they are sympathetic to Trump they want to make sure thereís a check in a divided government.îOn Taylor Swift endorsing Democrats, Rhodes said, ìI donít think one celebrity makes that big a difference. What I do think it might represent, though, thatís more important, is women voters. You know, younger women voters turning out in bigger numbers. Frankly, white women swung the election to Donald Trump in 2016. And contrary to what Mitch McConnell is saying and a kind of Washington parlor game, I think you see in the number of people running who are women on the Democratic side, the survivors who are coming forward, the Womenís March. I think we could be surprised at the scale of the turnout among women including younger women in this country in the midterm elections. I think itís more interesting to me that sheís coming forward as a woman and making those points than coming forward as a celebrity. Because I think thatís part of the trend, weíre seeing in our national politics.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/michael-avenatti-brett-kavanaugh-fruit-basket/,"Not only should Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh (man, I love writing that) send Michael Avenatti a fruit basket, we all should because without him, America might be in a much darker place today.There is no reason to reiterate what it would have meant had the obscene smear campaign against Kavanaugh succeeded, had sexual McCarthyism won the day. But there were two counter-intuitive turning points in this bruising 18-day battle that are worth looking at.The first was President Trumpís decision to mock Christine Blasey Fordís testimony at a Mississippi rally last Tuesday.Ford accused Kavanaugh of attempting to assault her at a 1982 house party, and after her Senate testimony, the unwritten rule demanded everyone believe she was guilty only of fingering the wrong man. Sorry, no. In my opinion, she lied, and I have tons of documentation to back up that opinion.But no one supporting Kavanaugh dared talk about this, and the unwillingness to discuss inconvenient truths about Fordís story put the confirmation in real danger.Enter Trumpzilla.When the president stood before the world and mocked Fordís memory lapses, while it may have ìdisgustedî and ìappalledî some, it also shifted the narrative. Hoping the viral clip would sway a handful of then-undecided senators to vote against Kavanaughís confirmation, the corrupt media broadcast the clip endlessly for 36 hours. But the tactic backfired, just as Trump knew it would.All at once, the spotlight was off of Kavanaughís yearbook and virginity and on the gaping holes in Fordís testimony. This mattered Ö bigly.And then there is Mr. Avenatti, the FameMonster brought to life by tabloid outlet CNNÖThe porn starís lawyer stepped on the biggest rake of them all.Let me explain to you what the media and Democrats (pardon the repetition) had plannedÖ We will call it The Sunday Night Blitz.After Ford came forward, everyone assumed that if we made it through the following weekend without a second accuser, Kavanaugh was home free ó because one accuser with three named witnesses who sided with Kavanaugh was not going to be enough to disqualify him.As the sun set on Sunday night, and just as we were beginning to exhale, Mr. #MeToo dropped his precision-timed bomb. Ronan Farrow was supposed to take Kavanaugh out. Using his own clout and Deborah Ramirezís allegation that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken 1983 dorm party, this was meant to be the kill shot. One of three things was now supposed to happenÖ1) Knowing he was doomed and sick of the whole process, Kavanaugh would surrender. 2) Trump would cut bait in the hopes of getting someone else over the finish line before the midterms. 3) A couple of lily-livered GOP senators would pull their support, which would doom everything.In other words, the left pushed all their chips into the middle of the table. But there were a couple of problems.The first is that the Farrow story was a joke. Although it was expertly crafted to present her ludicrous allegation into the aforementioned kill shot, Ramirezís accusation was even weaker than Fordís. All of Ramirezís so-called witnesses bolstered Kavanaughís claim that he was innocent. (This included Ramirezís best friend in college). Whatís more, Ramirez admitted to being ìfoggyî drunk on the night in question. We later learned she had been calling around admitting she could not remember who the culprit was.The second and much larger problem for Democrats was Mr. Michael Avenatti.Mere moments after Farrow delivered his kill shot, Avenatti bumbled all over it by parachuting in like a lummox on meth, hoping to steal Farrowís thunder and secure the 2020 Democrat presidential nomination.Like something out of a movie titled Lex Luthor: Mall Cop, Avenatti floated down into a field of rakes while screaming, ìGANG RAPIST! GANG RAPIST!îAnd just like that *snap* the whole scheme was exposed. It was even more exposed when all of the establishment media proved they were in on the conspiracy by taking Avenattiís outrageous claims seriously, even though he had not yet produced his alleged victim, Julie Swetnick.This is when all decent people realized the fix was in, the frame was on, and the assassination of Brett Kavanaugh really was a left-wing plot.In other words, Avenatti overplayed his hand, and by doing so, exposed that it was all a big, fat bluff.To the surprise of no one, this was only further exposed a couple days later when Swetnick finally did come forward. Her sworn statement about Kavanaugh spiking punchbowls so he and his friends could run gang rape trains on incapacitated women was hot garbage.And her subsequent NBC interview, where she basically recanted everything in her statement, was the best evidence ever presented against The Matriarchyís fascist talking point about ìBelieve All Women.îAnd that right there is the rub, the undercurrent, the subtext of this disaster. The FameMonster they built destroyed their conspiracy by unwittingly dropping Democrats and their media allies into a ìBelieve All Womenî box.As fascist and un-American as it is, ìBelieve All Womenî is a pretty solid talking point, at least until one of the women we are supposed to believe is accusing someone of being a serial rapist based only on the fact she ìsaw him byî a punch bowl and that he ìdefinitely huddledî with other boys.Would Kavanaugh had been confirmed without Avenattiís pratfall?We will never know for sure.But based on her own speech, Avenattiís Lex Luthor: Mall Cop routine was a major turning point for the one person who mattered ó Susan Collins.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/ronna-romney-mcdaniel-kavanaugh-confirmation-battle-completely-energized-gop-voters/,"Republican National Committee (RNC) chairwoman†Ronna Romney McDaniel on Sunday told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace that Republican voters are ìcompletely energizedî after a successfully hard-fought battle to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgWaXVqJN3EA partial transcript†is as follows:WALLACE: The fight over the Kavanaugh confirmation seems to have energized Republican†voters. I want to take a look at a poll. In a poll in July, 78 percent of Democrats said that the November elections are ëvery importantí compared to 68 percent of Republicans. In a new poll, a ten point enthusiasm gap has now shrunk to two points. 82 percent for Democrats, 80 percent for Republicans. What is it about the Kavanaugh confirmation process that you think has mobilized your voters?MCDANIEL: I think itís been a culmination of things. The Democrats have doubled down ëresist and obstructí the past two years. This [the Kavanaugh confirmation process] has brought all of this to the forefront ó the protests, the interruptions during the hearings and now with this smear campaign of Judge Kavanaugh, holding these allegations to the eleventh hour. I think Republicans have woken up and said ëListen, itís a very clear choice, do we wonít resist, obstruct, delay, dysfunction in Washington?í They are also seeing the results, 3.7 percent unemployment, four million new jobs in this country. Itís a pretty clear choice which partyís delivering and which party is obstructing.WALLACE: Some analysts say that this new energy, what Senator McConnell called a political gift of the Kavanaugh case, will help you more in Senate races, in state-wide races, than it will House races, particularly in suburban†districts. A recent†Quinnipiac Poll, when voters were asked the generic ballot question ëwho do you back in your House district?í 49 percent said the Democratic candidate, while 42 percent said the Republicans. So, itís still plus seven for the Democrats. Is the Kavanaugh bump, if there is any, playing differently in House and Senate races?MCDANIEL: Itís not. Itís helping across the board. The generic ballot has narrowed from double digits. Now itís at seven. Iím looking at every race across the country. We have about 30 that are in the margin of error, certainly in districts†where Hillary Clinton won where we have Republican incumbents. Our job is to turn out our base first. Our base is completely energized right now. The Kavanaugh hearings have just highlighted how important this election is for them.†

Bill Nelson (D-FL) has an F-rating from the NRA and wants many new gun controls, including a national database of all firearm sales and firearm owners.The Miami Herald reports that Nelson has an F-rating from the NRA and supports an ìassault weaponsî ban and barring 18-20 year olds from exercising their Second Amendment rights to purchase long guns.Nelson also opposes national reciprocity for concealed carry. This opposition means your Second Amendment rights stop at your stateís border in Nelsonís mind; that you have no right to carry a gun for self-defense in any state but your state of residence.Breitbart News reported that Nelson also supports universal background checks. Such checks outlaw private gun sales, criminalizing a neighbor for selling a gun to a neighbor or a co-worker for selling a gun to fellow employee.Universal background checks require a national gun registry in order to be enforceable, and Nelson is already on record supporting a national database of all gun sales and gun owners. In 2014 he co-sponsored the Crime Gun Tracing Modernization Act, a bill intended to create a ìsearchable database of the importation, production, shipment, receipt, sale, or other disposition of firearms.îNelson voted against confirming pro-Second Amendment Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court but the NRA-ILA reports he voted for Barack Obamaís ìanti-gun nominees to the Supreme Court ñ† including†Sonia Sotomayor, who signed a Supreme Court opinion saying that Americans do not have an individual†right to own firearms.îAWR†Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host†of the Breitbart podcast†Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of†Down Range with AWR Hawkins,†a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/nancy-pelosi-rallies-colleagues-after-kavanaugh-loss-dont-agonize-organize/,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is attempting to boost morale among her Democratic colleagues in the wake of the fight over Justice Brett Kavanaughís confirmation by urging them to ìOWN OCTOBERî and win a majority in the November elections.The letter, dated Sunday, October 7, tacitly acknowledges that Democrats are dejected after failing to stop Kavanaugh ó and that Republicans are enjoying a massive boost in voter enthusiasm that could help the GOP retain Congress in the midterms.A new survey of battleground districts published by the†Washington Post on Monday shows that Democrats only enjoy a narrow edge in the race to control the House of Representatives, 50% to 46% (with a margin of error of 2%).The letter, obtained by Politico, exhorts Democrats not to give up:We must not agonize, we must organize. People must vote. What is at stake in this election is nothing less than the health and financial security of families across America. The new conservative majority on the Supreme Court threatens a rollback of protections for people with pre-existing conditions, more leverage for corporate special interests over working families, and little hope to reform CitizensUnited. That is why we must fight even harder to win so that we can advance our For The People agenda:lower health costs and prescription drug prices;raise workersí wages with strong economic growth by rebuilding America;clean up corruption to make Washington work for the people.In stark contrast to the GOP Congress, our Democratic agenda will be conducted with openness and accountability to the people, fairness to everyone, and solutions that bring us together.With the majority, we will strengthen the Congress to the vision of our Founders: Article I, the first branch of government, a check and balance on the executive and judiciary.To achieve this, we must OWN OCTOBER with our For The People agenda, which I hope you will advance in events and on social media in the weeks ahead.Thanks for your leadership.Curiously, the original letter includes abrupt changes in font and a glaring capitalization error.On Sunday, Pelosi also sent a fundraising email urging recipients to ìnever forget and never forgiveî over Kavanaughís confirmation.Pelosi hopes to return as Speaker of the House if Democrats win a majority ó a position she held from 2007 to 2011, amidst much controversy.Joel B.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/donald-trump-returns-campaign-trail-supreme-court-win/,"President Donald Trump will host four campaign rallies this week, triumphantly celebrating his successful appointment of conservative Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and energizing Republican voters for the midterm elections.On Tuesday, Trump will campaign in Iowa; on Wednesday, he will travel to Pennsylvania; on Friday, he will go to Ohio; and on Saturday, he will host a rally in Kentucky.Each of the states is considered ìTrump countryî ó states that he won in the presidential election and where he hopes to lend energy to Republicans running in the congressional midterm elections in November.Trump has a list of achievements to celebrate, including Kavanaughís appointment, a historic renegotiation†of NAFTA with Canada and Mexico, and the lowest unemployment numbers†in 49 years.The president demonstrates great energy for the campaign trail, already hosting nearly two dozen campaign rallies in critical states for Republicans.ìPeople say, ëWhere do you get this energy?íî Trump said in Pennsylvania last week. ìYou know where I get it? If you love doing it, itís easy. If you donít like doing it, not so good!îHis approval ratings hit 51 percent in a recent Rassmussen poll of registered voters, tying a record he set for 2018 in May.Trumpís biggest concern is history. The opposing political party typically takes back power in the midterm elections as the party in power gets complacent.Recent polls, however, show increased Republican†enthusiasm for the midterm elections as a result of the contentious Kavanaugh confirmation process.ìThe only reason to vote Democrat is if youíre getting tired of winning,î Trump said†to his supporters on Saturday. ìWe want to win, win, win!îAfter the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings brought out the worst in the left, Trump argued that the Democrats cannot be trusted with power.ìYou donít hand matches to an arsonist, and you donít give power to an angry left-wing mob, and thatís what theyíve become,î Trump said in Kansas on Saturday. ìThe Democrats have become too extreme and too dangerous to govern.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/08/media-conspiracies-about-brett-kavanaughs-yearbook-debunked/,"The establishment media have been spreading conspiracy theories about Brett Kavanaughís yearbook for more than three weeks. Now those conspiracies have been fully debunked.Yes, Kavanaughís confirmation fight is over, but the autopsy exposing the establishment mediaís lies must continue.There are three entries in the now-Associate Supreme Court Justiceís high school yearbook from 1983 that Democrats and their media allies told us proved that Kavanaugh was a drunken serial rapist:1) ìFFFFForther of Julyî ó† an acronym for gang rape: ìFind them, French them, Feel them, Finger them, F*** them, Forget them.î2) ìDevilís Triangleî ñ A†threesome†with one woman and two men. In other words, two men exploiting and abusing a woman as piece of meat.3) ìHave You Boofed Yet?î ó ìboofî being slang for sex.During his testimony last week, Kavanaugh was asked about all three and claimed they were perfectly innocent in-jokes among high school buddies.He testified that ìFFFFFî referred to the memorable way a friend in his group said the word ìfuck.îìDevilís Triangle,î Kavanaugh said, was a drinking game like Quarters.ìBoofedî is a reference to flatulence.So what you have here are a bunch of high school guys using their yearbook to forever document their silly jargon.Naturally, though, no one on the left believed him, and as the sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh began to collapse, in order to defeat his nomination, the media were forced to invent perjury charges. The laugh-out-loud claim was that Kavanaugh had risked his reputation, career, and prison to cover up juvenile in-jokes.On cable news, online, over social media, and in the newspapers, to say the elite media were dedicated to framing Kavanaugh as a perjurer, would be quite the understatement. Over and over and over again, now that smearing Kavanaugh as a sexual predator had failed, the media would disqualify him for drinking beer in high school and lying about farting as an adult.Well, after days and days of endless smears, we finally learned the truth, and the truth is that Kavanaugh told the truth.No less than the New York Times debunked the ìFFFFFî controversy on Wednesday. Buried deep in a pathetic exposÈ about a 1983 party Kavanaugh planned (impressively, I would add), the Times writes:When he drank, Mr. Garrett would stutter words that began with the letter F. It became such a joke that many football teammates, including Judge Kavanaugh and Mr. Garrett himself, had ìFFFFFî references in their personal yearbook pages.Washington Post reporter Charles Lane corroborated a key part of Kavanaughís explanation for the origins of ìFFFFF.îSince it's come up ó I grew up across the street in Chevy Chase from the guy known as ""Squi"" and saw him every day in my childhood. He did not stutter, so nothing to mock in that dept. but he did have that funny way of saying the F-word, as BK said. FWIW.ó Charles Lane (@ChuckLane1) September 27, 2018On Thursday, the ìDevilís Triangleî conspiracy theory was finally put to bed when four former Kavanaugh classmates issued sworn statements confirming that it was indeed a drinking game.ìIf the phrase ëDevilís Triangleí had any sexual meaning in the 1980s, we did not know it,î they wrote under penalty of felony.One of the letter writers, Bernard McCarthy, wrote in his yearbook that he invented the name ìDevilís Triangle,î which is contemporaneous proof of its meaning. A total of six people have corroborated this.Another sworn statement from a former classmate debunked the ìboofî conspiracy theory.A simple search of Google Books found that ìboofî is indeed slang for passing gas.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

In my life, I donít just mean in character.îìIím like, ëYeah, fuck yeah, me, me. Me, white male Christian, American, straight. Number one!í That is a dark feeling, because it is indulging in an appetite for yourself, itís very possessive, itís very consumptive, itís pornographic, and so the confession is: Yes, I have these feelings as well. But the question is: Why are those feelings indulged in America?î he told the magazine.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/07/pollak-everything-in-moderation-including-moderation-in-brett-kavanaugh-fight/,"The Senateís moderates were the stars of the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation battle. With the slender Republican majority ó just one vote on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and two votes in the Senate overall ó the moderates held unusual influence.They showed both the positive and negative side of moderation ó the way in which swing votes compel both sides to work together, or create more opportunities for partisan bickering. And they also showed that moderation has its limits ó even for moderates.Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) provided a shining example of moderation at its best. Her valediction on the Senate floor Friday was so careful, pragmatic, and convincing that even the New York Times ó otherwise livid at Kavanaughís confirmation ó had to acknowledge that she made an excellent case. She also played the theatrics of the moment perfectly: by leaving the country in suspense as to which way she would vote, she ensured that the whole nation would pay close attention to her arguments.Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), by contrast, showed moderation at its worst. She took a wishy-washy middle position that had little philosophical or intellectual justification. Caught between two sides, Murkowski made herself vulnerable to sentimental persuasion by survivors of sexual assault ó whose experiences, while compelling, had nothing to do with the facts of the case before the Senate. In the end, Murkowski broke with the Republicans without earning any respect across the aisle for doing so.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) showed that moderation can take great courage, when oneís own party has run to the extreme. True, Manchin may also have had self-serving motives: in voting to confirm Kavanaugh, he was siding with the majority of the conservative West Virginia electorate, with just weeks to go before a tough re-election. But he also stood up to incredible pressure from a left-wing mob that was literally standing outside his office and screaming at everyone who entered and left.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) showed that while moderates can be frustrating, they can also be helpful. Because he held the swing vote on the committee, he was able to dictate the process, insisting on a week-long supplemental FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh even after the special hearing. Republicans were hugely irritated, but when the inquiry ó predictably ó turned up nothing, it became clear that Flakeís gambit had given Kavanaughís appointment new legitimacy.Finally, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) showed that while moderation has its uses, it also has its limits. He was in a unique position to make the case for Kavanaugh after having voted to confirm both Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, telling fellow Republicans ìelections have consequences.î When Democrats failed to reciprocate that civility, Graham blasted them for what they had done. He cast his moderation aside and became one of Kavanaughís most forceful advocates, rallying his partyís base.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/10/07/jordan-peterson-kavanaugh-should-step-down-from-supreme-court-to-have-his-name-cleared/,"Professor Jordan Peterson argued this weekend that Brett Kavanaugh should step down from the Supreme Court for a ìless divisiveî nominee to take his place, despite Petersonís past advice to ìnever apologize to a mob.îIn a tweet, Peterson chimed in on a tweet by Eric Weinstein that criticized Brett Kavanaughís upcoming appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States. ìIf confirmed, Kavanaugh should step down,î Peterson tweeted.The tweet came in response to a thread by former Evergreen State College Professor Bret Weinstein, who called Kavanaugh an ìentitled punk.îMy position on the #Kavanaugh confirmation: Both outcomes are completely unacceptable.ó Bret Weinstein (@BretWeinstein) October 5, 2018ìMy position on the #Kavanaugh confirmation: Both outcomes are completely unacceptable,î Weinstein wrote. ìKavanaugh was clearly, at the very least, an entitled punk through college.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/07/dems-latest-scheme-balance-supreme-court-by-adding-two-liberal-judges/,"NEW YORK ó Following the confirmation of President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh, some Democrats and progressive activists are shifting tactics, pushing a scheme to ìpackî or ìbalanceî the Supreme Court by adding two new seats to be filled by liberal judges. The Supreme Court expansion plot would be enacted if Democrats retake Congress and the presidency in 2020, according to the plan.On Saturday, Viceís West Coast editor Harry Cheadle referenced the plot in a piece titled, ìWeíre Watching the Slow Poisoning of the Supreme Court.îHe wrote:Chatter of impeaching Kavanaugh was floating around, and some have taken to imagining a scenario where the Democrats retake Congress and the White House in 2020 but have their progressive legislation blocked by the Supreme Court. The only way forward then, the argument goes, would be appointing extra justices to ìpackî the courtóa scheme proposed by Franklin Roosevelt in response to a similarly right-wing Supreme Court in the 30s (FDRís plan was rejected by Congress, but the court became friendlier to his policies anyway).On Sunday, Vox.com featured an interview with political scientist David Faris, who advocated in a recently published book for Democrats to pack the Supreme Court with as many liberal judges as they can. Farris branded the plan the ìneutron option for the Supreme Court.îCheadle himself previously summarized Farisís arguments thusly:[It] would involve first proposing a constitutional amendment to end lifetime tenure on the court and pushing a proposal to let each president pick two justices per term, a compromise that Faris hopes would ìend the court wars.î He suspects Republicans wouldnít go for that, however, so heíd advise the next Democratic president to just ìpackî the court as FDR tried to do in 1937 before Congress rose up against him and prevented it. That would involve passing a bill to expand the size of the court and allowing the president to appoint however many justices would be needed to create a new liberal majority, with the friendly Senate signing off on any appointee. (This would be legal, Faris points out, because thereís nothing in the Constitution stipulating the size of the court, which has in fact fluctuated in the past.)Indiana Law professor and podcaster Ian Samuel, meanwhile, advocated for such a plan to become a new progressive catch phrase, tweeting, ìëPack the courtsí should be a phrase on par with ëabolish ICE.'îHuffington Post senior reporter Zach Carter followed with a piece titled, ìHey, Democrats: Pack The Court.î ìëEleven Justicesí is the next ëAbolish ICE,íî was the subtitled of the article.Writing at NBC.com on Sunday, political science professor Scott Lemieux opined that ìDemocrats are now much more likely to mobilize against an even more conservative court.îHe continued:But how might Democratic leaders respond?ÖA more likely scenario ó especially if a Trumpified Supreme Court not only effectively overrules Roe v. Wade but then keeps striking down legislation passed by the next unified Democratic government ó is expanding the size of the Supreme Court. The constitution does not fix the size of any federal appellate court, and the number of justices can be changed with simple majorities of both houses of Congress. Doing so isnít hypothetical: After the Civil War, congressional Republicans manipulated the size of the court to ensure that it wouldnít interfere with Reconstruction.On Thursday, Bustle.comís Caroline Burke asked, ìWhy Are There 9 Supreme Court Justices?îBurke noted that ìpacking the courtî might ìsound kind of revolutionary, mostly because of the stigma around the Supreme Court as an institution that is above partisan politics, not to mention the notion of justices having life terms on the bench.îBurke continued:But the number of Supreme Court justices isnít a foundational American tenet, like termed presidencies. Itís just a law ó and more and more, intellectuals and thought leaders are raising the idea of packing the courts as the only solution to ensuring the continuation of progressive legislation in coming years.Last month, activist attorney Michael Avenatti advocated for the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate to add two seats to the bench and expand the Supreme Court to eleven seats, ostensibly by picking additional liberal judges.ìThe Dem nominee must commit to this or not receive the nomination IMO,î Avenatti tweeted about his proposal. ìThere is far too much at stake.îAlso last month, British journalist Mehdi Hassan wrote in the Intercept that following the nomination of Kavanaugh it is now ìpast time for liberals and the left to consider court packing: When they next have control of the House, the Senate, and the White House, Democrats should add at least two new seats to the Supreme Court and then fill them, ideally, with left-wing, well-qualified women of color. They could even call it ëcourt balancing.íîThe far-left Daily Kos blog issued a ìwarning for Republicansî that if Kavanaugh is confirmed, a ìfuture government controlled by Democratsî is ìlikely to pursue that optionî ñ referring to ìcourt packing.îIn July, Yale Law School professors Ian Ayres and John Fabian Witt laid out the case in the Washington Post for expanding the Supreme Court, referring to the tactic as ìcourt balancing.îìDemocrats need a Plan B for the Supreme Court. Hereís one option,î their oped was titled.The duo advocated for Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to announce a plan aimed at ìbalancingî the Supreme Court if the Democrats can win a majority in Congress and take the presidency in the 2020 election.Ayres and Witt note the Constitution does not stipulate the Supreme Court must have nine seats and they reference historical precedent for expanding the nationís highest court:The court originally had six seats. It expanded and contracted in the first half of the 19th century, then settled on nine. It has remained there since 1869, partly as a political norm and partly to preserve competitive equilibrium.ÖAt crucial moments in U.S. politics, parties have acted to change the size of the Supreme Court. Often the tactic was a political power play. But sometimes it was undertaken for the good of the country, as during the Civil War, when the Republican Congress in 1863 added a seat to the court in part to protect the success of the war effort against formidable legal challenges.The Democratsí court-balancing proposal for 2020 should commit the party to expanding the size of the Supreme Court by appointing two new federal judges who, by statute, would be designated to sit on the court for 18 years; thereafter, the constitutionally required life tenure would be served in lower federal courts.While pushing their proposal under the banner of ìbalancing,î the Yale professors do not disguise their goal of packing the court with two new liberal judges:If Democrats took control of Congress and the presidency in 2020, the new administration would effectively have two Supreme Court slots to fill immediately. The party should commit to nominate one liberal (say, the liberal analog of Justice Neil M. Gorsuch) and to fill the other spot by renominating the liberal-centrist Garland himself.Ayers and Witt were referring to the nomination of Merrick Garland, who was the pick of Barack Obama, then a lame duck president, to fill the slot left vacant following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.LA Times journalist and blogger Michael Hiltzik pushed a similar plan in a piece titled, ìHow a new court-packing scheme could save the Supreme Court from right-wing domination.îThe Economist last month also referenced the possibility of Democrats ìpackingî the Supreme Court:The judgments of a court seen as just another nakedly political body, no different from Congress or the presidency, can easily be dismissedóor fought. Franklin Roosevelt mulled packing the court in the 1930s when it frustrated his New Deal ambitions. It is not hard to imagine a Democratic president and Congress doing the same in four yearsí time, if five Republican-appointed justices repeatedly strike down the ambitious social programmes these politicians promised.Aaron Klein is Breitbartís Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). Senators invoked cloture by a vote of 51-49, made possible by the ìnuclear optionî put in place by former Sen.

Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) and was accused of posting personal identifying information for Senators Lindsay Graham (R-SC), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), and Mike Lee (R-UT).

President Donald Trump, who beat his Democrat rival Hillary Clinton†by 77 electoral†votes (304-227) in the 2016 presidential election, has placed Neil†Gorsuch†and†now†Kavanaugh†on the†court. Both Justice†Samuel Alito and John Roberts were selected†by†President George W.

In a September 2017 interview with CNN, Clinton told host Anderson Cooper that she believed the process was outdated and needed to be replaced.†ìWeíve moved toward one-person, one-vote, thatís how we select winners,î said Clinton. ìI think it needs to be eliminated. Iíd like to see us move beyond it, yes.îOne year later, Clinton once again called for the electoral college to be eliminated in an opinion-editorial for the Atlantic, arguing President Donald Trump was a racist who was damaging†American democracy.ìYou wonít be surprised to hear that I passionately believe itís time to abolish the Electoral College,î Clinton wrote.†ìTrump has sunk far below the already-low bar he set for himself in his ugly campaign.îìHate speech isnít ëtelling it like it is,íî she added. ìItís just hate.î

Surabian offered his remarks in a Saturday interview with Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matthew Boyle on SiriusXMís Breitbart News Special.Surabian described Democratsí and leftistsí behavior in opposing Kavanaugh over recent weeks as a ìgood thingî for Republicans.ìThe one good thing about what happened over the last couple of weeks is [Democrats] ripped off the mask of moderation and revealed the face of radicalism to the American people,î remarked Surabian. LISTEN:Surabian continued, ìThe average American watching this clown show, this disgrace, is probably more motivated to show up and vote in November. Ö All the polling shows that they are now more likely ó these people who have witnessed this are now more motivated today to vote who werenít motivated before this ó [to be] motivated to vote for Republicans.îSurabian added, ìThe good news for us, the good news for Republicans, the good news for Trump supporters is that we werenít the only people who have seen this. The entire public saw it. All American people saw it.îSurabian went on, ìThey saw the disgraceful action of Dianne Feinstein and what she did by waiting until the last minute to drop the accusation. They saw the circus that was the hearing the other day. They saw the media class clapping like lemmings for everything the Democrats accused Kavanaugh of. They saw them eating it all up like the lap dogs that they are.îSurabian concluded, ìSo what was once a hidden bias, what was once behind the scenes is now open for everyone in the country to see for themselves. The Democrat Party today is not the Democrat Party of our grandparents. The Democrat Party today is a radical leftist ó almost socialist ó party that doesnít give a crap about doing whatís right. They donít care about honor. They donít care about integrity. They care about power. That should scare every single person.îSurabian warned, ìThe first thing Democrats will do if they take Congress in November is reopen the investigation and try to impeach Justice Kavanaugh.îSurabian urged Republicans to learn to ìfight backî following the battle over Kavanaughís nomination.ìThis is an even bigger moment for the Republican Party, because itís the moment in time where the Republican Party finally realized that if we are going to defeat the left, if weíre going to defeat the media, if weíre going to defeat the Democrats, then we have to fight,î opined Surabian. Surabian went on, ìThis wasnít a time to back down. This wasnít a time to roll over. This was a time to start throwing haymakers, and thatís exactly what we did, and now we stand here today with a new Supreme Court justice.îSurabian cautioned Republicans and conservatives against complacency following Saturdayís confirmation of Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice.ìKeep on fighting,î said Surabian.

She denied Republican charges her office leaked Fordís letter accusing Kavanaugh of sexual assault to the press. Kavanaugh denies her allegation.ìAt no point did I or anyone on my staff divulge Dr. Blasey Fordís name to press. She knows that and believes it, for which Iím grateful,î Feinstein said Monday. ìI find it interesting that the same critics who last week condemned me for not releasing Dr. Blasey Fordís letter against her wishes are now suggesting I did leak the letter.îFeinsteinís inarticulate denial only further raised suspicions†that the California†Democrat did indeed leak to the letter ó even drawing the ire of† President Donald Trump, who imitated her unconvincing rebuke during a Wheeling, West Virginia, rally last week.† ìDianne Feinstein, did you leak? Remember her answer. Did you leak the document?î President said before launching into an imitation of Feinsteinís denial. ìUh, uh, what? No. Uh, no. I didnít leóuh. Uh, wait one minute. Did we leóoh, oh. No, no, we didnít leak it.îìIíll tell you what. That was really bad body language. Who knows,maybe she didnít, but that was the worst body language†Iíve ever seen,î he added.In a press conference Thursday, Feinstein criticized†the FBIís handling of its seventh background check into Kavanaughís past, alleging†the probe appeared to be a ìproduct of an incomplete investigation that was limited, perhaps by the White House.îì[W]hat I can say is that the most notable part of this report is whatís not in it. As we noted by the White House, the FBI did not interview Brett Kavanaugh, nor did the FBI interview Dr. Blasey Ford,î Feinstein told reporters.†What weíve heard, from numerous people, over the last few days, seeking to provide information to the FBI, we have seen even more press reports of witnesses who wanted to speak with the FBI, but were not interviewed.†Deborah Ramirezís lawyer said he was unaware of any corroborating witnesses who were interviewed.îDespite Feinstein and her Democrat colleaguesí best efforts to thwart Kavanaughís nomination, the Senate voted to confirm the Trump court pick 50-48, and was sworn in shortly after by Chief Justice John Roberts and retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.The Associated Press contributed to this report.†

This is what we do not want to go back to. And with this confirmation, with the great booming economy, with safer communities, with a stronger military, with rolling back regulatory bureaucracy, I donít think the American people are going to want to go back to see Nancy Pelosi become Speaker of the House or Maxine Waters become a committee chairman over their banking industry,î he said.Budd said Kavanaughís confirmation has fired up conservatives and the base.ìTheyíre waking up and realizing that midterms are just as important as the presidential years for elections,î he told Breitbart News Saturday host Matt Boyle.ìThis is a battle about those who want to stand up for the truth, [but] itís larger than just conservatives or Republicans ó itís a battle for the truth.î

Today was a major step in the journey to restore the Constitution to its rightful and intended role in our Republic,î Family Research Council President Tony Perkins announced Saturday.ìToday is a victory for liberty in America.

Justice Kavanaugh will serve with distinction as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States for years to come,î Heritage Foundation President Kay Cole James said in a Saturday†statement.Kelly Shackelford, President, CEO, and General Counsel for First Liberty Institute, highlighted Kavanaughís commitment to religious liberty, the First Amendment, and his ìrespectî for the court as why he was the right choice for the Supreme Court:As a law firm dedicated to defending religious freedoms, we are thrilled that Judge Kavanaugh has finally been confirmed to the Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh has a solid history and commitment to protecting the religious freedoms and First Amendment rights of our citizens and has demonstrated in his many years on the bench a deep respect for the proper role of the judiciary.But many conservatives acknowledged the path to nomination was not easy, given that Kavanaugh had to overcome many obstacles from leftists and Senate Democrats looking to sink his nomination.ìHistory was made today as Brett Kavanaugh overcame an unimaginable smear campaign to be confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court,î said Perkins. ìFor the first time in decades, this nominationóhis nominationóbrought with it the reality of returning to a truly constitutionalist court. Many on the Left couldnít stand such a thought. And for that, he and his family have paid a tremendous price.îìThis is an outstanding achievement for President Donald J. Trump, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, who overcame the Democratsí obstruction and delay strategies and confirmed Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,î Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund Chairwoman Jenny Beth Martin said Saturday, thanking all the senators who voted to confirm Kavanaugh to the nationís highest court.Some groups decided to investigate the Senate Democrats who tried to bring down Kavanaughís nomination.Tom Fitton, president of the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, vowed to investigate anti-Kavanaugh senators for violating Senate rules throughout Kavanaughís confirmation process:We are grateful that a majority of the Senate rejected the leftist smears, abuse of process, and rejection of constitutional norms. Now there must be accountability for this lawless assault on our constitutional republic. Judicial Watch has launched an investigation into the Senate ethics and legal abuses by anti-Kavanaugh Senators. And we will continue to pursue our Senate ethics complaint against Sen. Booker for his admitted violation of Senate rules, the violation of which requires expulsion from the Senate.The Senate confirmed Kavanaugh to serve on the Supreme Court in a 50-48 vote on Saturday afternoon, giving conservatives the upper hand as the shift in the balance of power on the court could potentially make this the most conservative Supreme Court since 1937.

Susan Collins ñ who often has been at odds with the pro-life base of the Republican Party because of her support for Planned Parenthood and its taxpayer funding.ìTo the senators who endured threats for doing what is right, thank you,î Nance said. ìThank you to Sen. Susan Collins who stood up for all women in that historic speech yesterday. To the staff on the hill who dealt with angry mobs at your desks, thank you.îFather Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said the senators who voted to confirm Kavanaugh ìhave done the right thing by placing such an eminently qualified judge, with such an impeccable record, on the High Court.îìThis is truly a great day for America, and brings the judiciary closer to what the founders intended,î he added, ìA branch of government that applies the Constitution and the laws, rather than re-writing them.îPavone continued:This confirmation process was the low point in American politics, and placed on full display the way that todayís Democrat party is willing to engage in character assassination, distortion of oneís record, and childish smear tactics in order to advance its political agenda. It was and should remain profoundly disturbing that so many in public offices have discarded the basic legal premise of†innocent until proven guilty.Pro-life leaders also expressed gratitude to President Donald Trump for nominating Kavanaugh.ìThank you, President Trump, for choosing such an outstanding and exemplary nominee,î said Nance.Mancini echoed her gratitude to Trump ìfor delivering on his campaign promise to nominate a fair and independent judge who faithfully adheres to the Constitution.îPavone added he is ìgrateful to President Trump for nominating Judge Kavanaugh and standing with him.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/kimberly-guilfoyle-if-democrats-win-2018-you-wont-recognize-this-country/,"America First Policies Vice Chairwoman Kimberly Guilfoyle warned of Democrat congressional majorities making America unrecognizable. She offered her remarks during a Saturday interview with Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matt Boyle on a SiriusXM Breitbart News Saturday Special.Boyle asked Guilfoyle to describe the stakes of 2018ís forthcoming November midterm elections.ìYou mentioned that [Democrats] are already talking about trying to impeach Kavanaugh,î said Boyle. ìWe know that they want to impeach Kavanaugh. They want to impeach Trump. They want to impeach every part of this whole administration. They want to undo everything the voters did. Can you put into perspective for us just how big the stakes are if Nancy Pelosi gets that speakerís gavel?îGuilfoyle responded, ìYou wonít recognize this country. Thatís the problem. They are just subversive elements, all the way.î†LISTEN:Guilfoyle noted Rep. Jerry Nadlerís (D-NY) call for an ìproper investigationî of ìcredible accusationsî against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, should Democrats secure a House majority in 2018ís midterm elections. He described Kavanaugh as ìcredibly accusedî of sexual assault.ìThis is going to be total lawlessness and anarchy,î added Guilfoyle. ìAnd thatís what the Democrats want. I canít stress enough Ö this is not your grandfatherís Democrat Party. This is a radicalized power-hungry party that will stoop to any low and level to destroy anybody who tries to align with this president.îGuilfoyle described the Senateís confirmation of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court as evidence that Republicans must ìfight backî against their political opponents.ìItís a great day for America,î said Guilfoyle. ìDonald Trump showed us that it is okay to fight back. In fact, he gave a master class in it, and I couldnít be happier for the country and for Brett Kavanaugh and for his family.îGuilfoyle continued, ìDemocrats went to new and really reprehensible lows in terms of this witch hunt against a fine man who has now had seven FBI background investigations. He is a premier justice. He served this country admirably. Heís had an impeccable life.îGuilfoyle went on, ìI cannot believe it was as if the execution came before any shred or scintilla of evidence in this case against Justice Kavanaugh. He held the line with the backing of our president, and was really courageous and fearless and did the right thing. Guilfoyle said Republicans successfully fought back against ìsmear tacticsî from Democrats. ìI just love the fact that the Republican Party was finally able to fight back,î exclaimed Guilfoyle. ìEnough of taking a knee to the Democrats, because if we gave in on this one, then there isnít really anything to stop them from going forward.îGuilfoyle described forthcoming midterms as a national referendum on President Donald Trumpís administration.Guilfoyle remarked, ìWith midterm elections looming in November, it is imperative that people get out there and vote. Donald J. Trump, our fantastic president, is actually on the ballot in every way, shape, and form.ì[Democrats] want to unseat a duly elected president,î warned Guilfoyle. ìThey want to reverse all the accomplishments. They want to put crying Chuck Schumer in the Senate and Nancy Pelosi to head the House.î

The GOP candidate joined political editor Matt Boyle to discuss her campaign and the importance of Republicans keeping the House.ìMy opponentóa first-term incumbentóhas gone along with the liberal agenda. He voted against the tax cut, he would most assuredly vote for impeachment of our president. He tries to cast himself as moderate, but heís anything but.î said Arizonaís District 1 candidate.ìHe actuallyóI donít even know how you do thisóhe started off as a Republican, then became an Independent, and now heís a Democrat,î laughed Rogers, ìHeís all over the map, trying to be all things to all people.îThe congressional hopeful said the election ìcomes down to†whether or not we want to promote the good news and the prosperity started under the Trump administration, or regress back to the way things wereî and that she had met families on the campaign trail every week who had ìescaped Californiaî in search of better opportunities.Rogers is also the 5th-generation in her family to have a career in the military.ìI started out as a clinical social worker in the Air Force and then went to pilot training in Arizona. My husband was an engineer in the Air Force, so I was the flyer, he was the engineer, and we lived probably half of our 20-year careers overseas. We have two children, we had them both when we were in the military, and now we have grandchildren. This is really a calling, and when one takes the oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, this is a life-long commitment, and so I feel called to serve again.î Rogers continued.ìVoters want their country back,î Rogers affirmed. ìI am so glad that this Kavanaugh confirmation is going to come through, and that Susan Collins did the right thing, and Lindsey GrahamñI had never been a particular fan of either one of them, but, you know, theyíve come through with the right and proper statements to bring due process and the Rule of Law back.îOn the topic of the midterm elections, Rogers said that maintaining a GOP majority in the House is crucial.ìOur entire nation is hanging by the slender thread that runs through the House of Representatives, is the way I look at it, and the way all of my voters look at it.î Rogers stated, ìóthe feeling in my district is that we are at a pivot point, that the future of the country rests on whether or not our president is going to remain president. I tell people, we have the Supreme Court, we have the Senate, we have the presidency, but if we donít hold the House, we are in for a justóa complete devolution and degradation of due process because of exactly what was on display this past week.îYou can follow Wendy Rogersí campaign on her†website.Breitbart News Saturday†is broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 10:00 a.m. ñ 1:00 p.m. Eastern.Follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.

Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). Senators invoked cloture by a vote of of 51-49, thanks to the ìnuclear optionî first engineered by Democrats under former Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) in 2013, lowering the threshold from 60 to 51 for presidential nominations.Before the final vote†was cast, speakers at the protest railed against Kavanaugh, calling him a sexual predator and claiming that the seven FBI background checks and 30-plus hours of testimony from the federal judge were not adequate.††And the protesters, some crying when the news of Kavanaughís confirmation was announced, vowed to continue their battle against him. Clench- fisted demonstrators chanted that they would vote out lawmakers who supported him in Novemberís midterm elections.ìFuck civility,î one sign said. ìThis woman is no pussy and she votes,î another sign said.††ìAll these angry men,î another sign said, which included a photo of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who rallied to Kavanaughís defense after Christine Blasey Ford accused him in the 11th hour of the confirmation process of sexually assaulting her decades ago at a high school party.Kavanaugh categorically denied the allegations and a supplemental FBI investigation into her charges found no corroborating witnesses.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/kavanaugh-sworn-in-justice/,"Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice Saturday night after the Senate confirmed the judge 50-48. The Senate vote delivered an election season triumph to President Donald Trump that could swing the court rightward for a generation.Kavanaugh was quickly sworn in at the court building, across the street from the Capitol, while protesters chanted outside.The quick swearing in enables Kavanaugh to begin work immediately in advance of arguments at the court Tuesday in two cases involving prison sentences for repeat offenders.Kavanaugh's wife and two daughters were next to him as he was sworn in.

Those allegations magnified the clash from a routine Supreme Court struggle over judicial ideology into an angrier, more complex jumble of questions about victimsí rights, the presumption of innocence, and personal attacks on nominees.Acrimonious to the end, the battle featured a climactic roll call that was interrupted several times by protesters in the Senate galleries before Capitol Police removed them.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/anti-kavanaugh-activists-fail-to-disrupt-final-vote/,"Protesters in the Senate gallery Saturday repeatedly attempted to illegally interrupt proceedings as senators voted to make Brett Kavanaugh the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.The shrieking, anguished shouts of leftists began to fill the chamber in rounds ñ as it has so often since the very first hearing on Justice-designate Kavanaughís nomination ñ from the moment Vice President Mike Pence attempted to the call the vote. Pence, keeping an unaffected demeanor, repeatedly called on the Senate sergeant-at-arms to restore order.The activists continued to shout throughout the vote and even after Pence announced Justice-designate Kavanaughís confirmation.ìAs a reminder to our visitors in the gallery, expressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate gallery,î Pence said calmly mid-vote.The screaming was mostly incoherent in the television broadcast, but some shouts managed to come through the microphones. For example, when red state Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) stood to cast his vote, a woman could be heard to shout ìshame!î repeatedly while another called Manchin a ìcoward.îThe activists efforts had no effect on the vote. Kavanaugh was confirmed as the 114th justice of the Supreme Court by a vote of 50-48.It is generally illegal to disrupt Congressional proceedings. Protesters who do so are typically arrested for disorderly conduct or similar charges. U.S. Capitol Police continually removed the groups of shouting protesters at Kavanaughís final vote as they rose, but arrest and charge information was not immediately available.The Womenís March, a left-wing organization founded to oppose President Donald Trump and led in many actions by Linda Sarsour, quickly claimed responsibility for the interruptions, making clear it was their intention to disrupt a congressional vote and prevent Kavanaughís confirmation:Our members are disrupting the Senate from the gallery right now. #CancelKavanaughó Women's March (@womensmarch) October 6, 2018We took the Capitol.We sat the streets outside SCOTUS. We disrupted the Senate proceedings. We want to be able to tell the next generation we did everything we could. #CancelKanavaughó Women's March (@womensmarch) October 6, 2018Some journalists and left-wing commentators quickly expressed their sympathy with the disruptors:The entire last two weeks have felt like one long primal scream https://t.co/JmZM0YpQEVó Kasie Hunt (@kasie) October 6, 2018They literally forced white men in power to plow forward with a nomination of a serial sexual abuser over their screams of no. These women are heroes. https://t.co/e8PWAlBw2Yó Lauren Rankin (@laurenarankin) October 6, 2018In his statement before the vote, in which he opposed Kavanaughís confirmation, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) reiterated his support for the protesters, calling their disruption ìfree speech.îKavanaughís nomination, likely the most contentious in American history, was beset by protesters inside hearing rooms from the very start, including weeks before Christine Blasey Fordís uncorroborated, 36-year-old accusation of sexual assault threw Kavanaughís nomination fight into unprecedented chaos. Dozens of leftist activists were arrested even before Kavanaugh gave his very first opening statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee.Then too, Durbin repeatedly expressed support for these illegal protesters, calling it ìthe noise of democracy.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/donald-trump-alaska-will-never-forgive-lisa-murkowski-for-opposing-brett-kavanaugh/,"President Donald Trump warned Sen. Lisa Murkowski that she might face political retribution for her decision to oppose his nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh.ìI think she will never recover from this,î Trump said. ìI think the people from Alaska will never forgive her for what she did.îThe president commented about the process in an interview with the Washington Post that was published on Saturday.Murkowski voted against cloture for Kavanaughís confirmation on Friday. (On Saturday, Murkowski voted ìnoî on confirmation and later withdrew her vote to be marked ìpresentî so that her Republican colleague in the Senate could attend his daughterís wedding.)The Senate†confirmed Kavanaugh on Saturday afternoon with a final vote of 50-48.Trump noted that he won Alaska easily over his failed challenger, Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, which might make it hard for Murkowski to remain in the Senate. He also reminded readers that he helped Alaska immensely by opening up drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.The president had nothing but praise for Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who faced heavy pressure to vote against Kavanaugh but delivered a widely-praised speech in the Senate to explain why she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh.ìI think what Susan Collins did for herself was incredibly positive,î Trump said in the interview. ìIt showed her to be an honorable, incredible woman. I think sheís got a level of respect thatís unbelievable. I really mean it.î

Ö People that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so importantñalso, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton.îTrump made clear that his Supreme Court picks will ìrespect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, and what it represents.îTrump has fulfilled these promises by giving us Justice Neil Gorsuch, confirmed April 7, 2017, and Brett Kavanaugh, confirmed October 6, 2018.Both Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are guided by the seminal decision in District of Columbia v Heller (2008).During confirmation hearings, Gorsuch referenced Heller in describing the approach to ruling on the constitutional protections of specific types of guns, saying:Heller makes clear that we judges are to apply. The question is whether itís a gun in common use, for self-defenseñand that may be subject to reasonable regulation. Thatís the test as I understand it. Thereís lots of ongoing litigation about which weapons qualify under those standards. And I canít pre-judge that litigation sitting here.Kavanaugh also†referenced Hellerís ìcommon useî phraseology during this confirmation, explaining that AR-15s and similar semiautomatic rifles are in ìcommon useî because widely possessed. Kavanaugh differentiated between ìdangerous and unusual weaponsî versus weapons widely possessed for hunting and self-defense, saying, ìSemiautomatic rifles are widely possessed in the United States. There are millions and millions and millions of semiautomatic rifles that are possessed, so that seemed to fit common use and not be a dangerous and unusual weapon.îThe NRA responded to Kavanaughís conformation by tweeting: ìThe NRA congratulates Brett Kavanaugh on his confirmation to SCOTUS. Kavanaugh is an eminently qualified jurist who will interpret the Constitution as the framers intended. He respects our Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.îAWR†Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host†of the Breitbart podcast†Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of†Down Range with AWR Hawkins,†a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/lawyer-ford-wont-seek-more-investigations-into-kavanaugh/,"Debra Katz, attorney for Christine Blasey Ford, revealed Friday that her client will not urge lawmakers to further investigate allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.In a sit-down interview with CNN chief political correspondent Dana Bash, Katz said Ford does not want Democrats to pursue allegations against Kavanaugh if they retake Congress in November.†ìProfessor Ford has not asked for anything of the sort. What she did was to come forward and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and agree to cooperate with any investigation by the FBI, and thatís what she sought to do here,î said Katz.Asked if Ford would like Democrats to consider bringing impeachment hearings against Kavanaugh, Katz responded†with a simple ìno.îLisa Banks, another lawyer for Ford, told Bash that the 51-year-old California psychology professor is at peace with her decision to go public with her decades-old allegation against the judge.†ìI donít think she has any regrets. I think she feels like she did the right thing,î said Banks.†ìAnd this was what she wanted to do, which was provide this information to the committee so they could make the best decision possible. And I think she still feels that was the right thing to do, so I donít think she has any regrets.îFurther, Banks criticized Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans for pointing out Ford was mistaken when she accused chairman Grassley of failing to accommodate her by traveling to her the West Coast to intimate her. ìWe, as her counsel, informed her of all options made available to us by the committee. We showed her all of the correspondence,î she told Bash ìAnd what they were offering was sending staffers to speak to her. Dr. Ford wanted to speak to the committee members herself. And I think what you saw in the hearing was that Dr. Ford got a little confused and thought Sen. Grassley was suggesting that he himself would have come to California, which is not what he offered at all.îFordís lawyers also said Ford†was saddened by President Donald Trumpís remarks about her during a rally in†Mississippi earlier this week.†ìIt was very hurtful, as it would be to any woman. Any survivor who had the courage to come forward only to be mocked and belittled by anyone really, but certainly by the President of the United States, it was very upsetting. It was very hurtful,î Banks said.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/nolte-winners-and-losers-of-the-kavanaugh-confirmation/,"For a full week after Christine Blasey Fordís allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh became public, I said nothing. While I have a healthy skepticism of politically-timed accusations, there was no way to know.So I kept my mouth shut and looked at the evidence, because that is what Americans are supposed to do. And after a week, it was not only obvious the evidence was lacking, it was just as obvious the evidence all sided with Kavanaugh.Fordís named witnesses all came down on Kavanaughís side (either they did not remember the 1982 house party where the alleged assault attempt took place, or flat-out said it didnít happen). As for Fordís story, it was equal parts devious and leaky. By ìdeviousî I mean a Kafka-esque web no man could ever extricate himself from ó not even with detailed calendars. By ìleakyî I mean full of gaping holes. Not just her convenient memory lapses, but endless contradictions, deceptions, and in the case of her so-called fear of flying, outright lies.Accuser number two, Deborah Ramirez? Her accusation was even weaker. Again, the named witnesses all backed Kavanaugh, and even the far-left New York Times was forced to report she had been calling around admitting she could not remember who flashed her at a dorm party in 1983.Accuser number three, Julie Swetnick? Exactly the kind of hot garbage you would expect from a fame-addicted lawyer made famous by a tabloid outlet like CNN.Like it was for many others, somewhere along the line, everything changed. As the accusations crumbled under the weight of evidence and witness testimony, as Democrats moved the goalposts, as our monstrous media became desperate enough to wave around a high school yearbook like a bloody shirt, this stopped being about politics and the future of the Supreme Court and became about the fate of one man ó an innocent man, a wrongfully accused man, a publicly persecuted man ó which means it suddenly became the most important thing in the world.Watching Brett Kavanaugh stripped naked and publicly humiliated by the organized left and media was excruciating. The obscenity of it, the injustice. Even worse was the tightly-knotted ball of fear growing like a fascist cancer in all decent people, as we lived with the intolerable thought that this abomination might succeed, that the single most appalling act of McCarthyism of my lifetime might actually pay off.I lived through the Clarence Thomas Wars, the Sarah Palin Wars, the public destruction of John McCain and Mitt RomneyÖ This was different. This was murder ó the first-degree, cold-blooded murder of a manís reputation, his young family, and his entire future using the Soviet-style revolutionary tactics of vile lies in pursuit of power.This was a leftist mob backed by the billions of corporate dollars that flow through CNN, NBC, etc., throwing an innocent man, his wife, and traumatized young daughters into a volcano as a sacrifice to the cause, as a means to appease the hysterics stalking the halls of the Senate screaming, ìWitch! WITCH! WIIIIIIITCH!!!!!!!!!îDemocrats and the media were not even interested in convincing us Kavanaugh had done something wrong. Their only goal was to make him so personally toxic, his guilt or innocence no longer mattered. And the only word for that is demonic.I am not one to lose sleep over politics, and I am certainly not one to admit to such a thing, but this was different ó I lost a ton of sleep; I lived with dread, and other than family members, I have never prayed harder for anyone than I did for Judge Kavanaugh: ìPlease, God, do not forsake this man.îHere are the winners and losers of the Dreyfus Kavanaugh AffairÖWINNERS: The Rule of LawAs Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Sean Hannity Friday, we were at the edge of an abyss, an abyss where smears and the dark art of character assassination were about to become legitimized. Yes, I am a bit uneasy that we came so close to going over that abyss, and even more anxious over the fact that not a single Democrat or member of the establishment media had the moral courage to be the Joseph Welch of their time, to point to their own and ask, ìHave you no sense of decency?îBut for now we have a reprieve, and maybe even a little hope that the hangover from this crushing loss might awaken the conscience in just one Democrat or just one adult in the media.Associate Supreme Court Justice Brett KavanaughBrett Kavanaughís unforgettable testimony in defense of his own character and future was like the last 20 minutes of Rocky III.† One man against all the odds, against the indomitable power of the state, the corrupt power of the media, and then he looked both in the eyes and sneered, ìYou ainít so bad.îHis raw testimony was not only a turning point for Kavanaugh when things looked darkest (in the immediate wake of Fordís testimony), it was a catharsis for those of us who had spent a week being force-fed bitter lies and injustice.With the previous Sunday nightís triple sucker punch of Ford, Ronan Farrow, and† Michael Avenatti, the left pushed all their chips into the middle of the table, certain Kavanaugh would fold.He didnít. He called their bluff.ìYou will never get me to quit,î he said Ö and evil gulped.President Donald J. TrumpSimply put, with this, his second Supreme Court Justice, Trump has secured his presidential legacy. The dream of a 5-4 conservative court is as old as I am, and only Trump could have ensured this, because Trump is the only Republican president who would have ever had the courage to not sacrifice Kavanaugh in the hopes of getting someone else approved before the midterm elections.President Trump showed enormous character where no one else would have.Let me repeat that wordÖ Character.Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME)As agonizing as the suspense of the last 72 hours were, Senate Republicans planned it to perfectionÖ.Put all eyes on Susan Collins, put all the media attention on Susan Collins, and then have this moderate, pro-choice, anti-Trump woman use the national spotlight to deliver a devastating closing argument in favor of Kavanaughís confirmation.It was a brilliant political move, and she was brilliant, and serious, and informed, and above allÖ American.That was the most American speech I have ever heard on the Senate floor, a speech based on facts, eternal principles, and basic human decency.The pressure Collins was under to go the other way, the incentives from the media to be a feminist hero, the threats, the emotional blackmail and bullyingÖ God bless her.If Brett Kavanaugh was Rocky III, Susan Collins was Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. Her speech should be taught in every high school in America.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC)Since no Democrat or member of the media would do it, Graham did. These four minutes and twenty-six seconds of moral clarity funneled through righteous rage asked the question as forcefully and as clearly as anyone ever could: ìHave you no decency, sir?î From that point, there was no going back. The truth had been released.From then on, Graham was our happy warrior, our Jiminy Cricket dashing through the halls of Congress, popping up on cable news, and spreading the good news about truth and decency in ways that could no longer be denied.I cannot wait for Graham to become Trumpís next Attorney General.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY)Never flinched. Never wavered.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ)When Flake threw the wrench in the confirmation gears last week with his call for an FBI investigation devoted to the sexual assault allegations, the nasty ìFlake Flakesî headlines flew. Again, I kept my mouth shut. Some part of me believed he had done the right thing. As symbolic as this investigation would be, sometimes symbolism matters.From the sound of it, Collins probably would have voted ìnoî without the FBI report.But look at the countryÖ only 37 percent said they wanted Kavanaugh confirmed, but that number jumps to 60 percent if the FBI investigation comes back cleanÖ as it did.Flake said he believed it was good for the country to wait a week, and he was 100 percent correct. Whatís more, that week was of enormous help to further proving Kavanaughís innocence because all the new information came out in his favor, and there was a lot of it.This left the monstrous media sputtering about virginity and farting, which again seemed to only piss Susan Collins off all the more.Had Kavanaugh won confirmation last week, it would have looked rigged and unjust to a lot of people.Jeff Flake was not only right, he did a courageous thing.Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA)The hero behind the scenes, the man saddled with the paperwork and Avenatti nonsense, and appeasing McCarthy-ite Democrats in the name of Senate decorum.But the FBI backed up the work of his committeeís investigators, and the tireless 84-year-old even found time to compose some of the most satisfying takedowns of the whole sordid affair.The Republican Party To paraphrase a former First Lady, for the first time in my life Iím proud of the Republican Party ó even some Never Trumpers.The Federalist SocietyThey found a man so qualified, only a witch hunt could bring him down.They found a man so decent, the witch hunt failed.Rachel MitchellThe Maricopa County sex prosecutor was widely criticized for her cross-examination of Dr. Ford, but she wasnít there to preen for the cameras or to play Perry Mason. She wanted Ford on record, she asked all the correct and pointed questions, and if you donít think her devastating, fact-based report didnít help to sway Susan Collins, you have not been paying attention.Breitbart News and New MediaThose who wanted facts over hysteria, evidence over innuendo, and truth over emotional blackmail only had one place to turn and that was New Media, specifically online new media.And yeah, Iím going to toot our own horn, because I am also a consumer of news, and as a voracious consumer of Kavanaugh news, it was Breitbart where I always clicked first. Our team did an extraordinary job, not just of documenting the circus and the politics, but in examining the evidence and cutting through the media bullshit.Yay, us.†LOSERS: The Organized LeftWhen you read about things like the Salem Witch Trials, McCarthyism, and blacklists, you assume we are too well educated, mature, and ashamed of this history to ever repeat it. Well, repeat it we did, and now, after pouring all their hopes, dreams, schemes, hate, rage, integrity, endless hours of work, and piles of money into this cause, these godless fuckers lostÖ and like the vampires they are, the sunlight of decency has them hissing and howling and writhing in a state of complete shock because their own arrogance and provincialism assured them it could never happen.Oh, and theyíre stupid too, just plain dumb. Anyone with a room temperature IQ understood from the beginning, way back in July, just how important Susan Collins was going to be in this confirmation effort. And what did these idiots do? To prove they were bought and paid for, to prove they had no principles whatsoever, they showed up at their first protest with ìStop Kethledgeî and ìStop Hardimanî signs. Collins immediately saw through them and, other than contempt, never gave them another thought.Eager to double down on their indecency, eager to prove they are anti-science conspiracy theorists immune to facts and evidence, still they protest and rage against the ìserial rapistî like a horde of crybabies who have nothing left but to wish that everyone else gets hit by a train. And by doing so, they are forcing Democrats to promise they will impeach Kavanaugh if they win in the midterms ó which will only ensure this issue doesnít lose its potency with Republican voters.Rage on, you simple-minded swarm of spoiled sheep, your tactics not only no longer work ó †they backfired spectacularly.DemocratsBecause nothing they held most dear ó open borders, gay marriage, abortion, etc. ó was able to win at the ballot box, they abused the courts to force their agenda down our throats.The days of transforming our country through judicial activism are over, and that is a catastrophe for the left.The Establishment MediaThis loss is as devastating to the CNNs, NBCs, NPRs, and Washington Posts as Trumpís presidential victory.Every single one of these liars (who have harbored dozens of their own #MeToo perps for decades) went all-in to destroy an innocent man, and now they have lost the remaining ticketholders of their kabuki theater of objectivityÖ At long last, even Never Trump sees them for the monsters they truly are. †And yes, they are the enemy of the people. Well, decent people.Whatís more, for at least ten days, all of the power of the media ó print, online, and broadcast ó was targeted at only a handful of senators. Naked, shameless, 24/7 propaganda and appeals to emotion directed at a half dozen people, and still they belly-flopped ó primarily because alternative media was just as tireless in putting out the facts.The establishment media vastly out-funds and out-mans alternative media, but we can still kick their candy asses because truth and decency are on our side.Michael AvenattiEven the far-left Washington Post had to concede that Avenatti parachuting into this debate with a fistful of lies about Kavanaugh being a serial rapist backfired big time.Anyone looking for proof the organized left had constructed a campaign of character assassination against an innocent man could not only look at what Avenatti was up to, but how seriously his confederates in the media took his outrageous claims.CNN built Avenatti, so donít forget to thank Jeff Zucker.Lisa MurkowskiThe only Republican Senator to vote against Kavanaugh made up her mind while walking in to vote on cloture, and her only explanation was, ìHeís not the right man for the court.îYou can do better, Alaska.Fox NewsThe opinion line-up was fine, it was the news part of Fox News that disgraced itself with a litany of fake news about Dr. Ford being ìcredible.îIt is not about the politics or the even the fate of the Supreme Court ó the fate of a man was on the line, a whole man, and Fox News, of all places, threw him to the wolves by declaring ó without a shred of evidence, without hearing his side ó that the sexual assault allegations against him ìcredible.îThat is as un-American as it gets.Fox News is dead to me.Never Trump Dead-EndersDavid Frum, Jennifer Rubin, Joe Scarborough, Bill KristolÖ These are not conservatives outraged over Trumpís this or that, these are hysterics and principle-free egomaniacs.Cory BookerThe only thing we learned about Spartacus throughout all of this is that he is no Obama. Say what you want about our former president, he was unflappable, intelligent, composed, and nearly impossible to catch off guard.Booker is a quarter-witted deer in the headlights, and watching Trump eat his lunch in 2020 is going to be GLORIOUS.#MeTooNow that decent people know that the left and media are willing to exploit and pervert what had been a just cause into an obscenity against people who are guilty only of holding ìincorrectî beliefs, #MeToo will never be what it was, not even close, and that is a shame.The MatriarchyI am not arguing The Patriarchy is perfect, but we have just spent 18 days living inside The Matriarchy only to discover it is a circle of hell built on a foundation of nightmares ó of shrill injustice led by mindless mobs cheered on by brown-nosers like Jake Tapper who conceal their bullying behind ìvirtueî as they proclaim weíve ìheard enough from men.îOverall, I cannot think of a worse three weeks for those who wish to put an end to the stereotype about women being spiteful, driven by emotion, and lacking in reason.HollywoodThe industry with a whole lot more #MeToo perps than stars is now so universally despised, their thoughtless rants and snobbish peacocking actually do more to help Trumpís cause than any super PAC ever could. We now welcome their unhinged ravings, their mean-spiritedness, their willingness to spoil every good time by strutting in with a soapbox.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/06/kavanaugh-confirmed-possibly-most-conservative-supreme-court-since-1934/,"WASHINGTON, DC ñ Brett Kavanaugh became the 114th justice to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court on Saturday, when the Senate confirmed him by a vote of 50-48, handing President Trump and Republicans a historic victory that shifts the balance of power on the Court.The vote came in the middle of the afternoon on Saturday, less than 30 hours after the Senate invoked cloture late Friday morning to end an attempted filibuster by Senate Democrats and one Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). Senators invoked cloture by a vote of of 51-49, thanks to the ìnuclear optionî first engineered by Democrats under former Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) in 2013, lowering the threshold from 60 to 51 for presidential nominations.Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) was in his home state during the final vote, walking his daughter down the aisle at her wedding. Daines was willing to take a private jet immediately back to Washington if necessary to cast the deciding vote, but Murkowski ñ the only Republican to oppose Kavanaugh ñ agreed to vote ìPresentî instead of ìNoî on the final vote, to neutralize the effect of Dainesí absence and keep the two-vote margin for Kavanaughís confirmation.Watch the Senate Vote:President Trump sees appointing conservative Supreme Court justices as one of the reasons he was elected. Polling showed that in the 2016 election, 48 percent of voters said the Supreme Court was a major factor in their presidential vote, and 21 percent of voters said it was their top issue. Those voters chose Trump over Hillary Clinton by a margin of 57 to 41.Saturdayís confirmation marks more than the dramatic conclusion to a political battle that has waged for more than three months, and instead could mark an inflection point in a philosophical war that has raged for decades.The Supreme Court has not had a conservative majority since 1934, when the New Deal took hold and the Court moved to the left, giving the federal government vast new powers over economic issues. The Court massively broadened federal powers over commerce, taxing, and federal spending.The Court abandoned the original meaning of several key constitutional provisions during the 1930s: in 1934, the Contracts Clause (Blaisdell); in 1935, the Appointments Clause (Humphreyís Executor); in 1936, the Spending Clause (Butler); and in 1937, the Commerce Clause (Jones & Laughlin Steel). These radically expanded the role of the federal government in peopleís lives.A conservative majority on the Court has been considered within striking distance since 1993, when two moderate justices were the swing votes on almost every issue that divided along philosophical lines. In 2006, conservative Justice Samuel Alito replaced one of those moderates, Justice Sandra Day OíConnor.Since then, the Supreme Court has long been divided with four conservative justices to one degree or another, and four liberal justices on the other. The crucial fifth vote was the sole remaining moderate, Justice Anthony Kennedy.When Kennedy announced on June 27 that he would retire during the summer, both political parties ñ and especially their respective bases ñ leapt into action with the most expensive, most brutal Supreme Court confirmation in American history. Both sides understood that issues of overwhelming importance both to conservatives and to liberals could be at stake.Talking heads quickly zoned in on Trumpís ìListî of 25 potential justices. A week later, President Trump had narrowed it to four finalists: Judges Thomas Hardiman, Amy Barrett, Raymond Kethledge, and Brett Kavanaugh.On July 9, President Trump announced during a primetime address from the East Room of the White House that he was nominating Judge Kavanaugh, who has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 2006.The political Left went into immediate meltdown, with raucous protests outside the U.S. Supreme Court. Alternate protest posters left on the ground included the names of the other three finalists as well, showing that liberals would have had a fit for any nominee President Trump might choose.Experts from both sides dived deeply into Kavanaughís lengthy paper trail. He has authored an impressive 307 published opinions during his 12 years on the bench, totaling over 6,000 pages of judicial writing. When combined with the opinions he joined written by his colleagues, senators had over 11,000 pages of judicial decisions to examine in assessing Kavanaughís fitness for the High Court.Beyond that, Kavanaugh submitted over 112 pages of answers to questions from senators, and included 17,000 pages of attachments. When combined with the records released from his public service over the past quarter-century, senators were flooded with a staggering 483,000 pages of material to review on Kavanaugh ñ more than the past five Supreme Court nominees combined ñ setting an all-time record.Kavanaughís hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the first week of September were heavy-hitting and constantly interrupted by protests, but he weathered the storm and appeared to be on a glide path to confirmation.All that changed during the second half of September, when accusers brought forth sordid and salacious accusations of a sexual nature, which had never come up during Kavanaughís long service or the six FBI background investigations throughout his career.A final curveball came in the form of Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who said he would require a final FBI background check into these allegations before voting for the judge on the Senate floor. Sens. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) acquiesced, in light of their razor-thin margin in the Senate.The FBI came back saying that they found no corroboration for the accusations. Flake and several other moderate senators then announced their support for Kavanaugh, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) who gave an impassioned speech about the presumption of innocence and due process.Collinsí speech highlighted how toxic judicial confirmation fights have been over the past couple years, deepening the divides in the nation. Experts worry that many of the most qualified candidates for high office ñ and especially the Supreme Court ñ will not answer the call to serve since it means lasting trauma for their families and reputations.Regardless of all that, at age 53 Justice Kavanaugh now takes his seat as the newest associate justice on the Supreme Court, and is expected to serve for decades. Major cases already pending before the Court could reveal very quickly whether he is what conservatives have been waiting for these many years.Justice Kavanaugh will begin hearing cases on Tuesday, October 9.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Susan Collins (R-ME) faced a torrent of death threats and abuse on Twitter following her declaration that she would vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and her remarks in defense of the presumption of innocence. So far, Twitter has taken no action, allowing the threats against a sitting Senator to remain on the platform.Multiple Twitter users said they wished to ìpunchî Sen. Collins.https://twitter.com/millerjr99/status/872836744563101697https://twitter.com/kitkatesq/status/1048291419985727489I am also.

Bitch.ó Donna Rogers (@DonnagoodRogers) October 6, 2018Twitter has been slow to respond to death threats against Republicans in the past, at times taking weeks to remove the threatening content. The platformís double standards can also be seen in the way it handles complaints of abuse against conservatives and individuals linked to conservatives. When the daughters of Islam critic Pamela Geller were bombarded with abuse earlier this year,†Twitter did nothing.†In fact, some of the abusive tweets remain on the site, undeleted.Other notorious examples of Twitter failing to take action against progressives who break the platformís rules include the case of Peter Fonda, who was allowed to remain verified on the platform despite calling for 12-year old Barron Trump to be ìlocked in a cage with pedophiles.î†New York Times†journalist Sarah Jeong was also granted verified status on the platform, a distinction that gives her tweets greater visibility, despite breaking the platformís hate speech rules by comparing white males to ìdogs pissing on fire hydrants.î By Twitterís own admission, verification is a tacit mark of endorsement from the platform.Meanwhile, Twitter takes the slightest excuse to ban high-profile conservatives who are crucial to mobilizing grassroots Trump supporters and Republicans ahead of the midterms. At times, Twitter has banned conservative figures simply for posting facts that some find offensive. The high-profile right-wingers and critics of progressivism banned from the platform include Tommy Robinson, Chuck Johnson, Hunter Avellone, Roger Stone, and Carl Benjamin. Similar permabans of high-influence progressives are virtually unheard of.Breitbart News has reached out to Twitter for comment.Allum Bokhari is the senior technology correspondent at Breitbart News.

Kavanaugh if they win control of the House in November, Representative Jerrold Nadler, the New York Democrat in line to be the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said on Friday.Speaking on the eve of Judge Kavanaughís confirmation vote this weekend, Mr. Nadler said that there was evidence that Senate Republicans and the F.B.I. had overseen a ìwhitewashî investigation of the allegations and that the legitimacy of the Supreme Court was at stake. He sidestepped the issue of impeachment.ìIt is not something we are eager to do,î Mr. Nadler said in an interview. ìBut the Senate having failed to do its proper constitutionally mandated job of advise and consent, we are going to have to do something to provide a check and balance, to protect the rule of law and to protect the legitimacy of one of our most important institutions.îRead the rest of the story at the New York Times.

Susan Collins (R-ME) was alienated.ìThe left has given up on making its own case,î Carlson said. ìActivist no longer try to convince anyone of anything. Instead, they scream and bully. As a tactic, this can be effective. It worked many years for the Mafia, for example. But there is a cost to it, especially when it is on television. Normal people find it scary and unreasonable because that is exactly what it is: scary and unreasonable. The left is going too far, and it is alienating even liberal Republicans like Susan Collins.îHe went on say the protests brought to light how the left ìreally thinks.îìIf thereís one thing we learned during the last month, itís what the activist left really thinks,î he added. ìAnd a lot of people are scared by what they really think. Though actually, the term ëthinkí may be too generous. A lot of what weíre hearing isnít the product of thinking at all.

Wade. He also suggested that some restaurant and hotel owners would refuse to serve gay customers and said the Supreme Court will now side with the restaurant and hotel owners.ìWait until they start getting cases from hotel owners who say I donít want to use my creativity for gay customers, and restaurant owners who donít want to serve gay customers,î Toobin warned. ìI mean this is a dramatic change coming, and the conservatives are in charge.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/local/2018/10/05/2020-kamala-harris-heading-to-iowa-after-blasting-unfit-kavanaugh/,"Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) is reportedly planning to head to Iowa at the end of the October and will spend time in the first-in-the-nation caucus state during the final weekend before the 2018 midterm elections.According to a report in The Atlantic, the 2020 presidential contender ìhas been reaching out to Democrats in Iowaî about the planned trip.By planning to visit Iowa just weeks before the 2020 election cycle kicks off, Harris, according to the outlet, is crossing ìa symbolic but unmistakably significant line toward owning her interest in a presidential campaign.îSpeaking on the Senate floor on Friday afternoon about President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Harris blasted Kavanaughís Thursday evening Wall Street Journal†op-ed in which Kavanaugh tried to assure lawmakers about his independence and temperament.Harris said that Kavanaugh had told the Judiciary Committee that he had written his ìpartisanî speech and his testimony was not some spontaneous outburst.ìHeís a partisan,î Harris said. ìLetís believe him at his word.îHarris said Kavanaugh has not proven that he can demonstrate ìimpartiality, integrity, and truthfulnessî and said the FBI investigation was not a ìsearch for the truthî but ìabout politics and raw power to push through an unfit nominee.îHarris added that she was ìdeeply disturbed that the Senate is moving forwardî with Kavanaughís nomination and called the process a ìtravestyî that did not do Christine Blasey Ford or the American people justice.ìEvery American is entitled to the benefit of the doubt,î Harris said in concluding her remarks. ìBut nobody is entitled to a seat on the United States Supreme Court.îDuring the Kavanaughís confirmation hearings, Harris was the first Democrat on the Judiciary Committee to interrupt Chairman Chuck Grasssley (R-IA) during his opening statement on the first day of the hearing. Democrats spent most of that morning interrupting Grassley and trying to turn the hearing into a circus.She aggressively questioned Kavanaugh, accusing him of using ìdog-whistlesî with words like ìabortion on-demandî and ìracial spoils system.îHarris fundraised off of the hearings as left-wing activists praised her for asking Kavanaugh about whether he believed men could be friends with some women while mistreating others.†She also questioned Kavanaugh about whether he has communicated with anyone from President Donald Trumpís lawyerís law firm, even warning Kavanaugh to be careful about his response.But even her home-state papers had to concede that Harrisís grandstanding on the issue ìfailed miserablyî and ended in the ìmost anticlimactic way.îHarris was also condemned for posting a ìsliced-and-dicedî video of Kavanaughís testimony that made it appear like Kavanaugh was saying that he believed contraceptives are ìabortion-inducing drugs.îThough Harrisís official answer when asked about her 2020 ambitions has been that she is ìnot ruling outî a presidential, left-wing activists have been urging her to take on Trump after praising her grilling of Kavanaugh.†In recent months, some overseas bookmakers have made Harris the favorite to win her partyís nomination in 2020.

Susan Collins (R-ME) for her criticism ó not by name ó of him and of his client, Julie Swetnick, for claiming Kavanaugh participated†in gang rapes. ì.@SenatorCollins should be ashamed of herself for attacking my client and Dr. Ford,î Avenatti wrote on Twitter. ìHow did she make a credibility determination as to my client? How is she qualified to do that without ANY investigation? She did ZERO to determine whether my client and her witnesses were credible.îDuring an impassioned†Senate floor speech, Collins blasted Swetnickís ìoutlandish allegationî and said its propagation by activists seeking to stop Kavanaughís confirmation is a ìstark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness.î Minutes after she confirmed her intention to vote ìyesî for Kavanaughís confirmation, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) stepped up as the first Democrat to support Kavanaugh.Feldscher responded to the outburst by blaming Avenattiís antics for the presumed success of Kavanaughís confirmation. ìHard to state how much Avenattiís entrance into this process hurt the Democratic effort to bring down Kavanaughís nomination,î Feldscher wrote.Hard to state how much Avenatti's entrance into this process hurt the Democratic effort to bring down Kavanaugh's nomination. https://t.co/tcofogweNoó Kyle Feldscher (@Kyle_Feldscher) October 5, 2018Avenatti fired back, calling his analysis an insult to sexual assault survivors. ìYou are right,î Avenatti wrote sarcastically. ìI should have turned my back on my client.

Days later, the lawyer released a sworn statement written by his client, Julie Swetnick, a longtime Maryland†resident with a questionable past, who claimed Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge spiked punch bowls with drugs at parties during the 1980s in an effort to take advantage of women.Over the last two weeks, Avenatti has pushed for the committee and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to interview Swetnick, a request†both denied due to a lack of credibility of the claims. In a letter to panel members, a man claiming to be Swetnickís one-time boyfriend, Dennis Ketterer, raised doubts about her testimony.Ketterer told senators that Swetnick said she enjoyed engaging in group sex and said her father revealed to him she†ìhad psychological and other problems.î Avenatti told the Washington Post on Friday that he may file a defamation lawsuit against Ketterer for making those statements.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/heidi-heitkamp-ad-touting-bipartisanship-mysteriously-disappears-after-opposition-to-kavanaugh/,"A campaign ad for Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) that touted her bipartisan credentials mysteriously disappeared from Internet the day after the senator announced her opposition to Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.Sen. Heitkamp announced a new ad on Thursday, entitled ìEvery Day,î in which she touted her independence from the political system and how she agrees with both Democrats and Republicans on varying issues.ìToo many Democrats donít appreciate our commitment to faith and self-reliance or recognize that we know how to handle guns safely,î Heitkamp said. ìAnd while Republicans too often side with the powerful, Democrats too often judge how we live. And both parties do nothing but fight.îNBC News reported on Thursday that the ad serves as part of a six-figure ad buy running on cable and broadcast television and on digital platforms as well.The ad came out the same day that the North Dakota Democrat, who claims to be bipartisan, also announced her opposition to President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court nominee Judge Kavanaugh.Heitkamp told a local North Dakota news station, ìThe process has been bad but, at the end of the day, you have to make a decision, and Iíve made that decision. I will be voting no on Judge Kavanaugh.îThe ad enflamed political controversy, as she claimed to be bipartisan on the same day that she said she will oppose the presidentís nominee. The North Dakota Republican Party quickly denounced the campaign ad.There remains one hitch for readers who might want to watch the campaign adñ the ad no longer exists on YouTube, her campiagn YouTube account, her Instagram page, her Facebook page, nor does it exist on Heitkampís campaign website. An NBC News article references the ad and even embeds the article on the page, but the video is no longer ìavailableî on YouTube.The North Dakota Republican Party also confirms the existence of the ad, considering they released a press release attacking the ad on Thursday. It remains unclear if the ad will continue to be played on television given that it no longer exists on the Internet.Sean Higgins, Heitkampís press secretary, tweeted out the NBC news article of the ad in which Heitkamp ìflexes her independence.îHiggins wrote on Thursday, ìHeitkamp in new statewide TV and digital ad: ìWhile Republicans too often side with the powerful, Democrats too often judge how we live.î Heidiís always been a tough, independent voice for North Dakota. Thatíll never change. #ndsen #ndpol.îHeitkamp in new statewide TV and digital ad: ìWhile Republicans too often side with the powerful, Democrats too often judge how we live.îHeidi's always been a tough, independent voice for North Dakota. That'll never change. #ndsen #ndpol https://t.co/yAm6nzNtxjó Sean Higgins (@smhigg) October 5, 2018Sen. Heitkampís campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment on what happened to the campaign ad in question.Jake Wilkins, the North Dakota Republican Party communications director, told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement on Friday that it is no surprise that the Heitkamp campaign will try to remove this ad given that her campaign has tried and failed to rewrite her liberal voting record.ìThis is no surprise,î Wilkins told Breitbart News. ìWith just over a month left until the election, the Heitkamp campaign is desperately scrambling to rewrite her out-of-touch, liberal voting record; but itís not working.îWilkins slammed the Heitkamp ad on Thursday, claiming that she claims to be a bipartisan even though she has lied about her ìliberal record.î Wilkins said in a statement on Thursday, ìHer new ad ëEvery Dayí makes it clear Heidi Heitkamp is going to spend ëEvery Dayí lying about her liberal record. Heitkamp was elected to represent the people of North Dakota in the Senate, but she has failed, and a new TV ad canít erase that.îHeitkampís decision to vote against Kavanaugh serves as a dangerous political risk in a state that Donald Trump won by 35 points in the 2016 presidential election. A Fox News poll found that Cramer has a 12-point lead over Heitkamp. In the last Fox News poll, Cramer only had a four-point lead.The Fox News poll also found that if Heitkamp were to vote against Kavanaugh, 34 percent would be less likely to vote for her, whereas only 17 percent would be likely to vote for her.The Judicial Crisis Network (JCN)†released†a poll Tuesday showing that 56 percent of North Dakotans want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court. A majority of independents, 51 percent, also want the nominee added to the Supreme Court. Fifty percent of women want Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court as well.Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Heitkampís Republican challenger, slammed the North Dakota Democrat on Thursday, saying that she sided with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and the ìextreme leftî over North Dakotans.ìIím deeply disappointed with Senator Heitkampís decision to vote no on Judge Kavanaughís nomination to the Supreme Court,î Rep. Cramer said in a statement on Thursday. ìClearly, she has decided to vote with Chuck Schumer, and not the people of North Dakota,î Cramer added.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/10/05/leftists-confront-sex-assault-survivor-who-supports-kavanaugh/,"Annabelle Rutledge†of the conservative Christian†group Concerned Women for America came to Sen. Susan Collinsís (R-ME) office†Friday to tell her story of sexual assault in the hours before the key Senator announced her decision with regard to Judge Brett Kavanaughís confirmation.Also present in Collinsí office were anti-Kavanaugh protesters there to tell their own stories and urge Collins ó in vain it would later prove ó not to vote against Judge Kavanaugh.ìThis story isnít only for a certain set of people,î Rutledge said to an anti-Kavanaugh activist. ìItís not only for progressives, itís not only for Democrats, itís for every single person.†Iíd like to join my voice and share my story and I am here today obviously in support of Judge Kavanaugh.îìI am a woman.

And thatís that we canít take the pain that we have from each of these experiences and put it on one man.îRutledge rejected the anti-Kavanaugh protestersí notion that voting for Kavanaugh after he had been accused of misconduct was a vote against all victims of sex crime. ìThatís just not true. You canít take the face of the people who have hurt you and put it on oneñ,î Rutledge began, at which point an anti-Kavanaugh woman raised her hand and said, ìIím just gonna stop you right there.îAs Rutledge spoke her peace, supporting Judge Kavanaugh, other protesters interjected, ìheís a criminal,î ìheís disgusting,î and ìheís a liar!îìExcuse me, Iím a woman, but Iím also a sister. Iím a daughter. I am a niece. I am a sister to four brothers. I am an aunt to three nephews. And it is extremely terrifying to me that one day someone could have a woman come and accuse them of somethingñ,î Rutledge began to explain.ìNot just one,î ìitís not just one woman,î ìthey wonít let them investigate,î and ìitís a sham,î the protesters shouted in response.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/sarah-palin-fires-warning-shot-at-lisa-murkowski-i-can-see-2022-from-my-house/,"Former Republican Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin fired a warning shot at Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) after the senator voted against the cloture motion to end debate on Judge Brett Kavanaughís confirmation, hinting she may run to unseat the longtime lawmaker in 2022 or endorse a challenger.ìHey @LisaMurkowski ñ I can see 2022 from my houseÖ,î Palin tweeted.Hey @LisaMurkowski ñ I can see 2022 from my houseÖó Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) October 5, 2018In one of the most stunning upsets in Alaska political history, Palin defeated the senatorís father Frank Murkowski to become the stateís governor in 2006. Frank Murkowski, a former two-term senator who was elected governor of Alaska, served one term before Palin defeated him in the Republican gubernatorial primary.Palin, who had been appointed to Alaskaís powerful oil and gas commission board by Frank Murkowski, won broad public support from Alaskans due to her record as a reformer and whistleblower who called out the corruption in the Murkowski administration for cronyism with the big oil companies, an action which led to the largest ethics fine in Alaska history. Frank Murkowski also faced criticism for nepotism when he appointed his daughter, Lisa Murkowski, to his vacant U.S. Senate seat.In 2010, Palin, then the former Republican vice-presidential candidate, backed Tea Party Senate challenger Joe Miller over Sen. Lisa Murkowski.Prior to voting against advancing Kavanaugh, Murkowski suggested that she will oppose President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court nominee this weekend. ìI believe that Brett Kavanaugh is a good man. It just may be that in my view heís not the right man for the court at this time,î Murkowski told reporters on Capitol Hill. She said she respected her colleaguesí support for Kavanaugh, adding, ìI also think weíre at a place where we need to think about the credibility and integrity of our institutions.îAfter remaining undecided on whether Kavanaughís nomination should move forward, Murkowski rendered her decision Friday in dramatic fashion. As the clerk read the names in alphabetical order, all eyes were on Murkowski. Senators stood up in their chairs and voted, some of them loudly.But when it came to Murkowski, she stood up, paused, and whispered ìno,î her voice barely audible. Then she took her seat, looking down with a stone-faced expression.As the end of the vote neared, Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who sits next to Murkowski, leaned over and put her hand on the arm of Murkowskiís chair. The two huddled in deep conversation.A spokeswoman for Murkowski could not immediately confirm that the senator will oppose Kavanaugh on the final vote expected Saturday, but indicated it appeared that way. Kavanaugh could still win confirmation if Murkowski is the only Republican to oppose him. Murkowski claimed she agonized over her vote, telling reporters she didnít make up her mind until she walked into the Senate chamber. ìThis has truly been the most difficult evaluation of a decision that Iíve ever had to make, and Iíve made some interesting ones in my political career,î she said.Breitbart Newsí Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and the Associated Press contributed to this report.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/michael-avenatti-vows-to-sue-julie-swetnick-ex-bf-for-defamation/,"Television lawyer and 2020 Democrat hopeful Michael Avenatti says he is weighing civil and criminal legal action for his client Julie Setnick leveled against Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, even as it appears the Senate will confirm him Saturday.In a brief interview with The Washington Postës Aaron Blake, Avenatti vowed to file a†defamation lawsuit against Dennis Ketterer ó a self-described former boyfriend of Swetnick who, in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, raised doubts over her allegations. Asked why he chose to publicize Swetnickís claims before the committee could fully vet them, Avenatti scoffed, ìWhy in Godís name would I have gone through the media? The media does not determine the veracity of facts and evidence.îAccording to†Ketterer,†Swetnick said she liked group sex, and he said her father told him she†ìhad psychological and other problems.îKettererís full†letter†states:During a conversation about our sexual preferences, things got derailed when†Julie told me that she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time. In fact sometimes with several at one time.†She wanted to know if that would be ok in our relationship.I asked her if this was just a fantasy of hers.†She responded that she first tried sex with multiple guys while in high school and still liked it from time-to-time.†She brought it up because she wanted to know if I would be interested in that.A.I.D.S. was a huge issue at the time. And I had children. Due to her having a directly stated penchant for group sex, I decided not to see her anymore. It put my head back on straight. That was the last conversation we had.Julie never said anything about being sexually assaulted, raped, gang-raped or having sex against her will. She never mentioned Brett Kavanaugh in any capacity.Responding to the letter, Avenatti called†Kettererís claims nothing more than ìgarbageî and sign of desperation from the Republicans.†ìThe allegations he makes are false and without any basis,î he tweeted. ìWe demand that the FBI interview my client & him, and that anyone found to have submitted false info be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.îIn a sworn statement, Swetnick alleged she attended house parties in Maryland during the 1980s, attended by Kavanaugh and friend Mark Judge. According to†Swetnick, she claims to have become aware of instances†in which Kavanaugh spiked punch bowls and alcohol and quaaludes†for the purpose of targeting inebriated women. Swetnick claims she was gang-raped at a gathering where Kavanaugh and Judge were present.MSNBC aired a 10-minute story Monday about reporter Kate Snowís interview with Julie Swetnick, with an excerpt on NBCís Nightly News. The interview was a continued topic of conversation ó and further reporting ó in the following days. In her story, Snow pointed out differences between what Swetnick told her and the affidavit released earlier by her lawyer, Michael Avenatti. For instance, Swetnick in her previous statement had accused Kavanaugh and his friends of ìspikingî the punch at parties with drugs or grain alcohol so girls would lose their inhibitions. In the interview, Swetnick said she saw Kavanaugh standing near the punch but didnít see him or friend Mark Judge spike it.Swetnick also walked back allegations that Kavanaugh and other boys at the party waited their turn to ìgang rapeî girls who had been drugged. She told Snow she had no specific knowledge that this was happening. She did say that she was ìviolatedî by boys at one party but couldnít say whether Kavanaugh was involved. She said she contacted the Montgomery County, Maryland, police about it; when NBC contacted the police to ask if there were any records, they said it could take up to a month to find them.The morning after the interview, Snow said Swetnick provided the names of four people she said she went to some of these parties with. One of these friends is dead, and one said he does not recall a Julie Swetnick. Two others had not returned NBCís inquiries before the story aired and still had not on Tuesday, the network said.Hours after it aired, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told Fox News Channelís Sean Hannity that NBC was a ìco-conspiratorî in Kavanaughís destruction. He said NBC News would never have done the story if the nominee were a Democrat.ìTheir journalistic integrity has been destroyed over this case,î Graham said.As previously reported, Swetnick has an extensive history of involvement in legal disputes, including a lawsuit in which an ex-employer accused her of falsifying her college and work history on her job application. Legal documents from Maryland, Oregon,†and Florida provide a partial picture of a woman who stepped into the media glare amid the battle over Kavanaughís nomination for the nationís highest court.Further, court records show Swetnick has been involved in at least six legal cases over the past 25 years. Along with the lawsuit filed by a former employer in November 2000, the cases include a personal injury suit she filed in 1994 against the Washington, D.C., regional transit authority.Despite her past legal troubles, Avenatti claimed he ìfully vettedî Swetnick before helping her take her claims against Kavanaugh public.Avenatti released a sworn statement by Swetnick in which she says she witnessed Kavanaugh ìconsistently engage in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women in the early 1980s.î In the statement provided to the committee, Swetnick alleged she had been sexually assaulted at a party attended by members of Kavanaughís social circle, but did not accuse him of assaulting her.Swetnick was the third named Kavanaugh accuser to emerge†when Avenatti released details of her accusations on Twitter on the eve of Christine Blasey Fordís testimony.Kavanaugh denied the claims made by Swetnick and other women, characterizing the allegations as a ìjokeî and a ìfarce.îSwetnick, who is from the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., has claimed she is willing to be interviewed by either Congress or the FBI.Some details of the legal disputes sheís been involved in arenít known, because documents in the cases are incomplete or no longer available. Records in the lawsuit filed in late 2000 by her ex-employer, Oregon-based software company Webtrends, donít indicate why it was dismissed. Avenatti said there was a settlement in the case but no money changed hands.In its civil complaint in a state court in Oregon, the company said Swetnick, a software engineer, was an employee for a few weeks before its human resources department received a report that she had engaged in ìunwelcome sexual innuendo and inappropriate conductî toward two male co-workers at a business lunch.The lawsuit said that Swetnick in turn accused Webtrends of subjecting her to ìphysically and emotionally threatening and hostile conditionsî and that she claimed that sheíd been sexually harassed by four co-workers. The co-workers denied the allegations, the suit said.Company officials later determined, the suit said, that Swetnick had provided false information on her employment application. The suit alleged that she had misrepresented the length of time she worked at a previous employer and falsely claimed that sheíd earned an undergraduate degree in biology and chemistry from Johns Hopkins University.Swetnick was on the other side of a civil case in 1994, as a plaintiff, when she filed a personal injury lawsuit in Maryland against the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. She claimed she lost more than $420,000 in earnings after she hurt her nose in a fall on a train in 1992.Swetnick, who described herself in court records as a model and actor, claimed she had ìnumerous modeling commitmentsî with several companies at the time of the accident but missed out them because of her injuries.To support her claim for lost wages, Swetnick named ìKonam Studiosî as one of the companies promising to employ her. A court filing identified Nam Ko, a representative of ìKunam Studios,î as a possible plaintiffís witness for her case.However, Ko said he was just a friend of Swetnickís and that he had never owned a company with a name spelled either way and had never agreed to pay her money for any work before she injured her nose. He said he first met Swetnick at a bar more than a year after her alleged accident.ìI didnít have any money back then. I (was) broke as can be,î Ko said.Ko said he has a hazy memory of Swetnick asking to use him as a ìcharacter referenceî but doesnít recall hearing about her lawsuit. ìI thought it was for a job application,î he said.The paperwork filed in the suit includes a letter addressed to Swetnickís attorney from Richard Zamora, who is identified as a marketing executive from a San Jose, California-based company called Fiber Sign Inc. In the letter, dated March 1994, Zamora said the company had been prepared to hire Swetnick as a model and spokeswoman and pay her a $60,000 base salary but offered the job to someone else after learning of her accident.Zamora later asked a court in Florida for a restraining order against Swetnick. The remaining court records donít show the reasons he gave for asking for the restraining order, but indicate that the case was dropped less than two weeks later when neither party appeared in court.Avenatti said the request for a restraining order was ìnonsense.îCourt records show Swetnickís lawsuit against the transit agency was dismissed in 1997 after a settlement was reached. Vincent Jankoski, one of the lawyers who defended the agency, said the case was resolved without paying Swetnick any money after she failed to provide documentation supporting her lost-wage claims.The Associated Press contributed to this report.†

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/full-text-susan-collins-senate-speech-announcing-yes-vote-for-brett-kavanaugh/,"Read the full remarks that Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) delivered Friday afternoon on the Senate floor to explain her support of Brett Kavanaughís confirmation to the United State Supreme Court.Via Collinsí Senate website:Mr. President, the five previous times that I have come to the floor to explain my vote on the nomination of a justice to the United States Supreme Court, I have begun my floor remarks explaining my decision with a recognition of the solemn nature and the importance of the occasion.But today we have come to the conclusion of a confirmation process that has become so dysfunctional it looks more like a caricature of a gutter-level political campaign than a solemn occasion.The President nominated Brett Kavanaugh on July 9th.† Within moments of that announcement, special interest groups raced to be the first to oppose him, including one organization that didnít even bother to fill in the Judgeís name on its pre-written press release ñ they simply wrote that they opposed ìDonald Trumpís nomination of XX to the Supreme Court of the United States.î A number of Senators joined the race to announce their opposition, but they were beaten to the punch by one of our colleagues who actually announced opposition before the nomineeís identity was even known.Since that time, we have seen special interest groups whip their followers into a frenzy by spreading misrepresentations and outright falsehoods about Judge Kavanaughís judicial record.† Over-the-top rhetoric and distortions of his record and testimony at his first hearing produced short-lived headlines which, although debunked hours later, continue to live on and be spread through social media.† Interest groups have also spent an unprecedented amount of dark money opposing this nomination.Our Supreme Court confirmation process has been in steady decline for more than thirty years.† One can only hope that the Kavanaugh nomination is where the process has finally hit rock bottom.Against this backdrop, it is up to each individual Senator to decide what the Constitutionís ìadvice and consentî duty means.† Informed by Alexander Hamiltonís Federalist 76, I have interpreted this to mean that the President has broad discretion to consider a nomineeís philosophy, whereas my duty as a Senator is to focus on the nomineeís qualifications as long as that nomineeís philosophy is within the mainstream of judicial thought.I have always opposed litmus tests for judicial nominees with respect to their personal views or politics, but I fully expect them to be able to put aside any and all personal preferences in deciding the cases that come before them.† I have never considered the Presidentís identity or party when evaluating Supreme Court nominations.† As a result, I voted in favor of Justices Roberts and Alito, who were nominated by President Bush, Justices Sotomayor and Kagan, who were nominated by President Obama, and Justice Gorsuch, who was nominated by President Trump.So I began my evaluation of Judge Kavanaughís nomination by reviewing his 12-year record on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, including his more than 300 opinions and his many speeches and law review articles.† Nineteen attorneys, including lawyers from the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, briefed me many times each week and assisted me in evaluating the judgeís extensive record.† I met with Judge Kavanaugh for more than two hours in my office.† I listened carefully to the testimony at the Committee hearings.† I spoke with people who knew him personally, such as Condoleezza Rice and many others.† And, I talked with Judge Kavanaugh a second time by phone for another hour to ask him very specific additional questions.I have also met with thousands of my constituents, both advocates and many opponents, regarding Judge Kavanaugh.† One concern that I frequently heard was that Judge Kavanaugh would be likely to eliminate the Affordable Care Actís (ACA) vital protections for people with preexisting conditions.† I disagree with this contention.† In a dissent in†Seven-Sky v. Holder,†Judge Kavanaugh rejected a challenge to the ACA on narrow procedural grounds, preserving the law in full.† Many experts have said his dissent informed Justice Robertsí opinion upholding the ACA at the Supreme Court.Furthermore, Judge Kavanaughís approach toward the doctrine of severability is narrow.† When a part of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds, he has argued for severing the invalid clause as surgically as possible while allowing the overall law to remain intact.This was his approach in his dissent in a case that involved a challenge to the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (PPH v. CFPB).† In his dissent, Judge Kavanaugh argued for ìsevering any problematic portions while leaving the remainder intact.î† Given the current challenges to the ACA, proponents, including myself, of protections for people with pre-existing conditions should want a Justice who would take just this kind of approach.Another assertion I have heard often is that Judge Kavanaugh cannot be trusted if a case involving alleged wrongdoing by the President were to come before the Court.† The basis for this argument seems to be two-fold.† First, Judge Kavanaugh has written that he believes that Congress should enact legislation to protect presidents from criminal prosecution or civil liability while in office.† Mr. President, I believe opponents miss the mark on this issue.† The fact that Judge Kavanaugh offered this legislative proposal suggests that he believes that the President does†not†have such protection currently.Second, there are some who argue that given the current Special Counsel investigation, President Trump should not even be allowed to nominate a justice.† That argument ignores our recent history.† President Clinton, in 1993, nominated Justice Ginsburg after the Whitewater investigation was already underway.† And she was confirmed 96-3.† The next year, just three months after Independent Counsel Robert Fiske was named to lead the Whitewater investigation, President Clinton nominated Justice Breyer.† He was confirmed 87-9.Supreme Court Justices have not hesitated to rule against the presidents who have nominated them.† Perhaps most notably in†United States v. Nixon,†three Nixon appointees who heard the case joined the unanimous opinion against him.Judge Kavanaugh has been unequivocal in his belief that no president is above the law.† He has stated that†Marbury v. Madison, Youngstown Steel v. Sawyer†and†United States v. Nixon†are three of the four greatest Supreme Court cases in history.† What do they have in common?† Each of them is a case where the Court served as a check on presidential power.† And I would note that the fourth case that Judge Kavanaugh has pointed to as the greatest in history was†Brown v Board of Education.One Kavanaugh decision illustrates the† point about the check on presidential power directly.† He wrote the opinion in†Hamdan v. United States,†a case that challenged the Bush Administrationís military commission prosecution of an associate of Osama Bin Laden.† This conviction was very important to the Bush Administration, but Judge Kavanaugh, who had been appointed to the DC Circuit by President Bush and had worked in President Bushís White House, ruled that the conviction was unlawful.† As he explained during the hearing, ìWe donít make decisions based on who people are, or their policy preferences, or the moment.† We base decisions on the lawÖ.îOthers I met with have expressed concerns that Justice Kennedyís retirement threatens the right of same sex couples to marry.† Yet, Judge Kavanaugh described the†Obergefell†decision, which legalized same gender marriages, as an important landmark precedent.† He also cited Justice Kennedyís recent†Masterpiece Cakeshopopinion for the Courtís majority stating that: ìThe days of treating gay and lesbian Americans or gay and lesbian couples as second-class citizens who are inferior in dignity and worth are over in the Supreme Court.îOthers have suggested that the judge holds extreme views on birth control.† In one case, Judge Kavanaugh incurred the disfavor of both sides of the political spectrum for seeking to ensure the availability of contraceptive services for women while minimizing the involvement of employers with religious objections.† Although his critics frequently overlook this point, Judge Kavanaughís dissent rejected arguments that the government did not have a compelling interest in facilitating access to contraception.† In fact, he wrote that the Supreme Court precedent ìstrongly suggestedî that there was a ìcompelling interestî in facilitating access to birth control.There has also been considerable focus on the future of abortion rights based on the concern that Judge Kavanaugh would seek to overturn†Roe v. Wade.††Protecting this right is important to me.To my knowledge, Judge Kavanaugh is the first Supreme Court nominee to express the view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition, but rooted in Article III of our Constitution itself.† He believes that precedent ìis not just a judicial policy Ö it is constitutionally dictated to pay attention and pay heed to rules of precedent.î† In other words, precedent isnít a goal or an aspiration; it is a constitutional tenet that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances.The judge further explained that precedent provides stability, predictability, reliance, and fairness.† There are, of course, rare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court would rightly overturn a precedent.† The most famous example was when the Supreme Court in†Brown v. Board of Education†overruled†Plessy v. Ferguson, correcting a ìgrievously wrongî decisionñto use the judgeís termñallowing racial inequality.† But, someone who believes that the importance of precedent has been rooted in the Constitution would follow long-established precedent except in those rare circumstances where a decision is ìgrievously wrongî or ìdeeply inconsistent with the law.î† Those are Judge Kavanaughís phrases.As Judge Kavanaugh asserted to me, a long-established precedent is not something to be trimmed, narrowed, discarded, or overlooked.† Its roots in the Constitution give the concept of†stare decisis†greater weight such that precedent canít be trimmed or narrowed simply because a judge might want to on a whim.† In short, his views on honoring precedent would preclude attempts to do by stealth that which one has committed not to do overtly.Noting that†Roe v. Wade†was decided 45 years ago, and reaffirmed 19 years later in†Planned Parenthood v. Casey, I asked Judge Kavanaugh whether the passage of time is relevant to following precedent.† He said decisions become part of our legal framework with the passage of time and that honoring precedent is essential to maintaining public confidence.Our discussion then turned to the right of privacy, on which the Supreme Court relied in†Griswold v. Connecticut, a case that struck down a law banning the use and sale of contraceptives.††Griswold†established the legal foundation that led to†Roe†eight years later.† In describing†Griswold†as ìsettled law,î Judge Kavanaugh observed that it was the correct application of two famous cases from the 1920s,†Meyer†and†Pierce, that are not seriously challenged by anyone today.† Finally, in his testimony, he noted repeatedly that†Roe†had been upheld by†Planned Parenthood v. Casey, describing it as ìprecedent on precedent.î† When I asked him would it be sufficient to overturn a long-established precedent if five current justices believed it was wrongly decided, he emphatically said ìno.îOpponents frequently cite then-candidate Donald Trumpís campaign pledge to nominate only judges who would overturn†Roe.† The Republican platform for all presidential campaigns has included this pledge since at least 1980.† During this time, Republican presidents have appointed Justices OíConnor, Souter, and Kennedy to the Supreme Court.† These are the very three justicesóRepublican president appointed justicesówho authored the†Casey†decision,†which reaffirmed†Roe.† Furthermore, pro-choice groups vigorously opposed each of these justicesí nominations.† Incredibly, they even circulated buttons with the slogan ìStop Souter Or Women Will Die!î† Just two years later, Justice Souter coauthored the†Casey†opinion, reaffirming a womanís right to choose.† Suffice it to say, prominent advocacy organizations have been wrong.These same interest groups have speculated that Judge Kavanaugh was selected to do the bidding of conservative ideologues, despite his record of judicial independence.† I asked the judge point blank whether he had made any commitments or pledges to anyone at the White House, to the Federalist Society, or to any outside group on how he would decide cases.† He unequivocally assured me he had not.Judge Kavanaugh has received rave reviews for his 12-year track record as a judge, including for his judicial temperament.† The American Bar Association (ABA) gave him its highest possible rating.† Its Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary conducted an extraordinarily thorough assessment, soliciting input from almost 500 people, including his judicial colleagues.† The ABA concluded that ìhis integrity, judicial temperament, and professional competence met the highest standard.îLisa Blatt, who has argued more cases before the Supreme Court than any other woman in history, testified: ìBy any objective measure, Judge Kavanaugh is clearly qualified to serve on the Supreme Court.î† ìHis opinions are invariably thoughtful and fairÖ.î† Ms. Blatt, who clerked for and is an ardent admirer of Justice Ginsburg, and who is, in her own words, ìan unapologetic defender of a womanís right to choose,î said that Judge Kavanaugh ìfit[s] in the mainstream of legal thought.î† She also observed that ìJudge Kavanaugh is remarkably committed to promoting women in the legal profession.îThat Judge Kavanaugh is more of a centrist than some of his critics maintain is reflected in the fact that he and Chief Judge Merrick Garland voted the same way in 93 percent of the cases that they heard together.† Indeed, Chief Judge Garland joined in more than 96 percent of the majority opinions authored by Judge Kavanaugh, dissenting only once.Despite all this, after weeks of reviewing Judge Kavanaughís record and listening to 32 hours of his testimony, the Senateís advice and consent role was thrown into a tailspin following the allegations of sexual assault by Professor Christine Blasey Ford.† The confirmation process now involves evaluating whether or not Judge Kavanaugh committed sexual assault, and lied about it to the Judiciary Committee.Some argue that because this is a lifetime appointment to our highest court, the public interest requires that doubts be resolved against the nominee.† Others see the public interest as embodied in our long-established tradition of affording to those accused of misconduct a presumption of innocence.† In cases in which the facts are unclear, they would argue that the question should be resolved in favor of the nominee.Mr. President, I understand both viewpoints.† This debate is complicated further by the fact that the Senate confirmation process is not a trial.† But certain fundamental legal principlesóabout due process, the presumption of innocence, and fairnessódo bear on my thinking, and I cannot abandon them.In evaluating any given claim of misconduct, we will be ill served in the long run if we abandon the presumption of innocence and fairness, tempting though it may be.† We must always remember that it is when passions are most inflamed that fairness is most in jeopardy.The presumption of innocence is relevant to the advice and consent function when an accusation departs from a nomineeís otherwise exemplary record.† I worry that departing from this presumption could lead to a lack of public faith in the judiciary and would be hugely damaging to the confirmation process moving forward.Some of the allegations levied against Judge Kavanaugh illustrate why the presumption of innocence is so important.† I am thinking in particular not of the allegations raised by Professor Ford, but of the allegation that, when he was a teenager, Judge Kavanaugh drugged multiple girls and used their weakened state to facilitate gang rape.† This outlandish allegation was put forth without any credible supporting evidence and simply parroted public statements of others.† That such an allegation can find its way into the Supreme Court confirmation process is a stark reminder about why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in our American consciousness.Mr. President, I listened carefully to Christine Blasey Fordís testimony before the Judiciary Committee.† I found her testimony to be sincere, painful, and compelling.† I believe that she is a survivor of a sexual assault and that this trauma has upended her life.† Nevertheless, the four witnesses she named could not corroborate any of the events of that evening gathering where she says the assault occurred; none of the individuals Professor Ford says were at the party has any recollection at all of that night.Judge Kavanaugh forcefully denied the allegations under penalty of perjury.† Mark Judge denied under penalty of felony that he had witnessed an assault.† PJ Smyth, another person allegedly at the party, denied that he was there under penalty of felony.† Professor Fordís life-long friend Leland Keyser indicated that, under penalty of felony, she does not remember that party.† And Ms. Keyser went further.† She indicated that not only does she not remember a night like that, but also that she does not even know Brett Kavanaugh.In addition to the lack of corroborating evidence, we also learned some facts that raised more questions.† For instance, since these allegations have become public, Professor Ford testified that not a single person has contacted her to say, ìI was at the party that night.îFurthermore, the professor testified that although she does not remember how she got home that evening, she knew that, because of the distance, she would have needed a ride ñ yet not a single person has come forward to say that they were the one that drove her home or were in the car with her that night.† And Professor Ford also indicated that even though she left that small gathering of six or so people abruptly and without saying goodbye and distraught, none of them called her the next day ñ or ever ñ to ask why she left ñ is she okay ñ not even her closest friend, Ms. Keyser.Mr. President, the Constitution does not provide guidance as to how we are supposed to evaluate these competing claims.† It leaves that decision up to each Senator.† This is not a criminal trial, and I do not believe that claims such as these need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.† Nevertheless, fairness would dictate that the claims at least should meet a threshold of ìmore likely than notî as our standard.The facts presented do not mean that Professor Ford was not sexually assaulted that night ñ or at some other time ñ but they do lead me to conclude that the allegations fail to meet the ìmore likely than notî standard.† Therefore, I do not believe that these charges can fairly prevent Judge Kavanaugh from serving on the Court.Let me emphasize that my approach to this question should not be misconstrued as suggesting that unwanted sexual contact of any nature is not a serious problem in this country.† To the contrary, if any good at all has come from this ugly confirmation process, it has been to create an awareness that we have underestimated the pervasiveness of this terrible problem.I have been alarmed and disturbed, however, by some who have suggested that unless Judge Kavanaughís nomination is rejected, the Senate is somehow condoning sexual assault.† Nothing could be further from the truth.Every personóman or womanñwho makes a charge of sexual assault deserves to be heard and treated with respect. †The #MeToo movement is real.† It matters.† It is needed.† And it is long overdue. We know that rape and sexual assault are less likely to be reported to the police than other forms of assault.† On average, an estimated 211,000 rapes and sexual assaults go unreported every year. We must listen to survivors, and every day we must seek to stop the criminal behavior that has hurt so many.† We owe this to ourselves, our children, and generations to come.Since the hearing, I have listened to many survivors of sexual assault.† Many were total strangers who told me their heart-wrenching stories for the first time in their lives.† Some were friends I have known for decades, yet with the exception of one woman who had confided in me years ago, I had no idea that they had been the victims of sexual attacks.† I am grateful for their courage and their willingness to come forward, and I hope that in heightening public awareness, they have also lightened the burden that they have been quietly bearing for so many years.† To them, I pledge to do all that I can to ensure that their daughters and granddaughters never share their experiences.Over the past few weeks, I have been emphatic that the Senate has an obligation to investigate and evaluate the serious allegations of sexual assault.† I called for and supported the additional hearing to hear from both Professor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh.† I also pushed for and supported the FBI supplemental background investigation. †This was the right thing to do.Christine Ford never sought the spotlight.† She indicated that she was terrified to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and she has shunned attention since then.† She seemed completely unaware of Chairman Grassleyís offer to allow her to testify confidentially in California.† Watching her, Mr. President, I could not help but feel that some people who wanted to engineer the defeat of this nomination cared little, if at all, for her well-being.Professor Ford testified that a very limited number of people had access to her letter.† Yet that letter found its way into the public domain.† She testified that she never gave permission for that very private letter to be released.† And yet, here we are.† We are in the middle of a fight that she never sought, arguing about claims that she wanted to raise confidentially.One theory I have heard espoused repeatedly is that our colleague, Senator Feinstein, leaked Professor Fordís letter at the eleventh hour to derail this process.† I want to state this very clearly:†I know Senator Diane Feinstein extremely well, and I believe that she would never do that.† I knew that to be the case before she even stated it at the hearing.† She is a person of integrity, and I stand by her.I have also heard some argue that the Chairman of the Committee somehow treated Professor Ford unfairly.† Nothing could be further from the truth.† Chairman Grassley, along with his excellent staff, treated Professor Ford with compassion and respect throughout the entire process.† And that is the way the Senator from Iowa has conducted himself throughout a lifetime dedicated to public service.But the fact remains, Mr. President, that someone leaked this letter against Professor Fordís express wishes.† I suspect, regrettably, that we will never know for certain who did it.† To that leaker, who I hope is listening now, let me say that what you did was unconscionable.† You have taken a survivor who was not only entitled to your respect, but who also trusted you to protect her ñ and you have sacrificed her well-being in a misguided attempt to win whatever political crusade you think you are fighting.† My only hope is that your callous act has turned this process into such a dysfunctional circus that it will cause the Senate ñ and indeed all Americans ñ to reconsider how we evaluate Supreme Court nominees.† If that happens, then the appalling lack of compassion you afforded Professor Ford will at least have some unintended positive consequences.Mr. President, the politically charged atmosphere surrounding this nomination had reached a fever pitch even before these allegations were known, and it has been challenging even then to separate fact from fiction.We live in a time of such great disunity, as the bitter fight over this nomination both in the Senate and among the public clearly demonstrates.† It is not merely a case of different groups having different opinions.† It is a case of people bearing extreme ill will toward those who disagree with them.† In our intense focus on our differences, we have forgotten the common values that bind us together as Americans.† When some of our best minds are seeking to develop ever more sophisticated algorithms designed to link us to websites that only reinforce and cater to our views, we can only expect our differences to intensify.This would have alarmed the drafters of our Constitution, who were acutely aware that different values and interests could prevent Americans from becoming and remaining a single people.† Indeed, of the six objectives they invoked in the preamble to the Constitution, the one that they put first was the formation of ìa more perfect Union.îTheir vision of ìa more perfect Unionî does not exist today, and if anything, we appear to be moving farther away from it.† It is particularly worrisome that the Supreme Court, the institution that most Americans see as the principal guardian of our shared constitutional heritage, is viewed as part of the problem through a political lens.Mr. President, weíve heard a lot of charges and counter charges about Judge Kavanaugh.† But as those who have known him best have attested, he has been an exemplary public servant, judge, teacher, coach, husband, and father.† Despite the turbulent, bitter fight surrounding his nomination, my fervent hope is that Brett Kavanaugh will work to lessen the divisions in the Supreme Court so that we have far fewer 5-4 decisions and so that public confidence in our Judiciary and our highest court is restored.† Mr. President, I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) to attendees as a politician ìwho works for us on the inside.îPromoting Gillibrand, Sarsour stated (video above): ìI want to introduce to you another champion, another one of our people who works for us on the inside. Someone who understands that she works for the people of this country, whoís been speaking up against sexual assault and sexual violence before there was a Brett Kavanaugh. Please give it up for the senator.îThe controversial Sarsour co-hosted the Washington, D.C. rally on Thursday outside the Supreme Court together with another anti-Israel radical and fellow Womenís March organizer, Tamika Mallory.Gillibrandís colleague in the Senate, Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), also spoke at Sarsourís anti-Kavanaugh event. ìI believe Christine Blasey Ford!

Gillibrand authored a profile of Sarsour when the extremist made Time†magazineís 100 most influential people last year.Gillibrand hailed Sarsour and three other leaders of the anti-Trump Womenís March, which Gillibrand also headlined, as ìextraordinary women.îìThese women are the suffragists of our time,î Gillibrand gushed.Gillibrandís office did not respond when major Jewish groups urged the New York senator to retract her praise considering Sarsourís anti-Israel comments, including tweeting that ìNothing is creepier than Zionism.îSarsour also claimed one cannot be a Zionist and a feminist even though Israel is the only country in the Middle East where women have equal rights and the Islamic nations that Sarsour champions are well-known abusers of womenís most basic rights.Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center attempted to appeal to Gillibrandís sensibilities over her support for Sarsour. ìI think the Jewish community in New York and across the U.S. has a lot of respect for the senator, but she may want to reevaluate the statement in Time magazine,î Cooper said. ìIf someone is in effect saying you have to make a choice between being a progressive woman or a Zionist, the senator, reflecting on such comments, would I hope make a different type of statement.îìLinda Sarsour spends most of her waking hours working to delegitimize Israel and its supporters,î Daniel Mariaschin, the Executive Vice President of Bínai Bírith International, commented. ìWeíd ask Senator Gillibrand to recognize that you canít compartmentalize on these things. It isnít enough to say, ëYou know, she worked on the Womenís March, and therefore she deserves this kind of recognition.íîGillibrand also keynoted the October 2017 ìBrooklyn Conferenceî at the Brooklyn Museum, which featured Sarsour as a speaker on the same day.†Another speaker that day was Alicia Garza, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, which supports the BDS movement. The main sponsor of the conference, as advertised in literature for the event, was George Sorosís Open Society Foundations. The Open Society supports scores of pro-BDS groups.Mallory, meanwhile, was in attendance at rabid anti-Semite Louis Farrakhanís Savioursí Day address in March where the Nation of Islam chief used the term ìthat Satanic Jew,î slandered Jews as ìthe mother and father of apartheid,î and spread the anti-Jewish smear that ìwhen you want something in this world, the Jew holds the door.îIn June, Mallory claimed that Israel committed a ìhuman rights crimeî when the Jewish state was established by ìkilling, stealingî and ìtaking the lives of people who were there first.îOne month earlier, Mallory visited Israel with the George Soros-funded Center for Constitutional Rights and met with supporters of the extremist Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement targeting Israel.Aaron Klein is Breitbartís Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/susan-collins-offers-methodical-independent-defense-of-brett-kavanaugh/,"Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) delivered a dramatic, passionate, yet methodical defense of Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the Senate floor on Friday afternoon, as she explained her reasons she would vote to confirm his Supreme Court appointment Saturday.Collins kept her decision a mystery until the last moment. Though she had voted Friday morning for cloture, moving the nomination to a final vote, she had not committed to supporting Kavanaugh, and announced that she would make her choice known in a floor speech at 3:00 p.m. ET. Protesters filled the halls, and occupied her office; they chanted from the gallery as she prepared to speak. Many still held out hope that she would vote no and put the nomination one vote from defeat.Instead, Collins walked through one argument against Kavanaugh after another. She left the personal accusations against Kavanaugh to the end, and prioritized his views on legal precedent and the political independence of the judiciary. She knocked down the claims that he would cancel Obamacareís insurance provisions, or that he would repeal†Roe v. Wade, or that he would favor President Donald Trump in the event that the presidentís own conduct came before the Supreme Court.She then turned to the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford and other accusers, defending the presumption of innocence and laying out the reasons that the charges were not convincing enough to keep Kavanaugh from the highest court ó including the fact that none of Fordís witnesses corroborated her claims. In the only angry portion of her speech, she attacked whoever leaked Fordís original letter to the media, saying that action†ìhas turned this process into such a dysfunctional Senate.îCollins did not mention her recent public spats with the president over his comments about Fordís testimony. She simply focused on the issues, and on the Constitution, concluding: ìMr. President, I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.îJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/susan-collins-vote-yes-brett-kavanaugh/,"Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), the crucial outstanding vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, delivered an extended defense of his record on the Senate floor Friday afternoon as she announced her intention to vote for his confirmation.Collins criticized Democrats and far-left activists for their behavior during the confirmation, saying that the process was reduced to a ìgutterî affair and hit ìrock bottom.îìCertain fundamental principles about due process, the presumption of innocence, and fairness do bear on my thinking and I cannot abandon them,î Collins said while addressing the central matter of the last several weeks: Christine Blasey Fordís allegation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a high school party in 1982.While Collins called Fordís testimony ìsincereî and ìcompelling,î she could not disregard the complete lack of corroboration ó denials of any memory by every witness who Ford claimed was present at the party, plus Kavanaughís own ìforceful denial.îCollins stressed that the confirmation process was not a trial and did not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt to disqualify Kavanaugh. Instead, she only demanded Fordís accusations be ìmore likely than notî true. Collins did not find Fordís allegations against Kavanaugh to meet even this standard.Furthermore, she tore into allegations from Julie Swetnick ó represented by Resistance TV lawyer Michael Avenatti ó that Kavanaugh had drugged and facilitated the gang raping of several women. She called these claims ìoutlandishî and ìa stark reminder of why the presumption of innocence is so ingrained in the American consciousness.îCollins began her eagerly anticipated floor statement began shortly after 3 p.m. to the sounds of shouting and chants from anti-Kavanaugh protesters, like so many of the proceedings over the months-long confirmation process. She launched promptly into an attack on the forces arrayed against Kavanaugh, lamenting their hysterical behavior compared to the five other ìsolemnî Supreme Court confirmations in which she participated.The moderate Maine senator expressed her outrage at organizations that forcefully opposed Kavanaugh before even copy-and-pasting his name into their material and Democrats who announced their intention to end Kavanaughís nomination before hearing a word of testimony.Collins then, in stark contrast to the weeks of controversy over uncorroborated accusations about Kavanaughís behavior as a teenager, dug for over 20 minutes into Kavanaughís 12-year record as a federal judge and his judicial philosophy as gleaned from extensive Senate Judiciary Committee testimony and her own meetings with the nominee.On privacy, healthcare, executive power, and his ability to fairly judge the president who nominated him, Donald Trump, Collins one-by-one addressed Kavanaughís opponentsí concerns. On the centrally important issue of abortion, the pro-choice Collins gave a lengthy refutation of the notion Kavanaugh would overturn Roe v. Wade.She pointed not only to Kavanaughís record and explanations of his philosophy on the Roe precedent but abortion proponentsí long history of exaggerating the threat to Roe from Republican nominees in general, pointing to signs from David Souterís 1990 confirmation process that read ìStop Souter or Women Will Die.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/tech/2018/10/05/facebook-employees-in-uproar-over-executive-who-backs-brett-kavanaugh/,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has come under fire recently due to a top Facebook global policy executiveís decision to support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and appear at his hearing. One prominent executive claims Facebook is an ìapoliticalî company.According to the Wall Street Journal, hundreds of employees at the social media firm Facebook have expressed their anger about top global policy executive, Joel Kaplanís decision to support Brett Kavanaugh at his upcoming hearing. Employees questioned CEO Mark Zuckerberg directly about the Kavanaugh-supporting executive in a weekly question-and-answer session held last Friday, Facebookís COO Sheryl Sandberg ó a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter ó also apparently weighed in on the issue.An internal discussion thread was reportedly filled with hundreds of comments. Many Facebook employees were critical of the executiveís decision to support Kavanaugh. The topic became an issue after a photo of Facebookís Head of Global Policy Joel Kaplan appeared to show the executive present at Kavanaughís hearing last Thursday. This resulted in an internal discussion about how Facebookís executives felt about the #MeToo movement, freedom of speech, and President Trump.Zuckerberg was relatively non-committal in his response to the employeeís issues, stating that he wouldnít have made the same decision as Kaplan, but that his presence at the hearing did not violate any of Facebookís company policies and that Zuckerberg was aware that Kaplan and Kavanaugh had been longtime friends. This, however, did not satisfy employees and the internal debate still continued with Zuckerberg and Sandberg planning to address the employees issues at a town hall meeting on Friday.One employee stated: ìThis fire has been burning for a full week now.î Kaplan reportedly appeared defensive in his initial response, stating that he took the day off, but the executiveís tone shifted as further controversy over his appearance arose. Many were angered over Kaplanís appearance at the hearing as since the 2016 election, Facebook has discouraged employees from expressing their political opinions publicly, but now the companyís head of global policy was appearing at a hearing that had become extremely politicized over recent weeks.Sheryl Sandberg said in an internal post: ìIíve talked to Joel about why I think it was a mistake for him to attend given his role in the company. We support peopleís right to do what they want in their personal time but this was by no means a straightforward case.î Other executives later became involved in the discussion, longtime executive Andrew Bosworth argued at one point that Facebook employees should focus on issues within their control, rather than ones they could not control, such as the Supreme Court nomination process. Other employees made similar arguments that Facebook had other issues to focus on such as their regular security breaches.Bosworth also said that Facebook was an apolitical company and that it may not be a good fit for employees who felt the need to drive political change through their work. Bosworth also linked to mental health resources and helplines for any employees who may need them. This caused an internal uproar and Bosworth deleted his post and made an apology: ìI had hoped it would then help people heal and allow our employees to focus on their work without ongoing anxiety,î he wrote. ìI was wrong and my post was wrong.îAxios reported on the details of the meeting that took place Friday in which Kaplan spoke to coworkers about the controversy. Axios summarized the meeting this way:Facebook sources said Kaplan, Facebookís vice president for global public policy, was solemn and contrite as he said he recognized the difficult situation he had put the company in.Refusing to bow to the attacks, Kaplan explained the tensions between his personal and professional obligations, and said he had a personal obligation to Kavanaugh and his family.Kaplan said he should have talked to Zuckerberg and Sandberg first, according to a Facebook official. Asked whether he had regrets, Kaplan said his core values include friendship and loyalty, and he declined to say if it was a mistake to go.Roberta Thomson, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement: ìSexual assault is an issue society has turned a blind eye to for far too long ó compounding every victimís pain. Our leadership team recognizes that theyíve made mistakes handling the events of the last week and weíre grateful for all the feedback from our employees.îLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/jeff-flake-backs-kavanaugh-murkowski-flip/,"Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) told reporters Friday he would stick with his ìyesî vote for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh at Saturdayís final vote.Flake, one of the small group of Republican senators who refused to conclusively support or oppose Kavanaugh through the weeks of Senate wrangling over allegations of teenage sexual misconduct, voted to end debate on Kavanaughís confirmation Friday morning. Shortly after the vote, Flake indicated he would not flip to a ìnoî vote ìunless something big changesî:SEN FLAKE says he plans to vote yes tomorrow on Kavanaugh unless something big changes and he doesnít see what would change. Says was a hard decision for everybody.ó Alex Moe (@AlexNBCNews) October 5, 2018Flake was joined in his vote for cloture by every other Senate Republican except Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). Along with Sen. Joe Manchinís (D-WV) vote, this was enough to set up a final vote of the full Senate Saturday afternoon. Flake did not address Murkowskiís unexpected break, which she claims she decided only as she walked to the Senate chamber for the vote.Facing an uphill primary battle, Flake is retiring at the end of this term, making his role in the Kavanaugh confirmation likely one of the last significant actions of his Senate career. He shot to the forefront of what is likely the most contentious confirmation fight in American history when, as a Senate Judiciary Committee member, he refused to signal his support for Kavanaugh as allegations against him multiplied. Eventually, Flake voted to recommend Kavanaugh for confirmation but conditioned his final vote on the FBI conducting a seventh background investigation on Kavanaugh.That investigation is complete, and all reports indicate the FBI found no evidence to corroborate any of the allegations Kavanaughís accusers brought.With Murkowski now presumably a ìnoî vote, Flakeís ìyesî is likely a prerequisite for Kavanaughís confirmation. The only remaining plausible swings are Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), who voted ìyesî in Friday morningís cloture vote and will make her final voting intentions known Friday afternoon on the Senate floor, and Manchin, whose vote for cloture may indicate he will support Kavanaugh in the final vote.Complicating matters is that a solid ìyesî vote from Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) is in jeopardy, as he may be unavailable to vote at all due to his daughterís wedding.Without Dainesís vote and with Murkowskiís vote against Kavanaugh, all threeñFlake, Collins, and Manchinñas well as Vice President Mike Penceís tiebreak, are needed to confirm Kavanaugh. With Daines, merely two of the three will suffice.

And then I saw his response, which was overtly political, showed him to be what he really is, which is a political operative dressed in the robes of a judge, not someone whose temperament and whose words are befitting of the Supreme Court.

The information included personal phone numbers, emails, and employer phone numbers.ìYesterday, members of the Young Conservatives of Texas tabled with pro-Kavanaugh & anti-#MeToo signs on West Mall. They were swiftly confronted by a growing crowd of students, who made signs in protest, destroyed YCT signs, and chanted slogans like ëwe believe survivors!íî the far-left ASN group wrote in a blog post. ìWith women of color taking the initiative, the protests grew increasingly militant and also confronted the administration and the police enabling the YCT rally. Within two hours, the YCT had fled in the face of the massive backlash.îIn the post, the group encouraged readers to use the information provided in the blog post to ensure that the protesters face repercussions for defending Kavanaugh.ìWe encourage people to use these to wage campaigns and ensure there are repercussions for the actions they took yesterday. Demonstrating in defense of rapists and making campus hostile to survivors should not go unanswered. At the same time, students should prepare for backlash,î the blog post reads. ìAlready, one student is facing harassment and threats because of a video circulating from yesterday. Students should expect to organize solidarity campaigns against targeted harassment, and begin securing their own information to avoid harassment.îThe group encouraged readers to provide them with personal information on conservative faculty and students at the University of Texas at Austin.This week, a group of students destroyed signs carried by pro-Kavanaugh.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is helping the radical group MoveOn.org group raise money for an ìemergency campaignî to ìstopî the potential confirmation to the Supreme Court of nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Warren penned a blast email for MoveOn.org, which has been massively backed by billionaire George Soros, asking each supporter to ìchannel your anger into a weekly donation to MoveOn right now and help win the two most important fights we face right now: stopping Brett Kavanaugh and ending GOP control of Congress.îCalling Kavanaugh an ìentitled judicial hit man,î Warren used the ìemergency campaignî email to sow division: ìIím angry that while many women had to relive the worst days of their lives last week, powerful men are doing everything they can to help a powerful man get one of the most powerful jobs in the country.îWithout a trace of irony that she is raising funds for a group backed by a billionaire, Warren claimed that ìthe wealthy and well connected believe they are entitled to power.

Marsha†Blackburnís†(R-TN) Democrat opponent†Phil Bredesen announced his support Friday morning for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaughís confirmation.ìPresidents have the right to appoint justices who share their valuesñelections have consequences. †I believe a Senatorís responsibility to ëadvise and consentí is not a license to indulge in partisanship, but should focus on the qualifications of the nominee, their ethics and their temperament,î Bredesenís statement reads. ìI believed that Judge Kavanaugh initially met this test, and I was prepared to say ëyesí to his nomination prior to Dr. Fordís coming forward. †While the subsequent events make it a much closer call, and I am missing key pieces of information that a sitting Senator has, Iím still a ëyes.íîThe Democrat Senate candidate referred†to Ford as a ìheroineî and said the treatment of the California psychology†professor who recently†leveled a decades-old allegation of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh, as ìdisgusting,î adding that he is ìdetermined to help bring about a fairer and far more respectful treatment of these issues.îBredesen statement comes after the full Senate voted in favor of advancing Kavanaughís confirmation into its final phase. In a surprising move, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV)†voted†yes on cloture for Kavanaughís confirmation.In a Thursday interview with†Al-Jazeera, Manchin signaled he would decide whether to vote in favor of Kavanaugh based on the judgeís public service record ó not the FBIís investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct.ìI am looking at the gentleman as an adult from 22 to 53, thirty-one years of professional service,î he†told†the Qatar-based news outlet. ìI am looking at him as a father. As a person in a community, how he interacts with his community. I am trying to put the human side to it.îJudge Kavanaughís nomination to the Supreme Court passed 51-49. Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Susan Collins voted in support of Kavanaugh, while†Sen. Lisa†Murkowski†(R-AK) broke with her Republican colleagues with a ìnoî vote.†

The mob can attack and the Senate caves,î he said. ìOr weíll stand up and say that serious, thoughtful, fact-based deliberation will still define this body.îThe Senate majority leader made his remarks on the Senate floor ahead of the cloture vote on Friday morning. The vote passed 51-49.McConnell urged Senators to focus on fact-based evidence instead of uncorroborated allegations, reminding them of the ìpivotal dayî in the Senate.ìThe ideals of justice that have served our nation so well, for so long, are on full display,î he said.McConnell reviewed the left-wing process of the Kavanaugh accusations, calling them ìdisgraceful.î He slammed the Senate for focusing on Kavanaughís ìgoofy jokesî in a yearbook and his beer-drinking days in high school and college.ìThis is our approach to confirming a Supreme Court Justice? This is the Senateís contribution to public discourse?î McConnell asked in disbelief.He pointed to all of the accusers who recanted their accusations, despite the ìKeystone copsî trying to dig up more mud on Kavanaugh.ìThe uncorroborated mud and the partisan noise and the physical intimidation of members here in the Senate will not have the final say around here,î McConnell said. ìThe Senate will have the final say.îDespite McConnellís speech, one Republican senator voted against cloture ñ Sen. Lisa Murkowski. One Democrat voted for cloture ó Sen. Joe Manchin.The final confirmation vote will be held on Saturday.

Doug Jones (D-AL)† said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaughís†Wall Street Journal op-ed† apologizing for his emotional testimony was ìdisingenuous.îOn Kavanaughís op-ed, Jones said, ìIt was certainly not persuasive. I think what was persuasive was his testimony the other day which was clearly not off the cuff, which was clearly emotional and it should be. If this did not happen he should vigorously defend himself. He went beyond that. He went into partisan attacks, personal attacks on some senators, totally inappropriate, showing a temperament that is unbecoming a judge, much less a Supreme Court nominee. I think the op-ed piece was trying to throw a little cold water on that. But that is very, very serious. Itís one that helped tip the balance for me.îHe added, î I thought it was somewhat disingenuous because it appeared it was more off the cuff when he was reading. He had clearly had set this out. He set the tone. He knew exactly what he was going to say and he knew exactly the emotions. If he didnít then thatís I think more of a problem.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/gops-lisa-murkowski-endangers-kavanaugh-confirmation/,"Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) unexpectedly broke with her party Friday and voted against ending debate on Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, reinserting doubts over his final confirmation.The rest of the Republican Senate caucus ó including the two other Republicans who have most publicly wavered on Kavanaugh, Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Susan Collins (R-ME) ó voted for ìcloture,î to end debate and set up a final Saturday floor vote on Kavanaughís fate. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) joined with Republicans, yielding 51 total votes and avoiding the need for Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie despite Murkowskiís last-minute break.ìThis has truly been the most difficultÖ decision that Iíve ever had to make,î Murkowski told reporters, according to Reuters. ìI believe heís a good man. It just may be that in my view, heís not the right man for the court at this time.îThe fourth-term senator has long fostered a reputation as one of the Senateís most liberal Republicans. Throughout the Democratsí ongoing attempt to derail Judge Kavanaughís nomination, Murkowski has kept her cards close to her chest. Last week, she joined Flake and other reputed undecideds in supporting a seventh FBI background investigation of Judge Kavanaugh to focus on allegations of teenage sexual misconduct. Last Wednesday, she told CNN that such a probe†ìwould sure clear up all the questions, wouldnít it?îThat FBI investigation made its final report available to senators on Thursday. All reports indicate it contained no corroboration of any of the allegations against Kavanaugh.Nevertheless, Murkowski joined with Democrats in Fridayís cloture vote. The move places Kavanaughís confirmation, which had appeared very likely, in serious jeopardy. There is no indication Murkowski will change her vote to a yes in the final floor vote.With Sen. Steve Daines (R-MT) potentially unable to vote Saturday due to his daughterís Montana wedding, Republicans may now need Manchin to cross the aisle again to ensure confirmation, even assuming the other unannounced Republican vote ó Collins, who voted for cloture but will not announce her final voting intentions until Friday afternoon ó falls their way.Murkowskiís office did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding her cloture vote.Breitbart Newsís Sean Moran contributed to the reporting in this article.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/vice-president-mike-pence-may-have-to-cast-tiebreaking-vote-on-brett-kavanaugh/,"Vice President Mike Pence may have to cast the tie breaking vote on Saturday to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, thanks to a key Republican defection in Fridayís cloture vote to end Senate debate.Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) broke ranks and voted no, meaning that only 50 Republicans voted yes. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) crossed party lines to vote yes, giving cloture a thin 51-49 majority and setting up a final confirmation vote Saturday.Both Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Susan Collins (R-ME), who were previously undecided, voted yes on cloture. However, neither has yet indicated whether he or she will vote to confirm Kavanaugh. (Collins will announce her vote at 3 p.m. ET.)If both Flake and Collins vote no, then Brett Kavanaughís nomination will be defeated. Likewise, if Manchin votes against confirmation. But if Flake votes yes and Collins votes no, and both Murkoswki and Manchin stay in their respective columns, then there will be a 50-50 tie and the vice president will have to be called in to cast the deciding vote. If he does, it would be the first time in the history of the Supreme Court that a vice president has cast a deciding tiebreaker vote for confirmation.Pence anticipated that he might have to do so nearly a month ago, well before Christine Blasey Fordís uncorroborated claims of sexual assault had been launhed. He acknowledged, in a Sep. 9 interview with CBS Newsí†Face the Nation, that he could be called in to cast his vote. However, he said, ìWell, we hope not. Weíll see where we are.îHe tweeted Friday morning, following the cloture vote:Today, a majority in the Senate voted to advance the nomination of a good person & a great intellect to #SCOTUS ñ Judge Brett Kavanaugh.

Itís the Rape Party,î she tweeted.It's no longer the Republican Party to me. It's the Rape Party.ó Molly Ringwald (@MollyRingwald) October 4, 2018If Ringwald thought she would find a safe space on Twitter, though, she has been disabused of that notion with the hundreds of replies to her tweet taking her to task for her ignorant name calling.It also seems that Ringwald has forgotten that her side of the political aisle has its own ìrape partyî problems. What with Bill Clinton as its ringleader, the Democrats have such stellar persons as Democrat mega-donor Harvey Weinstein, Anthony Weiner, Ted Kennedy, Keith Ellison, Daniel Inouye, and a host of other lesser-known Democrats such as Donny Ray Williams, Brock Adams, Mel Reynolds, Fred Richmond, and many others, all having rape accusations (and in some cases convictions) hanging over them.Ringwald was also upset that her friend, comedienne Amy Schumer, was arrested for disturbing the peace in Washington D.C. on Thursday.

After all, many of her 80s films celebrated teen drinking, sexual promiscuity, and drug use. Indeed, even the actress herself recently noted that some of her past films are morally suspect. Having children of her own gave her a ìdifferent perspective,î apparently.But Ringwald is hardly alone with her dip into hardcore, left-wing politics during this Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process.Actor John Leguizamo had a Twitter meltdown this week, saying that the Republican Party is filled with ìsexual assaultersî and ìpedophiles.îABCís The View host Joy Behar also recently said that the GOP message to boys is that they are allowed to be ìgropersî if they grow up to be powerful.Twitter warrior Alissa Milano chimed in, as well,†informing MSNBC of her delicate mental state because she is ìfilled with rageî that the GOP is ìinstitutionalizing sexual abuse.îFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.

This is a consent decision about one person for one seat.îSasse, a staunch critic of President Donald Trump, also took aim at the presidentís remarks about Christine Blasey Ford, the California psychology professor who last month brought forth a decades-old sexual misconduct allegation against the Supreme Court nominee. ìWe all know that the president cannot lead us through this time,î the lawmaker said. ìWe know he is dispositionally unable to restrain his impulse to divide us.îIn an opinion-editorial published Thursday evening, Breitbart Newsís senior legal editor, Ken Klukowski, called on Sasse to put his issues with President Trumpís America First agenda and brash personal system aside and vote to confirm Kavanaugh, or risk ìblowing up the Supreme Court.îìSasse understands the Madisonian Dilemma from†The Federalist†No. 51, that if men were angels, no government would be necessary, but because those who serve in government are not angels either, the power of government must be constrained,î wrote†Klukowski. ìOne of those constraints Madison identifies is the separation of powers, and another is federalism.î

We honor their legacy by participating in our democracy through this civil disobedience.îLast week the board of directors took bold steps for the organization in calling for a complete FBI investigation into all allegations of sexual misconduct and Thursday they went a step farther in officially urging the Senate to reject Judge Kavanaughís nomination.ìThe process of the Kavanaugh hearings is unlike anything we have seen in the Leagueís 98 years,î said Chris Carson, president of the League. ìThis nominee has demonstrated that he does not possess fair and unbiased judicial temperament. I am proud of Virginia and our members across the country who are standing with her.îOn Thursday the League went a step farther by participating in the protests.ìI want to take the fear out of activism,î said Kase. ìThis is our Capitol. These are our Senators. This is our government. It is an honor to participate in our democracy and to live our mission: Empowering Voters.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/05/joe-biden-trump-supporters-have-cultish-devotion/,"Former Vice President Joe Biden told Democrats at Cal State Fullerton on Thursday that supporters of President Donald Trump have a ìcultish devotionî to their leader, choosing ìparty over countryî in supporting Judge Brett Kavanaugh.The Los Angeles Times reported:ìThe truth itself is being thrown aside in favor of a cultish devotion to the whims of one man,î Biden told hundreds of campaign volunteers Thursday at a Cal State Fullerton rally, citing the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.ìLook at the behavior of Republican senators during the recent testimony of Judge Kavanaugh. Look at the behavior of this president every day,î he said. ìLies have never been more brazen. Blind rage and brute partisanship has never been more palpable.îBiden, who is still considered a dark horse candidate for president in 2020 despite repeated denials, visited California this week to fundraise for Democrats and to campaign for the partyís congressional candidates. The Associated Press reported that candidates from five competitive districts attended the rally. Biden also reportedly told attendees that the upcoming midterm elections were ìmuch bigger than politics Ö†Our humanity is being tested.îThe former vice presidentís criticism of a Trump ìcultî echoes recent claims by Hollywood actress and activist Alyssa Milano that Trump uses a ìcult-like forceî to communicate with supporters.Ironically, Bidenís criticism echoes criticism of then-President Barack Obama, who spoke of his own election as ìthe moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal,î and whose supporters followed him with a quasi-religious devotion, portraying him as a spiritual ìLightworker.î Some journalists even compared Obama to God.Joel B.

Her lawyer wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee last month: ìSimply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.îWhen Rachel Mitchell, the Arizona sex crimes prosecutor appointed by the committeeís GOP majority to lead questioning in last weekís public hearing, asked Ford about Keyserís denial, Ford claimed that her friend had ìsignificant health challengesî and that Keyser had texted her to apologize for her contrary testimony and offer support. (One of Keyserís relatives later told the†UK Daily Mail†angrily that Ford had thrown her lifelong friend ìunder the bus.î)In a subsequent interview with the FBI, conducted as part of the week-long supplemental background investigation requested by the Senate, Keyser reiterated that she did not know Kavanaugh and did not know anything about the alleged high school party.The†Journal noted that despite McLeanís alleged effort to influence Keyser, ìThere is no indication Dr. Ford and her legal team were involved in any effort to discuss Ms. Keyserís statement with her.îMcLean is a former FBI agent who is said to have worked as a spokesperson for Prett Bharara, a former staffer for Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) who went on to become the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York until he was fired by President Donald Trump shortly after the latter took office in 2017. Bharara has since emerged as one of the most vociferous opponents of President Trump in the media.Keyserís communications with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and her FBI interview, were conducted under penalty of perjury.Joel B.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/midterm-election/2018/10/05/blue-state-blues-chuck-schumer-democrats-are-sounding-scarier-than-trump/,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) seems to think the 1990s never ended. For the second time this year, he has called on the Democratsí playbook from the Clinton era. And for the second time, he has failed, spectacularly.In January, Schumer shut down the federal government, hoping to win as President Bill Clinton won in 1995-6, only to surrender without gaining anything. Now, just before the midterm elections, his effort to recreate the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill outrage is backfiring.Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) ó who hopes to become Speaker of the House again if Democrats win in November ó have shown Americans exactly how Capitol Hill would run if they were in charge. Obstruction, protests, left-wing mobs ó and, worst of all, the attempted humiliation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, an upright man and devoted public servant.Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition, but thatís what the Democrats have on their agenda if they retake Congress.The 2018 midterms were supposed to be all about President Donald Trump and his ìstyle.îThen Schumerís team turned the Kavanaugh hearings into the Salem witch trials, and now Democrats sound worse than the president ó even to people who hate his rhetoric.That is the reality beneath the striking new poll numbers that show Republican voter enthusiasm surging to match Democratsí. Suddenly Republicans have a fighting chance to keep the House, and red-state Democrats are in trouble in key Senate races.There is more at work here than male voters suddenly feeling vulnerable, or feeling empathy for Kavanaugh in his torment. The electorate as a whole has watched Democrats trash basic principles of justice and destroy a good man for political gain.To many ó if not most ó Americans, that is far scarier, on a personal level, than Trump insulting the Attorney General or insulting journalists.If the principle of ìinnocent until proven guiltyî is destroyed, then none of us is safe from the state.Democrats made their own bed here, in two ways. First, they tried to turn the Kavanaugh hearings into a catalyst for another ìYear of the Woman,î which Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has been conjuring since the #metoo movement first appeared on the scene in 2017.Feinstein, who withheld Dr. Christine Blasey Fordís accusations until after the formal confirmation hearings were over, has played a key role in this debacle ó one that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) now says must be fully investigated.Second, Democrats have been telling the world for five years that the criminal justice system is fundamentally broken ó that cops shoot African-Americans and Latinos with little hesitation and few consequences; that our courts treat poor and minority defendants worse than white defendants; and that private prison operators scheme to keep the flow of inmates high.These claims, true or not, have been effective: they are chiefly responsible for the steep decline in race relations that began in 2013.Brett Kavanaugh is a son of privilege and is already, on the D.C. Circuit, one of the most powerful and esteemed judges in the whole system. But Democrats have been so successful in popularizing the idea that justice is basically a matter of politics and prejudice that it is not hard to see him, sitting before the Senate Judiciary Committee, as a victim, like others.Indeed, nothing has been so persuasive on that point as the spectacle of watching Kavanaughlife nearly ruined in mere days over an unproven accusation.At Schumerís urging, Democrats have pushed ahead, knowing that their base in the so-called ìResistanceî wants to see them fight hard. At first, Democratsí tactics were merely disruptive ó like coordinating with each other to interrupt the confirmation hearing, or defending the protestersí absurd outbursts from the gallery.But when Democrats started hyping Fordís allegations ó coordinating with activist lawyers and the liberal media ó they unleashed something much more frightening, recalling the worst days of the McCarthy hearings.Schemer promoted the vicious lie that Kavanaugh faced ìmultiple, corroborated allegations.î None of the allegations has been corroborated ó in fact, they have been contradicted by all the key witnesses.The left tried to laugh when Graham ó for years, a voice for bipartisanship in judicial confirmations ó finally had enough, and told Democrats the truth to their faces: that they had destroyed the system for the sake of power.Leftists took snapshots of an angry Graham, in mid-tirade, and called him the ìhideous hateful faceî of male intolerance. They failed to realize they were looking at their own reflection.It should have been hard to outdo Trump for fear. But Democrats did it ó and now Republicans now have a chance.They can thank Schumer, who forgot what Republicans learned the hard way in 1998: voters donít like inquisitions.Joel B.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/10/04/boxer-history-will-not-be-kind-to-republicans-who-hide-behind-make-believe-fbi-probe/,"Thursday on MSNBCís ìAll In,î former Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) said history would not be kind to Republicans in the Senate who hide behind the FBI expanded investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Boxer said, ìAll those years ago when I came in the year of the woman, you know, in 1992 when I got elected, this goes back to Anita Hill. Whenever there is a woman who comes forward, very credible, very believable, she gets treated horribly. Now, they tried not to do that to Dr. Ford. But all that broke down.îShe added, ìThey even had a woman assistant to question her, as Mitch McConnell called her. It was ridiculous. Guess what happened then? There were corroborating witnesses who would have said, yes, Anita is right, Professor Hill is right, and they were cooling their heels. What do we have here? Forty people at my count as I read all the news reports, including NBC, who were waiting to corroborate exactly what the two women who came forward said. And they were left cooling their heels. This is not justice, and so itís more than even the partisanship. There is such a thing as right and wrong. This is really about a woman and yet a second woman who came forward and said this man hurt me. And the first thing the Republicans did was this make-believe investigation, you know, a wink and a nod investigation, Jeff Flake,†Sue Collins†and Lisa Murkowski, who wisely called for an investigation, should not hide behind it because history will not treat them kindly. The truth has a way of coming out.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

But if needed, as Breitbart News has learned per a source close with Sen.

He says he'll be walking his daughter down the aisle at her Montana wedding, regardless of the #KavanaughVote that could take place this weekend. #NBCMontana #mtpol #mtnews #Kavanaughó Maritsa Georgiou (@MaritsaNBCMT) October 4, 2018The news of Daines not being there on Saturday came less than an hour before Mitch McConnell announced the cloture vote on Friday:The Senate will be in session at 9:30 tomorrow morning. Under the regular order, the vote to advance the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court will be at 10:30.ó Leader McConnell (@senatemajldr) October 4, 2018Almost immediately, leftists and media figures rejoiced ó thinking it would delay the confirmation vote again or, worse for Kavanaugh, spell doom for his chances at confirmation:HAHAHAHAHA.Congratulations to Steve Daines' daughter, but also Republicans can't confirm Kavanaugh (as they plan to do this weekend) without him. https://t.co/RX0RSnkMwkó Sarah Mimms (@mimms) October 4, 2018https://twitter.com/mattyglesias/status/1047985476827828226A Supreme Court nomination vote being pushed back because it conflicts with Steve Daines' daughter's wedding would be such a perfectly American ending to this saga. https://t.co/A1sBPsDcJ4ó Paul McLeod (@pdmcleod) October 4, 2018GOP senator Steve Daines can't give his daughter's reproductive rights away on Saturday because he'll be giving her away to her husband in Montana.I'm calling it. Irony is dead. https://t.co/h5q6MO65rWó Kaz Weida (@kazweida) October 4, 2018But, as Breitbart News can report here, the senator spoke with Kavanaugh and has arrangements lined up to make it back in time if necessary on Saturday night ó something that may set up a contentious Saturday evening where the vote may be held open for some time. And Daines spoke with Trump Jr., who confirmed the news on Twitter:.@SteveDaines is a good friend and hunting/fishing buddy and as far as his vote this weekend is concerned he tells me he has it covered. Coming from this man you can take that to the bank!ó Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 5, 2018ìAnyone who knows Sen. Daines knows that he is a conservative champion who has fought tooth and nail for all of President Trumpís judicial nominees,î Andy Surabian, a senior adviser to Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign and former White House official, told Breitbart News. ìHe helped lead the fight to confirm Justice Gorsuch and never for a moment wavered on Kavanaugh. So it comes as no surprise to me that if his vote is needed this weekend, he will find a way to be in Washington, DC.îDainesí vote may not be needed in the end. Currently, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats in the U.S. Senate. Kavanaugh only needs a bare minimum of 50 votes to be confirmed, meaning if all other Republicans vote for him while all Democrats vote against him and Daines is absent, he would be confirmed, 50-49. If one Republican breaks against Kavanaugh and all Democrats oppose Kavanaughís confirmation, Dainesí vote would be needed and then Vice President Mike Pence would be standing by to cut a 50-50 tie in the Senate.At this juncture, only a handful of senators remain undecided. Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Ben Sasse (R-NE) comprise the GOP side of undecided senators. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) is the only undecided Democratic senator.Sasse is, according to his office, leaning yes, and Flake has shown positive signs, as has Collins ó while Murkowski has been quieter. Manchin, meanwhile, faces a tough re-election in West Virginia, where his GOP opponent Attorney General Patrick Morrisey has been hammering him on Kavanaugh, putting enormous pressure on the Democrat to back the highly qualified judge for the Supreme Court. It remains to be seen how each will vote.Now that a potential disaster ó wherein an absence by Daines would mean Republicans could afford to lose none of the undecided Republicans if Manchin does vote no ó has been averted by the Montana Republicanís assurances that he has travel arrangements lined up in case of emergency, it means Kavanaugh is on a clearer path to eventual likely confirmation.Steve Daines tells @tedbarrettcnn that he would fly back after the wedding Saturday, arriving early Sunday morning for a confirmation vote if his vote is needed, so theyíd have to hold the vote open. ìIíd come back after the wedding.î https://t.co/I7uyxPSNboó Manu Raju (@mkraju) October 5, 2018It would, in the end, however, mean more drama in the U.S. Senate as the vote would remain open late into the evening Saturday until potentially early Sunday.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/why-undecided-senators-should-vote-to-confirm-kavanaugh/,"Jeff Flake and Ben Sasse are NeverTrump, but they have always called for limited government and faithfully interpreting the Constitution.With the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh discredited, confirming him to the Supreme Court would be the greatest victory for limited constitutional government those senators could ever deliver, advancing their vision for Americaís future. It could create the first conservative Court in decades.Flake and Sasse come from different backgrounds and focus on different priorities. But for each of them, the issues they ran for office to advance would take a quantum leap forward with Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court.For Flake, ever since his days as the executive director of the Goldwater Institute in Phoenix, his focus has been on a federal government of limited reach, on deregulation, and on free-market economics.For Sasse, it is a more philosophical matter of a government that strictly adheres to the Constitution, and nurturing a culture of private morality and public virtue.The reality is this: There has not been a broad-based conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court for decades. It is likely that Kavanaugh will be the crucial fifth vote to give life to Flake and Sasseís vision. It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for them.Flake understands that limited government endures only when people govern themselves. His statements throughout almost 20 years in public office contemplate the reality that government is legitimized coercion, and so the scope of government needs to be limited in order for people to be free to pursue opportunity and raise their families as they see fit.Sasse understands the Madisonian Dilemma from The Federalist†No. 51, that if men were angels, no government would be necessary, but because those who serve in government are not angels either, the power of government must be constrained. One of those constraints Madison identifies is the separation of powers, and another is federalism.Both senators extol Thomas Jeffersonís belief that Americaís republican system enshrined in the Constitution requires ìvirtuous citizensî to succeed, where values are instilled in the next generation and people act as individuals and families in an honorable and productive fashion, with faith in something greater than self and living a life in pursuit of noble aspirations.Kennedy was often the deciding vote on cases that abandoned free market policies or the Constitutionís structural safeguards of liberty. For both Flake and Sasse, Kavanaughís replacing Kennedy could become a dream come true.For example, in 2005 Kennedy was the fifth vote in Kelo v. New London, where the Supreme Court held that government can seize a private home to give to a developer who demolishes the house to build a strip mall. Conservatives dissented, saying the Constitutionís Takings Clause only permits the government to take property for public purposes (like building roads), and only if the owner receives fair market value.And in 2007, Kennedy was the fifth vote in Massachusetts v. EPA, where the Court held that a state has standing to sue the federal government to force the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate CO2 as a pollutant. The conservative justices argued that even if global warming is happening and is caused by human activity, regulating every U.S. source of CO2 leaves 80 percent of greenhouse emissions worldwide untouched, and therefore that Article III of the Constitution does not give federal courts jurisdiction to decide these matters.On these and many other issues, a Justice Kavanaugh would restore the rule of law and give full force to constitutional rights. He is an originalist, who believes in interpreting the Constitution according to the original public meaning of its provisions, and a textualist who believes that federal laws must be interpreted according to the clear meaning of their text, regardless of the judgeís policy preferences.At the same time, Kavanaughís confirmation would not imperil priorities for moderate senators, so they too should feel comfortable voting for him.Kavanaughís confirmation does not endanger Obamacare. He replaces Justice Anthony Kennedy, who voted with the three solidly conservative justices to strike down the Affordable Care Act entirely. The fifth vote to save Obamacare came from a moderate-conservative, Chief Justice John Roberts, who is not going anywhere.Nor should Kavanaughís confirmation give Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) or Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) pause. Only one sitting justiceñ Justice Clarence Thomas ñ has said he would overrule Roe v. Wade, and there is little reason to think that with Kavanaugh there would be a five-justice majority to do so.But regarding the scope of federal power and the role of government, Kavanaughís confirmation would pave the way to keep the courts out of the debate between policymakers and businesses, to permit states and local communities to take the lead on issues where the Constitution does not put Washington, DC, in charge, and to give full effect to enumerated constitutional rights such as free speech, religious liberty, and the Second Amendment.These undecided senators need to resist the temptation to think that if Kavanaugh were voted down, President Trump would nominate someone they like even better. To the contrary, a failed Supreme Court nomination is a kidney punch to any presidency.Aside from the tax cuts, Republicans and conservatives think that the only worthwhile thing Senate Republicans manage to do is confirm President Trumpís excellent judges. It is possible that a failed nomination could supercharge the Right to show up to increase their Senate margin. It is more likely that voters would decide that Senate Republicans are pathetic, GOP turnout would collapse, and Democrats could take charge of the upper chamber.Should that happen, then Kennedyís seat would stay open until January 2021 after the next presidential inauguration. If an additional seat opens up, then the Court would continue with only seven justices, instead of eight or nine. Federal law requires only six justices for the Court to have a quorum to decide cases. Expect Democrats to cite that law as justification for blocking nominees as vacancies occur.Even if Flake, Sasse, or other senators are undecided in part because they do not get along with the president, they must realize that blowing up the Supreme Court ñ and with it the first chance in decades to restore key constitutional rights and safeguards ñ is not the way to vent their frustration. And the Kavanaughs are a beautiful family who deserve better, in any event.The Senate should confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/rrepublicans-look-strong-in-competitive-florida-house-races/,"Republican candidates are looking strong in the seven competitive House races in districts represented by GOP members in Florida, a key battleground state won by Donald Trump in 2016.That bullish outlook comes from President Trumpís rising popularity in the state, an energized base reacting to the Democrat smearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh,† and potential coat tails from two strong candidates at the top of the ballot in key statewide races: Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican nominee challenging incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) in the Senate race, and former Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL-06), who is battling left wing Democrat nominee Andrew Gillum in the gubernatorial contest.Democrats need to pick up at least three seats from Republicans in Floridaís 27 member delegation in the House of Representatives in order to have the best chance of obtaining the net gain of 23 seats they need to take back the majority there, but barely five weeks from election day, they are not favored to pick up a single district in Florida.Only eight of the stateís 27 Congressional races are competitive, according to the Cook Political Reportís most recent rating of competitive House races. One of those competitive racesñthe 7th Congressional Districtñis currently held by a Democrat, while seven are currently held by Republicans.In July, Breitbart News identified these seven GOP-held competitive seats in Florida as among the 61 GOP-held competitive seats Republicans must win in November (along with flipping three Democrat-held seats) in order to maintain a majority in the House of Representatives.Now in the first week of October, two and a half months later, not a single one of those seven Republican-held seats are currently rated by the Cook Political Report as as ìLikely Democraticî or ìLean Democratic,î though the number of must-win GOP-held seats across the country has increased to 65.One of those seven GOP-held seatsñthe 27th Congressional District in Miami, currently represented by Rep. Ilyana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL-27)ñwas rated ìLikely Democraticî as recently as July, given its heavily Hispanic demographics.But the narrow Democratic primary victory in August by 77-year-old Donna Shalala, the former Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Bill Clinton administration, and the emergence of a rising Republican star as her general election opponent, former Spanish language broadcaster Maria Elvira Salazar, has catapulted the race from ìLikely Democraticî to ìToss-up,î as Breitbart News reported last week.The†Sunshine State News†reported†that Salazar ìhas been remarkably efficient in using her name strength in Congressional District 27 to her advantage, and has turned this into a competitive race.îSalazar also speaks both Spanish and English, while Shalala speaks only English, a key disadvantage for her because†ìthe district is heavily Latino, with 57 percent of the registered voters being Hispanic.îìSalazar also has an edge beyond her name advantage ó she can campaign comfortably in the area to most audiences because she is bi-lingual; Shalala is not,î the†Sunshine State News†notedJust as Hillary Clinton failed to generate the requisite enthusiasm among Florida voters to win the stateís electoral college votes in the 2016 Presidential election, the enthusiasm gap for Shalala among rank and file Democrats in the 27th Congressional District is palpable.On Thursday the Cook Political Report moved the race in the adjacent 26th Congressional District from ìLean Republicanî to ìToss-up,î but, as NBC reported on Wednesday, the only poll that shows the race tied comes from the campaign of his Democratic challenger:The tight race has Cuban-American Republican congressman Carlos Curbelo in a virtual tie with his Democratic challenger, Ecuadorian-born Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, according to a recent poll commissioned by her campaign. Earlier polls had the moderate, two-term lawmaker winning by a wider margin.Curbelo and Mucarsel Powell are campaigning to represent Floridaís 26th district, which is 70 percent Latino. It stretches from southwest Miami-Dade, all the way down to Key West and includes parts of the Everglades and the Gulf Coast.The open 15th Congressional District, currently represented by Rep. Dennis Ross (R-FL-15), plus the 16th Congressional District, currently represented by Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-FL-16), are currently rated as ìLean Republicanî by the Cook Political Report.Three competitive races in Florida are rated as ìLikely Republicanî by the Cook Political Report: the 18th Congressional District, where Rep. Brian Mast (R-FL-18) is running for re-election, the 25th Congressional District, where Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL-25) is running for re-election, and the open seat in the 6th Congressional District held by gubernatorial candidate DeSantis.Though the old political saw that ìall politics is local,î is often used to describe the outcome of Congressional elections, the 2018 midterms now appear to revolve around a single national question: Do you support the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh by President Trump to serve on the Supreme Court?In Florida, as elsewhere, the answer to that key question, increasingly, appears to be ìyes.îAfter a precipitous drop of net job approval ratings from +22 in January 2017 to -1 in July 2017, President Trumpís net job approval rating in the state has steadied at +2 in September, according to the Morning Consult Poll.On Thursday, Rasmussen Reports released a new poll that shows nationwide President Trumpís job approval rating has reached 50 percent, two points higher than the 48 percent job approval rating former President Obama had at the same point in his first term.The recent jump in Republican enthusiasm nationwide in the past week thanks to the Democrat smear tactics deployed in the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, documented in this NPR/Marist Poll released on Wednesday, is taking place in Florida as well, and that is expected to further strengthen the position of the Republican candidates in these seven competitive races over the next several weeks.As for the top of the ticket in the midterms, the latest polls show that Republican nominee Gov. Rick Scott is moving upwards, and that trend is likely to continue, given incumbent Sen. Bill Nelsonís decision to vote no on the Kavanaugh confirmation.A Quinnipiac Poll†conducted between September 20 and September 24 showed Nelson leading by seven points. The most recent poll, conducted by Mason Dixon between September 24 and September 27, shows that Nelsonís lead has dwindled to one point.Former Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL-06), the Republican nominee for governor, had a rough start after pulling off a bit of an upset in the GOP primary, but he has gained ground in recent weeks as the left wing record of the Democrat nominee, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, has come increasingly to light.Gillumís†nine point†lead in the Quinnipiac Poll†conducted between September 20 and September 24 has dropped to just†one point†in the Mason Dixon Poll conducted between September 24 and September 27.Democrats are still within striking distance of taking back a majority in the House of Representatives come November.But a little more than five weeks before election day, it appears that they will need to look to states other than Florida to pick up the net gains they need to accomplish that.

Steve Daines says heís going to attend his daughterís wedding back home in Montana on Saturday regardless of a possible weekend Senate vote on embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Daines told The Associated Press Thursday in a statement that two things are going to happen this weekend: Thereís going to be a new Supreme Court justice and Daines is going to walk his daughter down the aisle.Daines has supported Kavanaugh throughout a confirmation process thatís turned increasingly bitter following sexual assault and misconduct allegations against the nominee.The senatorís spokeswoman, Katie Schoettler, says Daines read the FBI report on the allegations and saw no evidence corroborating claims made by Christine Blasey Ford and two other women.She says Daines believes itís time the confirmation moves forward.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/kavanaugh-i-am-an-independent-impartial-judge/,"Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Brett Kavanaugh defended his testimony in response to uncorroborated sexual assault allegations and his impartial record as a judge.Against that backdrop, I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend my family, my good name and my lifetime of public service. My hearing testimony was forceful and passionate. That is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me. At times, my testimonyóboth in my opening statement and in response to questionsóreflected my overwhelming frustration at being wrongly accused, without corroboration, of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record and character. My statement and answers also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled.I was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times. I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said. I hope everyone can understand that I was there as a son, husband and dad. I testified with five people foremost in my mind: my mom, my dad, my wife, and most of all my daughters.Going forward, you can count on me to be the same kind of judge and person I have been for my entire 28-year legal career: hardworking, even-keeled, open-minded, independent and dedicated to the Constitution and the public good. As a judge, I have always treated colleagues and litigants with the utmost respect. I have been known for my courtesy on and off the bench. I have not changed. I will continue to be the same kind of judge I have been for the last 12 years. And I will continue to contribute to our country as a coach, volunteer, and teacher. Every day I will try to be the best husband, dad, and friend I can be. I will remain optimistic, on the sunrise side of the mountain. I will continue to see the day that is coming, not the day that is gone.Read the rest of the story at the Wall Street Journal.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/10/04/sam-rohrer-prayer-america-bbn-tonight/,"American Pastors Network†(APN)†President Sam Rohrer shared a prayer requesting Godís assistance to guide Americans back to biblical principles on Wednesdayís edition of SiriusXMís Breitbart News Tonight. He offered his invocation at the conclusion of an interview with Breitbart Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.Rohrer appealed, ìOur dear heavenly Father who is our creator, the establisher of all that we have, the source of all truth, and the basis upon which this nation was founded, our justice system, our system of law, our separation of power, our understanding of right and wrong, and moral truth, all of those things, Lord, come from you. We recognize that you are the source of that.îLISTEN:Rohrer added, ìWe also recognize, Lord, that as a nation, we once embraced that ideology. We once embraced the concept of absolute truth and accountability to a God who created us, but Lord, we have walked away from it, and as our own courts have done, and many in government have done, we have taken that which you have said to be true and we have made it false.îRohrer continued: We have taken the sacred life given to every person, and we have made it legal to murder those who are in the womb of our moms, and Lord, we have shed innocent blood. We have redefined what marriage is in this country despite what you have said. We have witnessed, increasingly, the embracing of deception rather than truth. Running from accountability into pragmatism of all types. Lord, we have done these things to our harm.He went on: ìNow we find ourselves as a nation, in trouble, divided ó but divided really along the lines, Lord, not of what the purpose of government necessarily is but really on who You are and what Your role is.îRohrer pleaded: I would pray, Lord, on behalf of our nation that was established on Judeo-Christian principles coming right off of the pages of scripture, engraved right on the buildings and walls of Washington, in our very own state capital, we recognize that, Lord ó I would ask that you would have mercy upon us and that we would return to You in the recognition that truth exists, that you are the author of it, and that we have walked away from it. We donít have the answers, Lord, but you do. May we run to the source of truth in these days, and may we with open hands lifted, look to You for the direction to give to us now which we can find in Your word, as our founders and those who went before us knew and followed.Rohrer concluded, ìWe need your help, Lord. Our country is at risk. The very foundations of government are being threatened. We need help beyond the political. We need help beyond the pundits and the press. We need divine assistance today. We come to you. We pray in your name. Amen.îRohrer described APNís mission:American Pastors Network is a ministry that is geared to and focuses on the pulpit and its role in America on proclaiming the truth. It was the pulpit that actually drove the founding of this nation and built into the framework of our law and nation the Judeo-Christian ideology, which was the basis for our law, and it really is the position from which God has established moral truth and moral authority that underpins our law and justice and all that weíve come to appreciate as freedom in this holy experiment in self-government.Americaís problems will not be solved entirely through politics, warned Rohrer.ìI also believe, that without a doubt, the political office is not the solution to our problems in America,î said Rohrer. ìIt really comes from the pulpit, and our relationship and understanding that God is the creator of all that we have and He has established a very clear framework for how the family should function, and the individual, and the church, and civil government; the four institutions of authority.Restoration of Americaís freedoms must be rooted in a realignment with Judeo-Christian values, assessed Rohrer.Rohrer remarked, ìWe believe that if there is going to be a return and reclaiming of freedoms already lost in this country, and that which is so tremendously under attack as we see all around us but manifested, I think, in a clear way in this Kavanaugh circumstance. If we donít understand that God has laid out a plan for this nation, weíve been blessed by it, we have departed from it, and unless we return to Him, we stand in great jeopardy of losing all that we have been given.îRohrer linked the battle over Judge Brett Kavanaughís nomination to the Supreme Court linked to metaphysical struggle between good and evil.ìNow is the time to be standing up with the truth, not to be running from it,î advised Rohrer. ìWe called for a day of prayer today in regard to the circumstances in Washington because we do believe that this is not just a political struggle that we are watching but that it is literally a spiritual ideological battle between good and evil. it is something we must deal with in a very serious matter, and we think that going to God in prayer is where we must start.îRohrer added, ìThe example of what we are seeing is the result of rejecting those basic principles that have undergirded our system of justice which was built on biblical principles.îRohrer continued, ìJustice, biblically, starts with truth, it is balanced with mercy, and is supplied equitably to all. Thatís what the bible says, thatís also what Lady Justice says in her picture when sheís on the Supreme Court building with her eyes covered, the scale is in one hand, truth and mercy there in balance. Our Founders knew that. Thatís a biblical principle. When thatís done, then, in fact, you have justice.îRohrer added, ìBut what we have been witnessing with this matter in Washington is nothing at all thatís related to truth, and it is certainly not being done even in keeping with the protocols of our own law, let alone what biblical principles would say about that.îRoher said, ìNo accusation was ever to be entertained from one person against another only from the mouth of one witness. It had to be established in the mouths of two or three witnesses ó who had to be corroborated ó in agreement. Two or three witnesses had to say the same thing.îRohrer referenced Deuteronomy 19:15 and subsequent verses related to biblical standards for the consideration of witnesses alleging crimes against others.ìThe purpose of [authorities consulting witnesses] would be to determine the veracity of the claim, of the allegation, to determine where or not the witness was, in fact, legitimate and truthful,î explained Rohrer. Rohrer continued, ìIt would determine whether there was truth or error, whether or not it was a false witness or a true witness. That did not happen in D.C. It was not about determining the veracity of the witness. It was about how the witness felt and a whole host of other things.îRohrer discussed the importance of determining the veracity of accusations and the presumption of innocence lying with the accused.Rohrer stated: It was so important, in the maintenance of justice, that God told the leaders of Israel that when a false charge was brought up, they were to move swiftly to identify the veracity of the accuser, and the burden of proof was on the accuser, not the accused. And if it was found that that was a false witness, then the law was to be brought against all of the false witnesses, and they were to be given an equivalent penalty to the degree that which they raised the accusation and hoped that the accused would get some kind of punishment.Rohrer added, ìGod calls it an evil. False accusations are an evil that need to be purged. If it is not done, if it is not purged ó and the false witnesses and those that co-conspire along with it ó actually given the penalty of law that they wish to heap on someone else, if that does not happen, the justice system completely falls apart.îRohrer warned, ìOur entire justice system is being threatened and many of our own caretakers ó our senators and others ó seem to care little about that. Thatís a frightening thing.îBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

Judge has already given two sworn statements under penalty of felony that stated he does not recall the party or Kavanaugh assaulting Ford.Penny Starr/Breitbart NewsAfter the final FBI investigation found no corroboration for Fordís claims, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) on Wednesday launched the final round of the confirmation battle, filing for cloture to ensure a final vote on Kavanaughís confirmation by the end of the week.Penny Starr/Breitbart NewsThe organizers of the protest are the same left-wing organizations that have opposed Trump since he was elected in 2016 and are using the ongoing demonstrations to raise funds for their cause and register Democratic voters, including: the George Soros-funded†moveon.org;†the Womenís March, co-founded by anti-Semite and anti-Israel Linda Sarsour; Planned Parenthood; and Black Lives Matter.Video also shows protesters chasing and screaming at Sen.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/democrats-furious-after-fbi-probe-clears-kavanaugh-cover-up-sham-whitewash/,"Democrat senators are livid Thursday, decrying the FBIís probe into uncorroborated sexual misconduct allegations against the judge as a ìcover-upî and a ìsham,î†as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaughís confirmation†moves into its final stages.Speaking before reporters earlier Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Judiciary Committee†member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) criticized†the FBIís decision to leave Kavanaugh and†Christine†Blasey†Ford off its list of interviewees, blaming the White House, without citing any evidence, for what they described†as a ìlimitedî probe.ì[W]hat I can say is that the most notable part of this report is whatís not in it. As we noted by the White House, the FBI did not interview Brett Kavanaugh, nor did the FBI interview Dr. Blasey Ford,î Feinstein said. ìCandidly, what we reviewed today, in a very limited time, I was there. I had to leave. The report is in parts, and I had the opportunity to read some, but not all of it. It looks to be a product of an incomplete investigation that was limited, perhaps by the White House. I donít know.îIn the same press conference, Schumer claimed his numerous concerns over the FBIís handling of the investigation had ìbeen realizedî and accused the White House of ìgreatly constrain[ing] the investigation from the get-go.îì[W]e had many fears that this was a very limited process that would constrain the FBI from getting all the facts. Having received a thorough briefing on the documents, those fears have been realized,î he said.The lawmakerís concerns were shared by†Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), who told CNNís†New Day that the expectations of the FBIís investigation were not met.†ìOver the last couple of days, thereís been a fair amount of back and forth about what we asked for, what was promised and now today weíll see whatís delivered,î said Coons. ìIím concerned that if they never interviewed†Dr.†Christine Blasey Ford or her corroborating witnesses, if they never†interviewed many of Judge†Kavanaughís classmates from Yale who came forward to be heard about the alleged incident with Debbie Ramirez, that this isnít the investigation I was hoping for.îRather than vent to reporters, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) voiced his staunch disapproval of the investigation†and, akin to†his Democrat†colleague Sen. Feinstein, alluded to supposed White House interference†in the probe, without laying out any specific examples how. ìI read the FBI report. This whole thing is a sham,î†Merkley tweeted. ìThis stunted, strangled investigation was designed to provide cover, not to provide the truth.î Shortly after, the Oregon†Democrat referenced the Bureauís conclusion†as an example of a ìhorrific cover-upîFailed vice-presidential candidate Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) blasted what he described as a ìshameî investigation and complained over measures taken by the FBI to contain details of its findings from leaking to the press. ìThe whole thing is sham. Five days to do the investigation,î Kaine complained.†ìAnd so, here is what they do. There is now a report. One copy. Only one copy thatís available in the Senate SCIF. So they donít want 100 senators to read it. Iím not allowed to discuss it. The public canít see it. Itís a complete sham.îFlanked by far-left Islamist activist†Linda Sarsour, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) told a†raucous crowd of anti-Kavanaugh protesters outside a D.C. federal courthouse that Kavanaughís impassionate defense against uncorroborated†accusations of sexual misconduct disqualified him from the Supreme Court.†ìI watched that hearing last Thursday, and I believe Dr. Ford,î Warren said before the angry demonstrators. ìI watched that hearing last Thursday, and Brett Kavanaugh is disqualified.îìI watched 11 men†ó powerful men†ó try to help another powerful man make it to another powerful position,î she continued. ìThis is about hijacking our Democracy.îDuring a conference call with reporters, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, whose pointed questioning of Kavanaughís integrity has earned scorn from President Donald Trump, characterized the probe as a ìwhitewash.îìIt smacks of a cover-up,î the Connecticut†Democrat claimed. ìI am deeply disappointed, not in the FBI, but the work product here that is the result of straight-jacketing by the White House.îLeading up to the Bureauís wrap up of the probe, some Democrats had already begun to downplay its findings as to whether Kavanaughís confirmation should move to the full Senate. In a press conference, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) demanded Republicans replace Kavanaugh with another candidate, pointing to his testimony as proof that the judge lacks the†moral fitness to sit on the United Statesí highest court.ìMy hope is, beyond the vicious partisan rancor that is going on, beyond the accusations, we donít lose sight of what this moral moment is about in this country, and ultimately†ask ourselves the question: is this the right person to sit on the highest court in the land for a lifetime appointment?î Booker told reporters on Capitol Hill. ìThis is a sacred institution and the people who should be on it ó whether you disagree with their political or judicial philosophy†at all ó the people who should be on the Supreme Court should preserve the integrity†of the court, and be beyond the reproach of these difficult partisan times.Despite the outrage expressed by Democrats, committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) affirmed in a statement Thursday that the FBI found ìno hintî of sexual assault in Kavanaughís past and said it was ìtime to voteî to confirm the judge.ìThereís nothing in it that we didnít already know. These uncorroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by Judge Kavanaugh, and neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations. Thereís also no contemporaneous evidence,î Grassley said. ìThis investigation found†no hint of misconduct†and the same is true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during Judge Kavanaghís 25 years of public service.îDespite the outrage expressed by Democrats, Republicans intend to hold a Friday procedural vote on Kavanaughís confirmation. A cloture motion filed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) just after 10:00 p.m. Wednesday allows Republicans to bring an official vote on judge before the full Senate, the final phase of the confirmation process.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/heidi-heitkamp-will-vote-against-kavanaugh/,"Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), trailing by double digits in her reelection campaign, revealed Thursday she will not join Republicans in voting to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.In an interview to air Thursday night on Fargo, North Dakota, ABC affiliate WDAY, Heitkamp put an end to speculation she might vote for President Donald Trumpís nominee, as she did last year with now-Justice Neil Gorsuch. At a June campaign rally, Trump predicted Heitkamp would oppose any nominee he picked to replace retired Justice Anthony Kennedy.ìThe process has been bad but, at the end of the day, you have to make a decision, and Iíve made that decision,î Heitkamp told WDAYís†Kevin Wallevand. ìI will be voting no on Judge Kavanaugh.îWDAY will air Heitkampís explanation of her reasoning Thursday evening, only 33 days away from her election showdown with Republican nominee Rep.†Kevin Cramer (R-ND).Heitkamp is a quinessential ìred state Democrat,î representing a state President Trump won by more than 35 points in 2016. As such, she kept her options open with regard to the Kavanaugh vote, even after much of the rest of her party coalesced around efforts to defeat his nomination with sexual misconduct allegations.Already facing a tough reelection fight, Heitkampís seat in the Senate fell into even greater jeopardy when the Kavanaugh affair began to drive Republican voter engagement. As Christine Blasey Ford; her lawyers, Deborah Katz and Michael Bromwich; Deborah Ramirez and the New Yorker reporters who publicized her allegation; Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer; Christine Swetnick and her lawyer, Michael Avenatti; Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats, and the entire left-leaning news media were unable to produce any contemporary corroboration to any of the decades-old allegations against Kavanaugh, polls began to show a groundswell of Republican anger that could decide battleground elections like Heitkampís.Heitkamp in particular seems to have suffered from the ìKavanaugh effectî in the polls. Two successive polls released this week show Cramer leading the race by double digits, while Heitkampís North Dakotan constituents want Kavanaugh confirmed by a margin of more than two-to-one.The Cramer campaign, in a statement responding to Heitkampís decision, seemed to suggest opposing Kavanaugh may be the death knell of her campaign. ìLETíS BE CLEAR ó††Heidi Heitkamp just failed North Dakota, and voters know it,î the statement reads. ìGiven that a majority of her constituents want this exemplary nominee confirmed, Heidi Heitkamp is on the wrong side of history, and†this will be the†last consequential vote of her career.îThe Cramer campaign statement also characterizes Heitkampís decision as a rapprochement†with the Democratic Partyís more left wing leadership. ìThe President was right. Heidi Heitkamp just sided with liberals Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to obstruct President Trump and oppose the exceptionally qualified Judge Brett Kavanaugh,î it reads.Heitkamp revealed her decision as news filtered out about the completion of the seventh FBI background investigation into Kavanaughís past. The new investigation had been a Democratic demand virtually since the first public mention of sexual misconduct allegations from Kavanaughís high school and college days. The probe was finally granted after Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) conditioned his vote on it, creating another week of delay in confirming Kavanaugh.The White House and Senate Republicans made confident statements Wednesday that the new report shows no new corroboration or evidence of misconduct. The FBI report, however, did nothing to satisfy the Democrats who long insisted on it. Senate Democrats immediately smeared the report as ìincomplete,î ìlimited,î and ìsmack[ing]†of a whitewash, even a cover-up.î†Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said his fears of an inadequate investigation were ìrealizedî and Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) said the report was ìmost notableî for ìwhatís not in it.îEvidently, the FBI investigation also was not enough to sway Sen. Heitkamp into the ìyesî column.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/10/04/michelle-malkin-brett-kavanaugh-bar-fights-breitbart-news/,"Michelle Malkin joined Breitbart News Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak in mocking a New York Times report†highlighting a 1985 incident in which Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh was questioned by police about throwing ice in a bar altercation during his junior year of college. They made fun of the event on Wednesdayís edition of SiriusXMís Breitbart News Tonight.Pollak joked, ìCan I just make a pitch for the good old fashioned bar fight as a minimal qualification for office? I think since in California, for example, we are placing quotas so that companies have to appoint women to boards, so women now have an advantage, I think that men should show their credentials by participating in at least one bar fight.îLISTEN:Pollak quipped, ìNow, there are a couple of ground rules, here. You canít do it as a mature adult. It would have to be, sort of, before age 25, and that you have to win. You can have one loss, okay, youíve got to take a few punches, but you have to have a positive win-loss percentage, above .500, letís say.îPollak added, ìI think that a bar fight for the right reason, if youíre defending a woman, for example, or youíre standing up to white supremacist in a bar, and as crazy as this sounds, Iíve actually had to do that, that has to be positive on any resume for the highest court int he land, because there are some kinds of justice ó can I say this? ó sometimes street justice is the only justice.îMalkin jokingly approved, ìJoel, I second this motion. My question is, what arsenal qualifies? Because weíve got ice, and that doesnít seem to be going over very well with the media, Iím thinking those little paper umbrellas that they put in the cocktails.îPollak used a double entendre, ìFrom a very early age he has supported ice, contrast that to the Democrats who want to abolish ICE. There are certain Breitbart readers, if you tell them he threw the ICE at an illegal alien in a bar, that would be sort of ultimate poetry.îEarlier in the interview, Malkin noted the ìprofessional infrastructureî of left-wing and partisan Democrat agitation campaigns while lamenting the non-existence of an equivalent on the conservative side. She drew on a Wednesday-published column of hers entitled, ìInvestigate the Senate Democrat Wrecking Machine.îMalkin said Democrats and leftists ìexecuted their plan brilliantlyî in opposition to Kavanaughís nomination. ìRepublicans are never prepared forî such organized political campaigns, she added.Malkin said, ìExcuses are made [for] why our side never has boots on the ground, and I really do think itís time that somebody invest in full-time conservative protesters to make sure that these optics are balanced with people who support Brett Kavanaugh, support the rule of law, and support due process.îMalkin added, ìWe have to stop ó especially those who are considered more mainstream in the conservative movement ó demonizing those independent operators out there who are trying to fulfill this role. In so many ways this is what Andrew Breitbart talked about and why there was so much tension within the Beltway establishment part of the right and all the newcomers and true mavericks ó what a word that has been perverted by the likes of John McCain and his heirs ó but true mavericks who were really willing to put their mouths and their money and their lives on the line to fight for our cause.îMalkin said congressional Democrats coordinate with left-wing ìadvocacy groupsî and their news media allies, suspecting the protesters opposing Kavanaugh of having ìtop-down coordination with Senate Democrats.îMalkin stated, ìThe other inequity, the other imbalance, between the left and the right on this is Ö accuser procurement. You had an entire Senate Judiciary staff mechanism, I believe ó this has been in the works for months, now ó† sending out the bat signal to all the advocacy groups on the left, and I believe thatís feminists, #MeToo movement-types, [and] these encrusted lawyers like Debra Katz.îMalkin described the Democratsí ìprocurementî of Debra Ramirez ó who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct ó as ìvery shadyî and ìvery fishy.îMalkin lauded President Donald Trumpís exposure of assorted news media outlets ideological and partisan biases.ìWhat President Trump has been saying all along, and more effectively than any other politicianÖ more effectively than anyone else, [is] the sham that mainstream American media has become over the last 30 years,î remarked Malkin.Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

Joe Manchinís (D-WV) lead in the polls slipped to only four points over West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey ahead of a critical decision over whether the senator will decide to vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.A poll commissioned by the Senate Leadership Fund, a leading Senate Republican super PAC, showed that Sen. Manchin has 47 percent of the vote, while Morrisey has 43 percent, resulting in only a four-point gap between the incumbent Democrat and his Republican challenger.Five percent of voters remain undecided, with the margin of error for the poll at 4.1 points, making the West Virginia Senate race within Morriseyís grasp to win the Senate election in November.The Senate Leadership Fund poll contrasts with another survey conducted by the Democrat firm Global Strategy Group which found that Manchin leads by double digits.The Republican poll, however, found that President Donald Trump has a 58 percent approval rating in West Virginia. The survey also suggested that 19 percent of Trump voters back Manchin, although most of these voters said that they would be less likely to support Manchin if he opposes Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.Several polls released over the last couple of weeks found that a majority of West Virginians want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court. A survey from the Judicial Crisis Network (JNC)†found†that 58 percent of West Virginians want Kavanaugh confirmed, compared to only 28 percent who do not want him to join the nationís highest court.Another poll from the West Virginia†Metro News†found that 58 percent of West Virginians also want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court.Sen. Manchin represents a deep-red state that went for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election by 42 points, and he faces intense pressure to back Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.Politico†reported†on Thursday that Sen. Manchin continues to remain on the fence; however, the outlet suggested that he is likely leaning towards ìYes.îThe outlet did suggest ñ despite reports that Manchin is leaning yes ñ that he does not want to be the deciding vote to confirm Kavanaugh; however, he would be willing the becoming the ì51st or 52ndî vote to confirm.Attorney General Morrisey told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement on Thursday that Manchin is ìgutlessî for failing to provide leadership on such a crucial confirmation vote as this Kavanaughís vote.ìManchin is gutless and incapable of being the deciding vote for anything that President Trump is seeking to accomplish,î Morrisey said. ìOnly when Schumer and his liberal donors give him permission and the votes are already there,will Manchin vote the right way.î

Donnelly revealed in September that he will oppose Kavanaughís nomination to the Supreme Court because he believes that the FBI should investigate Christine Blasey Fordís accusation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school in the 1980s.One National Journal reporter found that Sen.

A Fox News survey found that Donnelly leads Braun by only two points, well within the pollís margin of error.A Fox News survey found that if Donnelly votes against Kavanaughís nomination, 32 percent of voters said it will make it less likely for them to vote for Donnelly, whereas 30 percent of voters said it would make it more likely they will vote for the incumbent Democrat. The poll also revealed that Braun and Donnellyís supporters have both suggested, at 39 percent each, that they are ìextremely interestedî in the Indiana Senate race, closing the previous Democrat lead in voting enthusiasm.ìThe media circus Democrats like Donnelly and Kamala Harris have created to smear Judge Kavanaugh is a disgrace, and Hoosiers should be appalled that Donnelly is cashing in on it to advance his political career,î said Kelley.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/exclusive-patrick-morrisey-gutless-joe-manchin-will-vote-for-kavanaugh-because-his-survival-depends-on-it/,"West Virginia Attorney General (AG) Patrick Morrisey told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement on Thursday that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) will make the ìcraven political calculationî to ultimately vote for Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh because his ìsurvival depends on it.îPolitico reported on Thursday that Sen. Manchin continues to remain on the fence as to supporting President Donald Trumpís nominee; however, the outlet suggested that he is likely leaning towards ìYes.îìItís clear Manchin doesnít want to be the 50th vote for Kavanaugh, but it seems like heíd be OK with being the 51st or 52nd, barring any new developments,î Politico wrote.The West Virginia Democrat also reportedly discussed Kavanaughís confirmation with the president.AG Morrisey told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement on Thursday that Manchin has given cover for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Democratsí ìshameful obstruct and resist circusî of the Supreme Court nomination process. Morrisey also said that† Manchin knows that his continued service in the U.S. Senate depends on his vote to confirm Kavanaugh for the nationís highest court.The West Virginia Republican said that Manchin is ìgutlessî because he cannot be the deciding vote for the presidentís nominee, but will only vote for Kavanaugh once he has political cover to become the 51st vote.ìManchin is gutless, and incapable of being the deciding vote for anything that President Trump is seeking to accomplish,î Morrisey said. ìOnly when Schumer and his liberal donors give him permission and the votes are already there will Manchin vote the right way.îMorrisey added, ìJoe Manchin has given cover to Senate Democrats for their shameful obstruct and resist circus of President Trumpís Supreme Court pick. West Virginians know that Joe Manchin is complicit in the Senate Democratsí and liberal mediaís disgraceful smear campaign of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.îThe West Virginia Republican charged that Manchin remains complicit in Schumerís plan to disrupt the Supreme Court nomination process.Schumer, immediately after Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, announced that he will oppose Kavanaugh ìwith everything I haveî because the ìstakes are simply too high.îImmediately after Manchin left his meeting with Kavanaugh, the West Virginia Democrat†went†straight to Schumerís office.Schumer suggested in July that vulnerable Senate Democrats should hold off on their decision whether to support Kavanaugh as long as possible.Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL)†said, ìAll Chuck ever says in caucus [meetings], itís pretty well known: ëKeep your powder dry. Donít commit. Stay as neutral as you can, as long as you can.îSeveral polls released over the last couple of weeks found that a majority of West Virginians want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court. A survey from the Judicial Crisis Network (JNC) found that 58 percent of West Virginians want Kavanaugh confirmed, compared to only 28 percent who do not want him to join the nationís highest court.Carrie Severino, the JCN chief counsel and policy director, said in a press release on Tuesday, ìSenators Heitkamp and Manchin need to decide whether they stand with Judge Kavanaugh and President Trump, or with the†outrageous smear campaign unleashed by Chuck Schumer and the liberal mob.îAnother poll from the West Virginia Metro News found that 58 percent of West Virginians also want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court.New poll shows West Virginians support Kavanaugh confirmation by a 30-point margin, 58-28.  cc: @JoeManchinWV #WVSen #SCOTUS https://t.co/kB20SpDOJyó Senate Leadership Fund (@Senate_Fund) September 28, 2018Morrisey told Breitbart News that he believes that Manchin will vote for Kavanaugh for political survival.Morrisey said, ìJoe Manchin will vote for Kavanaugh because he knows his political survival depends on it. Joe Manchin is out of touch with West Virginia values, but he isnít stupid. He will make a craven political calculation to vote for Kavanaugh, but only once the outcome has been determined. It is simply cowardice.îIn comparison to Manchin, Morrisey contended that he can and has led to carry out President Donald Trumpís agenda. In a previous interview with Breitbart News, Morrisey said that he worked with the White House to combat sanctuary cities.ìWe already worked with him [the president] on sanctuary cities, we have worked with him on illegal amnesty, and weíre working with the president to deregulate the economy,î Morrisey†told†Breitbart News during a rally in Huntington, West Virginia, in May.Morrisey concluded, ìWest Virginia deserves a Senator who will lead, not a liberal like Manchin who shows up after the fight is won. President Trump knows he can count on me to fight alongside him for the men and women of West Virginia. In a month from now, West Virginia will send a message to the nation that weíre tired of Joe Manchinís record of being another dishonest Washington liberal.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/relative-says-christine-blasey-ford-threw-witness-leland-keyser-under-bus/,"Leland Keyserís relative has accused Christine Blasey Ford of throwing her ìwitnessî and lifelong friendñKeyserñìunder the bus.î This family member also sounds skeptical of Fordís allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Ford, the woman whose accusations of sexual conduct have crumbled under scrutiny, claimed that Keyser, a lifelong friend since high school, would validate her allegation.Instead, Keyser said in a statement that she not only does not remember the house party where the 1982 incident allegedly took place, but she also has never even met Kavanaugh.Although Fordís story has countless discrepancies already, the fact that all three of her witnesses come down on the side of Kavanaughñincluding her lifelong friend, Keyserñhas blown the biggest hole in Fordís shaky credibility. (They either do not remember the gathering or refute it completely.)During her testimony last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Ford was asked about Keyser, and according to the Daily Mail, Keyserís family is furious about what happened next.What Ford told the committee about Keyser struck many as an attempt by Ford to attack her friend with the claim that Keyser would remember the incident if her health were not so bad, or that her health struggles forced her to lie because she does not have the strength to tell the truth. Here is what Ford said:Leland has significant health challenges, and Iím happy that sheís focusing on herself and getting the health treatment that she needs, and she let me know that she needed her lawyer to take care of this for her, and she texted me right afterward with an apology and good wishes, and et cetera. So Iím glad that sheís taking care of herself.I donít expect that P.J. and Leland would remember this evening. It was a very unremarkable party. It was not one of their more notorious parties because nothing remarkable happened to them that evening. They were downstairs.According to this unnamed family member who spoke to the Daily Mail, Keyser is dealing with significant health issues, and Fordís tossing her into this maelstrom without any notice did not help.ìLeland was completely blindsided by her name being thrown into it all. The first thing she knew about it was when she woke up on Thursday morning and her name was just everywhere. It was crazy,î the relative said.Keyserís loved one also sounded skeptical of Fordís allegations against Kavanaugh. ìI think itís quite convenient that [Ford] named the person who is frankly probably the least physically capable of all of them to stand up and be subjected to questioning or give her account.îìIt really felt a lot like Christine was the one called to the principalís office to give an account of something and just threw her under the bus,î this person said, adding, ìYou know, just reached for a name.îThe Daily Mail reports:[This] relative revealed the mother-of-twoís shock at being named as a witness by a woman to whom she has barely spoken in recent years.ÖAnd they expressed anger at Fordís suggestion that Keyser could not recall the party because of the ìsignificant health challengesî she has faced in recent years.ìThe family member went on to explain that the ëhealth challengesí faced by Keyser have not impaired her memory.îThe loved one also said that ìbeing caught up in the Kavanaugh scandal has proved physically trying at a time when Keyser is not in good health.îìSheís just trying to get through it and hoping for it all to die down.îOn at least two occasions, Keyser has denied any knowledge of this 1982 house party or having ever met Kavanaugh ó and she has done so under penalty of a felony.Ford named three witnesses. Including Keyser, all three have either said they do not remember the party or that it never happened.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/10/04/graham-fbi-background-check-was-done-professionally-without-interference/,"On†Thursday†while speaking to reporters, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said he was confident the extended FBI background check of†Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh was done professionally and without interference.Graham said, ìItís a complete report. Itís a background check. Iím confident the FBI did a good job. They were not hindered in any way. The focus was allegations before the committee. I was looking for certain things to be answered by witnesses. Iím more confident than ever that what the committee found has held up and then some. The main thing for me is that you need to go to the and need to ask them did they feel like they were able to do their job without interference, and I think the answer is yes. Over 150 people have been interviewed throughout the course of Brett Kavanaughís life. To those who suggest he had a problem like this from prior interviews, no evidence of that. Thatís all manufactured. The senators who requested the supplemental FBI background check got what they requested, and I am ready to vote.îHe added, ìYou need to talk to them. Iím confident that the supplemental FBI background check was done professionally, was done without interference, and it validated, in my view, where we are. But you need to talk to them. The idea the FBI looking at the committeeís work product made some sense. I didnít need it, but itís done, and it puts a stamp on it thatís different than it was before.îFollow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/david-perdue-republicans-need-grow-up-confront-paid-activists/,"Sen. David Perdue (D-GA) said on Wednesday that Republicans should not put up with the harassment and intimidation of left-wing protesters who have descended on Capitol Hill to protest President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, after Christine Blasey Ford accused him of sexually assaulting her decades ago at a high school party.ìThese are not genuine people who are concerned about Dr. Ford or anything else. These are paid activists,î Perdue said on The Laura Ingraham Show. ìThis is a George Soros conspiracy, and itís time we wake up, expose them, stand up, and fight for our country because thatís whatís at stake here.îìItís time for Republicans to stop being the minority party, grow up and stop playing defense,î Perdue said. ìThis is the time right now.îAnti-Kavanaugh protesters harassed Sen. Perdue and his wife at Reagan National Airport on Monday ó one in a series of confrontations between activists and lawmakers. The Senate Judiciary Committee delayed a vote on Kavanaughís confirmation to allow Ford to testify, then further delayed it to let the FBI conduct supplemental background checks on Kavanaugh and others named in her claims.One of Perdueís confronters at the airport was Arizona State Representative Isela Blanc, a Democrat. She and two other protesters are affiliated with The Center for Popular Democracy, funded by left-wing billionaire George Soros.The increasingly aggressive and angry protests have resulted in heightened security around Capitol Hill, including Capitol Police escorts for lawmakers on the Judiciary Committee.ìRepublicans had better not be asleep because these people are mobilized, theyíre funded, and, quite frankly, this is just the tip of the spear of all of their malign activity,î Perdue said.Perdue cited Democrats encouraging intimidation against political opponents in recent months, including Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) telling Kavanaugh opponents to ìget up in the face of some Congresspeopleî and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) telling her constituents to confront Trump administration officials at restaurants, gas stations, and department stores and to ìpush back on them.îPerdue also slammed Democrats for continuing their intimidation agenda during Kavanaughís 30-plus hours of confirmation hearings.ìIím disgusted with the process this week,î Perdue said. ìThis level of character assassination, I didnít think weíd see again in my lifetime.îAnd Perdue warned that the Democratsí tactics would not change going forward.ìThis is part of a bigger attempt by the Democrats to take this to a new level,î Perdue said. ìThis is a bigger issue, and itís not going to go away when we confirm Kavanaugh this week.îFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.

These uncorroborated accusations have been unequivocally and repeatedly rejected by Judge Kavanaugh, and neither the Judiciary Committee nor the FBI could locate any third parties who can attest to any of the allegations. Thereís also no contemporaneous evidence.

[Emphasis added.]In contrast to the allegations laid against Kavanaugh, Grassley said that many of the nomineeís friend and colleagues can only attest to Kavanaughís good nature.ìHere is what we know: Judge Kavanaughís former clerks, colleagues, and friends from high school to the present acclaim his personal integrity and character. His neighbors and community members recognize his positive contributions to their schools and churches,î Grassley said. ìAnd his fellow members of the legal profession know him to be a thoughtful and respectful jurist. His juridical record shows that he is fair and rules impartially and without prejudice.îThe Senate Judiciary Chairman said that now the FBI investigation cleared the accusations against Kavanaugh despite the Senate Democratsí tactics to disrupt the nomination process, senators ìought to wipe away the muck from all the mudslinging and politics and look at this nomination with clear eyes.îìHeís served with distinction for twelve years on the nationís most important circuit court and dedicated himself to serving the American public,î the Iowa senator said. ìWe know that he will be an excellent justice because heís been an excellent judge.îThe FBI report was the last hurdle for reluctant Senate Republicans such as Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), who insisted on a week-long FBI investigation before they signal if they will support the presidentís nominee.Now senators can have the chance to read the FBI report and decide if they plan to vote to confirm the presidentís nominee.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) filed the motion to cloture late Wednesday night, which would allow the Senate to vote to confirm Kavanaugh on Saturday.Chairman Grassley concluded that the Senate needs to take action on Kavanaugh.ìItís time to vote.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/04/nolte-latest-ronan-farrow-report-further-discredits-deborah-ramirez-brett-kavanaugh-allegation/,"The latest reporting from the New Yorkerís Ronan Farrow only further undermines Deborah Ramirezís already-discredited allegation of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh.Ten days ago, Farrow and his co-author Jane Mayer pretty much debunked Ramirezís story as they reported on it. Ramirez claims that during a drunken 1983 dorm room party at Yale, Kavanaugh aggressively flashed his genitals in her face.The problems with her story are legion.To begin with, Ramirez admits she was quite drunk that night. She also told the New Yorker that for 35 years she could not remember who exposed himself to her, at least until 1) Kavanaugh was nominated for the Supreme Court, and 2) she sat down for six days with her lawyer (a Democrat politician) to refresh her memory.Ramirez, whom the New Yorker describes as an activist Democrat, admits she has ìsignificant gaps in her memories of the evening,î and that at the party she ìbecame inebriatedî and ìwas on the floor, foggy and slurring her words.îMoreover, just as we have seen in the now-debunked allegations coming from Christine Blasey Ford and Julie Swetnick, all the witnesses named by Ramirez to back up her account come down on the side of Kavanaugh.No one remembers the incident. Farrow spoke to five former classmates who should have been able to corroborate Ramirezís claim, and all five, including Ramirezís best friend at the time, say they do not remember it. More than one says they do not believe Brett Kavanaugh would have ever done such a thing.Ramirezís charge against Kavanaugh took an especially big hit when the†New York Times reported that Ramirez had been calling her former classmates and admitting to them she could not be certain if it was Kavanaugh who exposed himself to her.Although the Times spent a week trying to corroborate her story, it could not, and no story ever ran.That left one ridiculous piece of corroboration, a former classmate who remembered hearing about the incident secondhand. In other words, he did not see the incident himself, but someone else told him it happened and that Kavanaugh was the culprit.But now, thanks to additional reporting from Farrow, even that has been blown apart.In the previous New Yorker report, this secondhand source chose to remain anonymous. On Wednesday, he revealed himself to Farrow as James Hastings Nichols, a seminary professor at Princeton Theological Seminary.Nichols reiterated to Farrow that he is ìone-hundred percent certainî he was told by somebody else that Kavanaugh exposed himself to Ramirez, and that he was told this no more than two days after it happened.ìI can corroborate Debbieís account,î he told the New Yorker. ìI believe her, because it matches the same story I heard thirty-five years ago, although the two of us have never talked.îThe problem, though, is that Nichols is not a witness. He did not see it happen. Somebody else told him it happened.But that is the least of his problems, becauseÖThe person who supposedly told Nichols about the incident has no memory of the incident.To Farrowís everlasting shame, he buries his own bombshell, the only real news in his piece under three paragraphs and hundreds of words:[Nichols] said that he had not been able to get any response from that person, despite multiple attempts to do so.†The New Yorker†reached the classmate, but he said that he had no memory of the incident.To recap:Wednesdayís New Yorker piece is, unfortunately, a dreadful and blatant piece of left-wing activism. Farrow had been doing some stellar work in the field of #MeToo, but the only good thing you can say about his work on the Ramirez story is that he did not leave anything out.Although his reporting has completely debunked her allegation, both pieces have been written with the obvious goal of burying those inconvenient facts and derailing Kavanaughís confirmation; especially this latest piece, which is a plea for further delays through the expansion of an FBI investigation.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/03/senate-gop-takes-steps-prevent-brett-kavanaugh-report-leaks/,"The FBIís seventh background investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh is reportedly slated to be released to senatorsí eyes only on Thursday morning. On Wednesday, Republicans laid out a tightly choreographed process to keep it confidential.The report as made available to senators†consists of only one paper copy of the FBIís official interview notes and other documents from the six-day probe, according to NBC News. Only the 100 senators and ten specially selected Senate Judiciary Committee staff will be allowed to see the copy. Republicans and Democrats will take alternating one-hour viewing sessions with the one copy.Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), a Judiciary Committee member, has led some of the strongest†attacks†against Judge Kavanaugh during his confirmation process ó especially after the publication of the uncorroborated sexual misconduct allegations that gave rise to this seventh FBI probe. He expressed his displeasure at the process to the Hill.ìGet this ó one copy! For the United States Senate,î Durbin told the Hill. ìThatís what we were told. And we were also told that we would be given one hour for the Dems, one hour for the Republicans. Alternating.îìWe tried to reserve some time to read it. That is ridiculous,î Durbin continued. ìOne copy?! Bizarre, it doesnít make any sense.îThe rules Republicans laid out no doubt stem from concerns that, in what may be the most politically charged and viciously fought judicial confirmation in modern American history, Democrats may selectively leak material to the news media that appears damning of Judge Kavanaugh or seems to corroborate accuser Christine Blasey Fordís account of a high school party where, she claims, a 17-year-old Kavanaugh groped her.This concern with security keeps with tradition and the explicit dictates of the governing memorandum of understanding on the subjectñthat FBI background investigations of nominees be kept confidential. Some in the news media, however, are skeptical even these precautions will prevent leaks:whispers: ìyes it willî https://t.co/If2BsTsQA6ó Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) October 3, 2018Regardless of any report leaks and what the document contains, a cloture vote to end debate on Kavanaughís nomination is now expected Friday, setting up a final Senate floor vote this weekend or Monday.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/10/03/wall-street-journal-on-brett-kavanaugh-were-all-deplorables-now/,"The†Wall Street Journal†has published a lead editorial Wednesday evening in which it argues the Democratsí effort to destroy Brett Kavanaugh has reminded anti-Trump conservatives that the left hates them even more than it hates the president.The†Journal further argues that the left has unified Republicans ó a seemingly impossible task, given internal divisions over Trump ó by reminding them that Democratsí hatred is not about Trump, but about the raw desire for power at any cost.As such, the†Journal editorial board ó which once derided the Tea Party as ìHobbitsî ó writes, ìWeíre All Deplorables Nowì:Judge Kavanaugh would have been on any Republicanís short list for the Supreme Court. ÖMr. Trumpís nomination of Mr. Kavanaugh is a credit to the process he established to win the election and govern with conservative support. He sought the help of legal elites on the right, led by the Federalist Society, who compiled an impressive list of potential nominees. This isnít a rogue judicial operation to choose presidential cronies. It is the gold standard for legal talent that believes in the original meaning of the Constitution. Itís hard to see how any GOP President would have done better, and others have done much worse.Yet this is precisely why Democrats and the left have set out to destroy Judge Kavanaughónot in legal philosophy or competence, which they knew was a political loser, but as a human being, a spouse and father. They need to destroy him personally with accusations but no corroboration, as they tried with Clarence Thomas, so they can deny the open Supreme Court seat to a judicial conservative.ÖRepublicans are well aware of Mr. Trumpís excesses and falsehoods. But they have also come to understand that the resistance to him isnít rooted in principle or some august call to superior character. They know Democrats nominated Hillary Clinton in 2016 despite her history of deceit. Voters know this is about the leftís will to power by any means necessary.Republicans across America can see, and certainly their Senators voting on Judge Kavanaugh should realize, that the left hates them as much or more than they loathe Mr. Trump. Conservatives understand that, for the American left, they are all deplorables now.Hillary Clinton infamously referred to Trump supporters as a ìbasket of deplorablesî during the 2016 election.Read the full editorial, which appears in Thursdayís print edition of the Wall Street Journal.Joel B.

Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Senate leadership allowed an extra week for additional investigation into Kavanaugh. President Trump ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation to expedite the Senateís request, and to conclude its work by this Friday. The FBI finished its work early, and consequently senators can review the supplemental report beginning Thursday morning.Under Senate rules, the motion must now ìripenî for a day. The full Senate will vote early on Friday on the motion. Although cloture requires 60 votes for legislation, only 51 votes are required for presidential nominees to judicial or executive office.If cloture is invoked Friday morning, the final vote on confirmation will come late on Saturday afternoon.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/03/nolte-28-reasons-julie-swetnicks-kavanugh-allegations-are-total-garbage/,"Using evidence, witness testimony, and their own testimony (either written or before the Senate Judiciary Committee), Breitbart News has already unraveled the first two allegations launched against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.And as of now, the accusations put forth by Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez have collapsed into a pile of lies, deceptions, and ó most importantly ó statements by the accusersí own witnesses ó all of whom back up Kavanaugh.This leaves only Julie Swetnick, the accuser represented by Michael Avenatti, the attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels made famous by far-left CNN.In a sworn statement dramatically released by her attorney last week, Swetnick made allegations against Kavanaugh that went above and beyond anything we have so far heard. According to Swetnick, Kavanaugh was part of an organized group of gang rapists who spiked punch bowls at high school parties before running sex trains on unsuspecting, incapacitated women.Whatís more, Swetnick alleges she herself was gang raped at one of these parties and that Kavanaugh was present when it happened.On top of this statement, Swetnick also sat down for an interview with the far-left NBC News.Even though NBC could not corroborate even one part of her story, this unethical news organization (with its own cancerous environment towards women), still ran with it.Maybe that was a good thing, because this interview only served to destroy whatever credibility Swetnick might have had left. And as a result, even those most desperate to destroy Kavanaugh have stopped talking about Swetnick ó and for good reason: she stands as toxic proof that a partisan campaign is indeed afoot to smear an innocent man, a wrongfully accused man.Here are 28 reasons why the Swetnickís allegations are horse shit, beginning with her sworn statement:1.†Swetnick claimed she attended ìwell over ten house partiesî in DC between the years 1981 and 1983 where Kavanaugh was present.This would mean that as an adult already in college, she was attending house parties with a Brett Kavanaugh who was as young as 15.2.†Although Swetnick presents herself as someone who was part of this party scene, as of now, no one who was part of Kavanaughís social circle at the time remembers her.3. At these parties, Swetnick claims Kavanaugh was regularly ìfondlingî and ìgrabbingî girls ìwithout their consent.îNone of these girls have come forward to allege anything of the kind.4. Moreover, how would Swetnick know the mind of these other girls, if they consented or not?5. Swetnick claims that at these parties Kavanaugh was ìverbally abusive towards girls by making crude sexual remarks.îSo far, some 60 men and women who knew Kavanaugh at the time have said (under penalty of felony) that he was only ever respectful towards them and others.Not a single witness backs this Swetnick claim. No one remembers Swetnick. No one even knows who she is.6. Swetnick claims she has been ìtold by other women that this conduct also occurred during the summer months Ö during Beach Week.îNo one has found these ìother womenî and it is awfully convenient that Swetnick was able to reference ìBeach Weekî just after Kavanaugh released his 1982 calendar where ìBeach Weekî is so prominently noted.7. Swetnick attacks Kavanaughís Fox News appearance with the false claim he wanted to appear ìinnocent.î She writes, ìThis claim is absolutely false and a lie.îThe truth, however, is that this is a straw man invented by the organized left to paint Kavanaugh as a liar. During the Fox News interview Kavanaugh admitted that at times he drank too much and did things he now finds embarrassing.8. Swetnick says that in 1981-82 she ìbecame awareî of Kavanaugh spiking the punch at these parties with ìdrugs and/or grain alcoholî in order to take sexual advantage of inebriated girls.ìBecame awareî is not the same as witnessing. How she ìbecame awareî is never explained.9. Swetnick says she did ìwitnessî something she calls ìeffortsî by Kavanaugh to get unsuspecting women ìinebriated and disoriented so they could be gang raped.îHere we have an adult woman attending more than ten high school ìgang rapeî parties organized by a 15 to 16-year-old Brett Kavanaugh, and she not only doesnít go to the police, she continues to attend them.In her NBC interview, though, she attempted to clear this up, but in doing so, only undercut her story all the more. She says people aged 15 to 25 attended these gang rape parties and that it was only in ìhindsightî that she figured out girls were being gang raped. Had she known at the time, she now says she would have ìburst into the roomî to save the victims and then gone to the police.10. Swetnick alleges she herself was gang raped and that Kavanaugh was ìpresent.îShe does not claim Kavanaugh participated in the gang rape, only that he was present, whatever that means.11. Swetnick claims she told two people at the time about the alleged gang rape.Those two people have not been found.Moving on to this weekís NBC interviewÖ12. NBC News listened to Swetnickís story and could ìnot independently verify her claimsî ó not a single one of them.13. NBC News admits, ìThere are things she told us on camera that differ from her written statement.î14. NBC News could not find anyone who ìremembers attending parties with Julie Swetnick and Brett Kavanaugh.î15. NBC News admits Swetnick is ìunclear about when she first decided to come forward.îThis target moves from when Swetnick first learned Kavanaugh was on President Trumpís short list of Supreme Court nominees to when Ford came forward ó a six-week window.16. Swetnick told NBC Kavanaugh attended these gang rape parties in his Georgetown Prep uniform.In other words, he was wearing his school uniform, not only at weekend or after school parties, but while organizing and executing gang rapes.17. When asked if she saw ìBrett Kavanaugh spiking the punch,î Swetnick said she saw Kavanaugh ìgiving red Solo cups to quite a few girls during that timeframe.îSo we have gone from spiking the punch for rape purposes, to handing out cups.18. Backing even further away from her sworn statement, Swetnick told NBC, ìI saw him around the Ö punch containers.î Then she says, ìI donít know what he did, but I saw him by them.îIn other words, the only evidence she has that Kavanaugh spiked the punch is that she ìsaw him byî the punch. AndÖShe ìdoesnít know what he did,î but is still accusing him of gang rape.19. In her statement Swetnick claims she saw Kavanaugh and other boys line up outside bedrooms waiting their turn to join in on the gang rapes.Swetnick told NBC that her evidence of this is that she saw ìboys standing outside of rooms, congregated together, sort of like a gauntlet.î She added, ìI would see them laughing, a lot of laughing.îWhen asked if they were even standing in a line, Swetnick explained, ìNot standing in line, but definitely huddled.î She adds that she saw Kavanaugh huddled with ìother boys.îThat is the only proof she has of gang rapes: boys at parties huddled together laughing and near a punch bowl.20. After describing her own alleged gang rape at one of these parties, she can only say that Kavanaugh was ìhanging aboutî the area where she ìstarted to feel disoriented.î21. She has no idea if Kavanaugh raped her or if he spiked her drink.22. Swetnick claims she told the Montgomery County Police about the alleged gang rape and named the officer she spoke with.That officer cannot verify anything because he is now deceased.23. Swetnick claims she told her mother about the rape the next day.Her mother cannot verify any of this because she is now deceased.24. Swetnick claims she might have told other people but cannot remember their names.25. Swetnick frequently names Mark Judge, Kavanaughís high school friend, as a co-conspirator.Under penalty of imprisonment, Judge called the allegations ìridiculousî and adds that he doesnít even know Swetnick.26. Swetnick said ìeverybody in the County remembers those [gang rape] parties.îNeither NBC nor anyone else can find a single person in the County who remembers those parties.27. Swetnick provided NBC with four names of friends who would verify these parties occurred.One friend said he does not know Swetnick. Another friend is deceased. The other two did not respond.28. NBC spent days looking into Swetnickís story and ìhas not been able to place her in that time period, at those house parties, in that group of friends.îForget the gang rape allegations, no one can even place Swetnick as someone who hung out in Kavanaughís social circle.While Swetnick cannot find anyone to corroborate any part of her story, even something as basic as her being part of Kavanaughís crowd, people who have come forward with the claim to know Swetnick have a lot to say about her.I am not adding any of this to the list because we do not yet know the full story, but a former boyfriend says he had to file a restraining order against Swetnick (NBC was able to verify this). A† former employer claimed in a 2000 lawsuit that Swetnick not only falsified her resume, she falsely accused two men of sexual misconduct as a means to cover up her own sexual misconduct.On Monday, a man who once ran for Congress as a Democrat, claimed Swetnickís father told him she had serious psychological problems.ìBelieve all women.î Somewhere Atticus Finch shudders. Take a good long look around at what life looks like with The Matriarchy in charge. We have now spent two weeks inside this toxic world, which means we now know it is a McCarthy-ite horror show, nothing less than warmed over Stalinism in a burnt bra.To paraphrase Sen.

Only Sen.

The opioid bill passed overwhelmingly through the House last Friday.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said on Wednesday that the legislation is ìset to deliver major relief to the American communities that have been decimated by the scourge of substance abuse and addiction.îMcConnell also said the that the opioid package represents ìa landmark package that will deliver critical resources to establish opioid-specific recovery centers and equip local medical practitioners.îSen.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/03/cnn-ids-fords-ex-runs-denial-in-first-mention-of-his-explosive-letter/,"CNN, in its first-ever mention of the sworn letter potentially discrediting Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford, identifies the redacted author by name and offers a denial of the letterís allegations from Fordís long-time friend.On Tuesday, Fox News first obtained a sworn statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee from a man who claimed to know Ford for roughly eight years in the 1990s, six of them as her romantic partner.CNN, like several other left-leaning news outlets, posted no reporting about the potentially narrative-shifting letter on Tuesday. The networkís very first mention of the letter came in a piece by†Geneva Sands and†Josh Campbell Wednesday afternoon leading with a Ford friend and allyís denial of the letterís contents. Further down, CNN identifies the ex-boyfriend, whose identity had been kept redacted by Judiciary Committee staff, by name and attacks his credibility.The letter, attested to under penalty of felony, calls into question key aspects of Fordís narrative, including her supposed fear of flying, claustrophobia, and need to have multiple exits to the homes in which she lives. The letter claims that, in six years of dating, Ford never suffered from any of these things, nor did she ever mention Brett Kavanaugh or having been sexually assaulted.Potentially the most consequential assertion contained in the ex-boyfriendís letter, however, was that Ford had coached a close friend, Monica McLean, on how to take polygraph tests for her government security clearance investigation, using her training in psychology. McLean eventually became an FBI agent, and is now retired from that position.The Republican majorityís Senate Judiciary Committee outside counsel during Fordís testimony, Arizona sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell, asked Ford a series of strikingly specific questions about her history with polygraphs, including whether she had ever ìgiven tips or advice to somebody looking to take a polygraph test.î Ford responded with a denial for each of these questions.If the allegations in the letter are true, Ford may have perjured herself during the hearing set up on her behalf to let her air allegations that a 17-year-old Kavanaugh had forced himself on her and groped her over her clothes at a high school party somewhere around the summer of 1982.McLean, the ex-FBI agent Ford is alleged to have coached for her polygraph, ìis furious that her reputation is now being called into question by a ëlieí that has thrust her into the national spotlight,î according to†CNN.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/03/republicans-outraged-by-brett-kavanaugh-circus-now-match-democrats-in-voter-enthusiasm/,"A new poll indicates that Republicans have closed the Democratsí formerly wide gap in voter enthusiasm, thanks to the ongoing crisis surrounding the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.A†new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll†released Wednesday found that 80% of Republicans now say the November elections are ìvery important,î compared with 82% of Democrats ó a statistical tie, well within the pollës 4-point margin of error.The poll was conducted on October 1st (Monday), as the FBI was conducting its supplemental probe of allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh. The 12-year veteran of the D.C. Circuit was recently accused of groping a girl when he was in high school ó a claim he denies. Republican Senators have called Democratsí attempt to derail Kavanaughís confirmation a ìcircusî ó a point on which both the GOP establishment and the conservative base seem to have found elusive agreementIn July, only 68% of Republicans said the midterm elections were ìvery important,î compared to 78% of Democrats.In addition, NPR notes: ìDemocratsí advantage on which party Americans want to control Congress has also been cut in half since last month. Democrats still retain a 6-point edge on that question, but it was 12 points after a Marist poll conducted in mid-September.îIt adds: ì[W]ith Democrats already up fired up for this election, the Kavanaugh confirmation fight has apparently had the effect of rousing a dormant GOP base.The poll results confirm anecdotal evidence from many districts. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said Sunday that the Kavanaugh controversy had helped the party dramatically. Fundraising for Republicans has also reportedly skyrocketed.While Democrats also believe the controversy will be helpful to their party in November, chiefly by motivating female voters who opposed Trump, those voters may have already been very interested in participating in the elections.Joel B.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/03/ann-coulter-whatever-it-takes/,"The Democratsí current position on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh is: We cannot have someone addicted to beer on our highest court! What if a foreign power were to ply him with this nectar in a can? Talk about taking control of our government! Suppose they throw in a case of Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier?A bitter college roommate is going whole hog, wailing, He lied about being a beeraholic.By the mediaís account, Kavanaugh was a bounder, a brawler and a drunk. And yet he still managed to graduate at the top of his class, go to Yale, then to Yale Law and work in the highest positions in government.I am in awe of his manliness. Hemingway has nothing on this guy! He should be our president. To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln after being told Ulysses S. Grant was a drunk, letís find out what Kavanaugh drank and send a barrel of it to every college student.At least the Democrats seem to have moved on from the Crazy Ladies Who Must Be Believed.Kavanaughís first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, doesnít remember the time or place of the alleged high school groping, and all four witnesses she named deny any memory of such a party.Forcing our first one-week delay, we were told that the poor lady was so traumatized by being groped in high school that she couldnít fly. It was the worst thing that ever happened to her, compelling her to do what any reasonable person would under the circumstances: Add a second front door to her house.She was supposedly terrified of small spaces, and an airplane, one of her friends told CNN, ìwas the ultimate closed space where you cannot get away.îThen we found out that Ford regularly jets off to Hawaii, Costa Rica, the South Pacific islands and French Polynesia Ö to go surfing, one of the most terrifying activities around.It sounded like a joke. I was so shattered and broken, I could only go rock climbing in the Grand Tetons. After that, Iíd repair to my room and curl up in a fetal position. Then Iíd go rock climbing again.An ex-boyfriend has come forward to say that in six years of dating Ford, she never mentioned a sexual assault, had no fear of flying, lived comfortably in a tiny home with only one front door, once coached a friend on how to take a polygraph, contrary to her sworn testimony ó and also lied about stealing $600 from him.Kavanaughís second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, jumped in to help, dusting off a memory of the nominee pulling a Bill Clinton on her as a freshman in college ó but only after she spent a week huddled with her attorney, ìassessing her memoriesî and calling classmates to ask if they thought it was true.And did she have corroboration? She doesnít need any! Sheís a ìsurvivor.î Even The New York Times ó the newspaper that believed the Duke lacrosse rape case until about five minutes before the prosecutor was disbarred ó said Ramirez didnít have enough evidence to meet its standards.His third accuser, our heroine Julie Swetnik, is the woman produced by porn lawyer Michael Avenatti. She claims that she repeatedly attended gang rape parties in the 1980s ó and she saw Brett Kavanaugh there!An ex-boyfriend says Swetnik once threatened to kill him and his unborn child; she had a restraining order taken out against her; was sued by an employer for engaging in ìsexually offensive conduct,î making ìfalse and retaliatory allegationsî against co-workers and also lying about her educational background and work history.A Democrat and Emmy-winning meteorologist wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee stating that, soon after he met Swetnik in the 1990s, she proposed group sex to him. Some years later, her own father told him to stay away, citing Swetnikís psychological problems.She is now the Democratsí leading contender for 2020.Poor Kate Snow of NBC News thought she had landed the interview of a lifetime when she sat down with Swetnik. Within about three questions, it became clear that she was talking to a lunatic. At that point, most of Snowís energy went into hoping for a building-wide power failure to shut down the cameras.Of the four witnesses Swetnik provided to NBC, whom she claimed would confirm her story, one denied knowing any Julie Swetnik, one was dead, and two did not respond to the network, perhaps wishing they were dead too.By the end of the interview, Snowís purse was missing.But the Democrats are energetic devils. Theyíve been poring over Kavanaughís high school yearbook and exclaiming, Heís a beeraholic!With grim passion, they say, how dare you laugh at this? If he were a teetotaler, theyíd say, We canít have someone on the court whoís so nerdy. How can this weird aesthete sympathize with murderers and insider traders?Theyíve already won a second weekís delay by having two deranged women scream at Sen. Jeff Flake in an elevator.After wetting himself, Flake insisted on a seventh FBI investigation. For weeks, the Democrats have been demanding an investigation ó of an incident without witnesses, on a date unknown at a place unknown ó by saying, Oh, you big babies, the FBI investigation of Anita Hill only took three days!The FBI wrapped up its investigation of Kavanaugh in a few days and then sat around wondering how long it had to wait before producing the report. So now the ìit will only take three daysî crowd is saying, Keep investigating! We donít know how long the probe should be, but the minimum standards of decency require that it last at least until thereís a new president.Whatever they find, they will argue in the alternative and just keep doing it and doing it. If Kavanaugh stepped on a bug, PETA activists would be screaming at Flake in an elevator.The Democrats have a pair of twos, but they expect Republicans to fold. Why? Because thatís what Republicans always do!Unfortunately, this time, Kavanaughís supporters are not accepting surrender.COPYRIGHT 2018 ANN COULTER

In fact sometimes with several at one time. She wanted to know if that would be ok in our relationship.
Ö
I asked her if this was just a fantasy of hers. She responded that she first tried sex with multiple guys while in high school and still liked it from time-to-time. She brought it up because she wanted to know if I would be interested in that.Coulter said, ìApparently someone else stepped forward, in addition to the boyfriend [Swetnick] threatened to kill his unborn child, in addition to the company she worked where she was sued for both sexual harassment and making false claims of sexual assault.îMansour explained, ìThis guy actually was a Washington, DC, meteorologist who won an Emmy. So it wasnít just anybody. His name was Dennis Ketterer. He was a Democrat who ran for Congress, too, so this isnít some right-winger.îìWhen heís running for Congress, heís thinking, ëWell, okay. I didnít want to have threesomes with another guy with this girl, but maybe sheíd like to volunteer on my campaign,íî Coulter explained, noting that Ketterer ended up speaking with Swetnickís father who told him that his daughter had psychological problems.ì[Ketterer] apparently was like 350 pounds, and when [Swetnick] approached him and hit on him in a bar, he was like, ëWhy is she hitting on me? This isnít the sort of woman who would hit on me,'î Mansour explained. ìHe says point blank, ëMy impression was that she was an opportunist, and that she was going after me because Iím on TV.'îCoulter quipped, ìHer opening gambit was, ëWould you have a threesome with me and another guy?í This is why the Julie Swetnick 24-hours-a-day station is going to be a huge hit, and I am insisting on it.îMansour joked, ìIt could be pay-per-view.îìI want her to testify for 12 hours,î Coulter added. ìIf they canít find anyone, Iíll be refilling her water glass, Iíll bring her all the caffeine she needs. I do not want this woman to stop talking.îìI donít have the 24-hour TV station, yet, but I insist that Breitbart radio turn itself over from now until election day,î Coulter continued.ìI do not want the Democrats to be able to separate themselves from Julie Swetnick. This is the party of Julie Swetnick. Weíll go with Brett Kavanaugh. Youíve thrown everything you have at him. We think he may have stepped on a bug once, and PETA is going to come after him. But you guys are the party of Julie Swetnick,î Coulter said.ìThis is no longer the party of FDR, Kennedy, and Truman. This is the party of Julie Swetnick,î Coulter emphasized. ìIíll take that going into the midterms. I canít get enough of this lady.îìWhat is it, now, where you can basically just scream, ëI was raped!í and weíre all supposed to suspend due process and the presumption of innocence? What the hell is going on here? If Julie Swetnick isnít proof enough that women lie, what else is?î Mansour asked.ìDo not knock Julie Swetnick. My heroine, Julie Swetnick,î Coulter joked.ìDid you see that interview with Kate Snow?î Coulter asked. ìOf course you did, because theyíve been replaying it all day on MSNBC, which is totally weird. Iíve never had my interests aligned with the interests of MSNBC, so I donít know what theyíre thinking over there. But the look in that poor Kate Snowís eyes as sheís interviewing this obvious grifter, going into the interview thinking, ëWhoa, this is going to be gold,í and then five questions in, Kate Snow is just praying, ëPlease let the power go out in this building. Please let this entire thing be shut down.í And poor MSNBC is just humiliating her by running it over and over and over again, and theyíre proud of it.îMansour noted that when Snow asked Swetnick if she could provide any names of witnesses to back up her allegations that there were mass gang-rape parties taking place in Maryland in the 1980s, Swetnick offered four names, of whom, ìone person is dead, the other person has never heard of her, and the two others wonít answer the phone.îìIf you can get Michael Avenatti on the phone, I think there might still be some insane asylums where he might find some new clients,î joked Coulter.ìI love this guy,î said Mansour of Michael Avenatti. î I want him to run in 2020 because he would be so entertaining.îìMaybe an Avenatti-Swetnick ticket,î quipped Coulter.Coulter mocked ubiquitous news media descriptions of Christine Blasey Ford as ìcredible.îìEverybody was calling Ford credible,î said Mansour. ìThis is a woman who basically claimed that she had to travel across the country in a Conestoga wagon because she was afraid of flying, and then when sheís there testifying, sheís like, ëOh yeah, I fly all the time.'îìThat was a really big lie,î said Coulter of Fordís claimed fear of flying. ìThat was not only evidence of her trauma that she couldnít be alone in an enclosed space, but thatís why we had to wait for a week for her to show up? And it turns out the whole thing is nonsense. Sheís flying to Tahiti all the time, going surfing, an activity that most people consider frightening. Sheís not exactly curled up in a little ball, Miss Surfer Girl.îCoulter remarked, ìLetís compare [Christine Ford] with manifest lunatic Julie Swetnick, who has all the confidence of an insane person. Thatís what I expected Ford to be like, and I will admit she was not that.îCoulter mocked Democratsí belief that an FBI investigation will confer credence to uncorroborated allegations: ìApparently, the FBI is done [with their investigation], and theyíre just sitting around saying, ëOkay, how long do we have to hold this? How long do we have to pretend weíre still working here? When do you guys want it?'îCoulter went on, ìDemocrats donít want [the FBI report] made public, presumably so they can lie about whatís in it. Now, Iím trusting [Utah Senator] Orrin Hatch on this, but I think the whole idea of this was, we have to clear this guyís name, it has to be clear for the entire country, so in the abstract, I donít really see the point of keeping it secret. I do find it very curious that itís Democrats who want to keep it secret.îìThis is the first time [Democrats] donít want to leak something,î Mansour replied.ìTheyíll leak the parts they like,î Coulter replied. ìWe know theyíre going to selectively leak. Iím kind of thinking the whole report should be released.îìI think they should just go ahead and confirm Kavanaugh, and then spend any time they can save from the Russia investigation ó because you know thatís so important ó I just want to know all about Julie Swetnick,î Coulter joked.Breitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/10/03/alyssa-milano-im-filled-with-rage-trump-gop-institutionalizing-sexual-abuse/,"Tuesday on MSNBCís ìLive,î actress Alyssa Milano said she was ìfilled with rageî because when people like President Donald Trump and Supreme Court associate justice Brett Kavanaugh are put in positions of power, it means ìsexual abuse has been institutionalized in this country.îMilano said, ìIím filled with a lot of rage. It started last night. I couldnít sleep at all last night. I canít believe this is where we are. We are making distinct†choices†about what we want to be as a country. Weíre making distinct choices about the people weíre putting in positions of power, whether it be Trump or Kavanaugh or our institutions. Sexual abuse has been institutionalized in this country, and it is heartbreaking for me. I donít think we can allow another generation of women and children to feel as though their government isnít listening, that doesnít care, and they are invisible. Iím filled with rage, for Sarah to go on and say he was just stating the facts. The sky blue. I can state that fact. If I do it totally a little off, like the sky is blue, Iím mocking someone that may have said that. Tone is everything right now. We are making a choice. The Republican party is making a choice to back this man and this administration in this time, right now, right here and history will reflect upon this time as being devastating. I will tell you this; 34 days till the midterm election, there were 800,000 new voters on voter registration day. I think women, I think survivors, I think men are not going to allow this to continue. Weíre going to take back the House and maybe even the Senate.îShe continued, ìI will also add that 80% of victims of sexual assault do not report at all. Weíre talking about a very minuscule point of women that are falsely reporting. Also, men are having a hard time right now. I mean, come on. I feel as though heís completely belittling the intelligence of the American people.îShe added, ìDo they agree with him or is he using some sort of cult-like force to try to make them see that? Iím not sure if you were to have a real conversation with any American whether they be Democrat or Republican, that they would side with this kind of behavior where weíve reached a low weíre mocking people and their stories of hurt and of pain. Who are we? Who do we want to be as a country? What are we trying to project to the young people of this world, to the young people of this country? Itís heartbreaking to me. I think yes, weíre in a time thatís very gray. This is the #MeToo generation. What is happening right now is weíre defining boundaries. Boundaries that have never been defined before. As Trump might say that white men have it very difficult right now, Iím saying that women, young people, have had it difficult for generations and generations and generations. We will not be silenced any longer. If that means that men have a hard time right now, then Iím sorry, this is the way the pendulum has to shift for us to have the equality and security in our country and our societal views of what it means to be a woman. We are considered less than. We cannot stand for it anymore.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/03/nolte-new-evidence-eliminates-christine-blasey-fords-residual-credibility/,"Breitbart News has already gone into great detail to lay out the facts that unravel the allegations†Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez†made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Since these individual reports, Fordís story has continued to crumble.Real Clear Politics has looked at the records surrounding Fordís claim that an extensive 2012 remodel of her home involving two front doors triggered her memory of Kavanaughís alleged 1982 assault attempt.Documents, however, show that the remodel took place in 2008 and that the second front door was not an odd request from a traumatized woman fearing she could not escape, but someone looking to make extra income renting out part of her home ó possibly in violation of local zoning laws.A sworn statement released by a man alleging to be Fordís former boyfriend appears to have answered one very important question. During her testimony last week, why did sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell ask Ford if she had ever helped someone prepare for a polygraph? It was such an out-of-nowhere question, a seeming waste of time.Ford answered that she had ìneverî helped anyone prepare for a polygraph.Well, now we likely know why. The Senate Judiciary Committee might have known about this former boyfriend, and that under penalty of imprisonment, he would tell them Ford once used her skills in psychology to help a friend prepare for a polygraph.If this is true, Ford could be guilty of perjury.The boyfriend also alleges that nearly a year after they broke up, Ford used one of his credit cards to charge $600 and then lied about it. It was only after he threatened to get fraud investigators involved that she admitted to it.As far as the already-debunked claim about Ford being afraid to fly ó a claim that delayed the Kavanaugh confirmation a full week ó he writes, ì[W]e traveled around the Hawaiian islands including one time on a propeller plane. Dr. Ford never indicated a fear of flying.îDuring the ten years he knew her and the six years they were a couple, she never mentioned any kind of sexual assault, a Brett Kavanaugh, or a fear of closed spaces. In California, he writes, ìshe ended up living in a very small, 500 sq. ft. house with one door.îFor this reason, Senate investigators are again demanding Fordís attorneys release all the information pertaining to her polygraph test and her therapist notes. In the court of public opinion and through our monstrous media, both have been used as evidence against Kavanaugh, but no one has investigated either.As of now, Fordís legal team is refusing to release anything.ADDED: The friend in question denied to the far-left CNN that Ford helped her prepare for a polygraph. But unlike Fordís former boyfriend, she made this claim to an anti-Trump cable channel and not while under oath.As of this writing, Fordís legal team is still refusing to release either her polygraph information or therapist notes to the Senate Judiciary Committee.In fact, as you can see below, Fordís team is using the request for this pertinent information to delay the proceedings further. Ford will only provide this information if the FBI agrees to ìscheduleî an interview with her. Considering the games she played to delay her testimony for a full a week (the lies about being afraid to fly), heaven only knows how long ito would take to ìscheduleî that interview.There is no need for the FBI to speak with Ford, she has already testified in-depth, but they are now playing more games, as opposed to providing the evidence that is supposed to bolster her allegations:Fordís lawyers tell Grassley that they will provide her therapy notes, polygraph data to the FBI once she is interviewed (that hasnít happened as of now) pic.twitter.com/t1N6jhDPwEó Seung Min Kim (@seungminkim) October 3, 2018Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

It totals  millions each year from mine and your tax dollar to support a rapist.ó Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) September 29, 2018Broaddrick called out Senate Democrats for brushing off her claims in 1999 while paying extra attention to California psychology professor Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Deborah Ramirez, and Julie Swetnickóall of whom allege Kavanaugh sexually assaulted them more than 30 years ago.The statute of limitations on Fordís allegations from 1982 had also run out, given that assault and attempted rape at the time were misdemeanor offenses subject to a one-year statute of limitations.ìBack in 1999, Sen. Chuck Schumer, Sen. [Dianne] Feinstein, and Sen. [Dick] Durbin refused to read my investigation and record with the independent counselñcompletely refusedñeven [though] they were asked by the committee, and the committee said, ëThis woman has credible evidence,íî Broaddrick told Breitbart News.She also pointed out the hypocrisy of Democrats for focusing on the Kavanaugh allegations while not giving equal time to the sexual misconduct allegations against Rep.

The man contradicted parts of her under-oath testimony, particularly her claim that she has ìneverî advised anyone on how to take a polygraph test.

Swetnick, who is represented by Resistance TV lawyer Michael Avenatti, recently made headlines after accusing Brett Kavanaugh of being present at high school parties where there were gang rapes. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations, saying, ìI donít know who this is and this never happened.îDennis Ketterer claims that during his relationship with Swetnick, he had a conversation with her about how she liked group sex.A Utah man named Dennis Ketterer reached out to the Hatch office this week with information about accuser Julie Swetnick, and her allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.His full statement made under pentaly of felony to @senjudiciary can be found here ñ> https://t.co/0dSwAHlnVe pic.twitter.com/YSbuONkA5Wó Senator Hatch Office (@senorrinhatch) October 2, 2018The letter reads:During a conversation about our sexual preferences, things got derailed when Julie told me that she liked to have sex with more than one guy at a time. In fact sometimes with several at one time. She wanted to know if that would be ok in our relationship.I asked her if this was just a fantasy of hers. She responded that she first tried sex with multiple guys while in high school and still liked it from time-to-time. She brought it up because she wanted to know if I would be interested in that.A.I.D.S. was a huge issue at the time. And I had children. Due to her having a directly stated penchant for group sex, I decided not to see her anymore. It put my head back on straight. That was the last conversation we had.Julie never said anything about being sexually assaulted, raped, gang-raped or having sex against her will. She never mentioned Brett Kavanaugh in any capacity.†[emphases added]Ketterer then claims in his letter that Julie Swetnickís own father told him years later that she ìhad psychological and other problems.îHe also reveals that he was a victim of sexual abuse himself, writing, ìI know what itís like to be sexually assaulted and not be believed. I was nine years old when it happened at the hands of my grandfatherís best friend.îFinally, he ends the letter by simply stating, ìbased on my direct experience with Julie, I do not believe her allegations against Mr. Kavanaugh.îHis letter has already prompted a response from Resistance TV lawyer Michael Avenatti.ìThe letter from Dennis Ketterer is garbage ñ the GOP is desperate,î he tweeted. ìThe allegations he makes are false and without any basis.

Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) owes Brett Kavanaugh an apology for her role in the smear campaign against him.Referring to Thursdayís Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where the Supreme Court nominee apologized after he got caustic with Klobuchar, Graham told Sean Hannity Monday night that ìthis is the one that bothers me the most. [Kavanaugh] apologized to Amy Klobuchar for snapping at her. What would you do if you were accused of all these things, had your life ruined?îìHereís what I think,î Graham said, ìAmy Klobuchar should apologize to Kavanaugh and his family for being part of a smear campaign that I havenít seen in over 20 years in politics.îGraham also said the ìKavanaugh bump is real,î that his view of the polling shows the ongoing smear campaign against Kavanaugh has energized Republicans like never before.ìEvery race in these Trump/red states held by a Democrat [senator] ó thereís been a surge by Republicans,î Graham said.Referring to Democrats, he added, ìYouíve been able to do something, my friends on the other side, I could never do: unite this party.îìWhether youíre a Trump Republican, Ö McCain Republican, Romney Republican, Bush Republican, youíre mad as hell because weíre all united that this is unfair, [and] what theyíre doing to this good, decent man cannot stand.îGraham then sent a message to the holdouts in the GOP, those three senators ó Flake, Murkowski, and Collins ó who have still not said they will vote to confirm Kavanaugh. ìTo do it, you had to destroy a good man, and the only way he stays destroyed?

What weíve seen is what a military mind, eye, would call quibbling over notes in a yearbook or what did or did not happen at a party.

In that time, he claims to have witnessed Ford, then studying psychology, coach a close friend as she prepared for government administered polygraph exams. Fox Newsís Shannon Bream posted a redacted version of the letter on Twitter:BREAKING:  Foxís @johnrobertsFox obtains letter from Ford ex-boyfriend alleging:  dated for 6 yrs, never told of sex assault, Ford coached friend on taking polygraph, flew frequently w/o expressing any fear of flying/tight spaces/limited exits.

Fordís claims that phobias of these things have plagued her since the early 1980s as a result of a 17-year-old Kavanaugh attacking her have been central elements of her story.Further, the man claims Ford never mentioned being a victim of sexual assault in the eight years they knew each other and never once mentioned Kavanaughís name. Finally, he claims their relationship ended amid infidelity and credit card fraud on her part.†He does, however, claim that he ìfinds†Ford believableî and did not ìwant to become involvedî with the investigatory process.Exactly when the Senate Judiciary Committee staff came into possession of the letter is not clear. Mitchellís specific questioning about polygraph prepration during Fordís committee testimony, however, may indicate committee staff had some knowledge of the allegations laid out in the letter at least as early as last week.This is a developing story.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/10/02/nolte-after-enabling-franken-covering-up-weinstein-bombshells-nbc-mocks-kavanaugh-via-snl/,"Over the weekend, Saturday Night Live gleefully piled on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and did so less than a year after this very same SNL came out in full-throated support for credibly accused serial groper Al Franken.Letís back up a bitÖThe reason Democrats and their establishment media allies are now launching conspiracy theories about Kavanaugh ìlyingî about his teenage drinking is that the sexual misconduct allegations against him have collapsed. Simply put, by any objective measure, Kavanaugh has been wrongly accused, smeared, a victim of sexual McCarthysim. In my four decades of watching politics, never before have I witnessed a moral obscenity such as this.The opposite, however, is true of disgraced former Sen. Al Franken (D-MN).Franken is not only credibly accused, we have photographic evidence of him ó not as a teenager, but as a 55-year-old man ó groping a sleeping womanís breasts.Whatís more, and this is important, almost all of Frankenís other half-dozen or so accusers are Democrats, leftists, and even supporters of his.One alleged victim (number eight) says Franken groped her at a Media Matters gala celebrating Barack Obamaís 2009 presidential inauguration.Another claims Franken groped her while she posed for a photo with him at a left-wing event in 2007.Yet another says the soon-to-be senator grabbed her butt that same year at a Democrat fundraiser.Stephanie Kemplin, an army veteran, says Franken grabbed her breast while she was having her photo taken with him in 2003.Lindsay Menz wanted a photo with Franken† in 2010 and says he abused the occasion to ìput his hand full-fledged on my rear.îA former Democrat congressional aide accused Franken of attempting to kiss her without consent because, as she claims he put it, †ìItís my right as an entertainer.îSo, we not only have a PHOTOGRAPH of Franken groping a woman, we have some half-dozen Democrat women coming forward to accuse Franken. By any measure, this is as credible as sexual misconduct allegations get, and yetÖ†And yetÖAND YETÖSaturday Night Live ran to Al Frankenís rescue. Even though the groping photograph had already been released, even though multiple women had already come forward to allege the same, 36 former SNL staffers signed a letter in support of Senator Handsy. Thirty six! All of them women.But this very same SNL, the SNL that wrist-flicked photographic evidence and multiple allegations against Franken, was eager to pile on the wrongfully accused Kavanaugh; and if that is not rich enough for you, the man playing Kavanaugh was Matt Damon ó who is also a Franken apologist, who also dismissed his serial misconduct as a ìterrible joke.îOh, and letís not forget who the Big Star of this very same SNL is ó you know, Mr. Alec Baldwin, the raging homophobe whose history of mistreating women (including his own daughter) reaches back decades.But now we get to my favorite part of all this, and that would be Rapey NBC ó the network that broadcasts the garbage fire of grope-enabling that is SNL.Yes, NBC, that den of sexual misconduct, that hive of misconduct-enablers that has chewed up and spit out countless female victims.Yes, Rapey NBC, the former home of Matt Lauer, of Dan Swinzen, of Larry Gaetano, of Harold Ford Jr., of Mark Halperin, of Matt Zimmerman, of David CornÖ all now gone from view because the allegations against them were just that credible.But it took the #MeToo movement to get them out.And after they were finally out, how many cries of ìEverybody knew!î did we hear?Too damn many.Somehow it gets worseÖStill employed at NBC is Chris Matthews, an accused sexual harasser who reportedly settled a lawsuit.Somehow it gets worserÖNBC hired sports anchor Mike Tirico after he had been credibly accused of stalking, groping, and making explicit comments to female colleagues.And now we get to the worsterest (yes, thatís a word because it ìidentifiesî as such), and I am of course talking about the alleged cover up ó not only to protect the big shots at Rapey NBC, but to protect Harvey Weinstein.Letís start with the fact that Rapey NBC refused to hire outside investigators to look at its countless sex scandals, which is why we get headlines like, ìNBC News Investigated NBC News and Found No Culture of Harassment at NBC News.îYes, Rapey NBC investigated Rapey NBC and found nothing amiss, even though ìEveryone knew!îAnd letís never forget that the same Rapey NBC that just savaged an innocent man ó and not only on SNL, but with the news division publishing a uncorroborated, unverified, un-vetted allegation against Kavanaugh that was quickly recanted ó is the same NBC that had audio tape of Harvey Weinstein admitting to groping women and refused to run the story.On top of that, Rapey NBC had all kinds of corroborating witnesses alleging Weinstein was a sexual predator, and instead of running the story, Rapye NBC let Ronan Farrow, his game-changing story, and the eventual Pulitzer that went with it, walk right out the door.Not to worry, though, because Rapey NBC assures us this has nothing to do with the fact that the president of NBC News, Noah Oppenheim, is a wannabe screenwriter who had been spotted attending swanky events with Weinstein.And Iím sure it has absolutely nothing to do with Andrew Lack, the chairman of NBC News, and his reported history of looking the other way when it comes to sexual harassment under his watch.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/nomination-expert-hundreds-of-people-have-been-asked-about-kavanaugh-drinking-habits-by-fbi/,"Gregg Nunziata, former chief nominations counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on a conference call with reporters on Tuesday that ìhundredsî of people have been asked in six different FBI background checks whether they believe Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has an alcohol or substance abuse problem.ìIn these background investigations ó and now thereís been half a dozen of Kavanaugh over his life ó itís a standard question for every single witness they talk to: ëDo you have any knowledge of alcohol or substance abuse by the nominee?íî Nunziata said when Breitbart News asked how the agency vets individuals on this issue.ìWe can know without knowing whatís in that file ó we can know that hundreds of people who have known the judge over his career have been asked that specific question and that information would already be in the file,î said Nunziata on the call, hosted by the Judicial Crisis Network.Kavanaugh has served in several high-profile, high-level positions in the government, including as an assistant to former President George W. Bush and as a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for the last 12 years.Only after Kavanaughís 30-plus-hour confirmation hearings concluded did Christine Blasey Fordís claim that he sexually assaulted her at a high school party in the early 1980s become public.And when the committee held a hearing to allow Ford to tell her story and Kavanaugh to respond, Democrats repeatedly questioned the nominee about his drinking habits. That has continued with Democrats even calling for the FBI to investigate Kavanaughís drinking habits.But, according to Nunziata, it is a standard part of any FBI background check to determine if someone seeking a position in the federal government has an alcohol or substance abuse problem.After Ford and Kavanaugh testified last week, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), a Trump critic who is not running for reelection and is said to have presidential ambitions, called for a one-week supplemental FBI investigation to interview Kavanaugh and Ford further and others implicated in alleged incidents that happened decades ago.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has said that Kavanaughís nomination, which was moved out of committee, will be voted on this week.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/10/02/michael-steele-kavanaughs-aberrant-behavior-at-hearing-a-cultural-moment-gop-is-ignoring/,"Tuesday on MSNBCís ìDeadline,î former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said Republican politicians and President Donald Trump are ìignoringî Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaughís ìaberrantî behavior during his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.Steele said, ìLetís start with what the president said; at a base level, there is truth in the idea that we donít want to create an environment in which anyone can be accused of something falsely or wrongly to get back, payback, you know, for bad date or something like that, God forbid. But then the question becomes so then what is the resolution of that? How do you begin to solve that particular question? What are you contributing, Mr. President, to helping us as a nation deal with something that is so profoundly important in light of the nominee you have put forward and the issues that have been raised there? So the answer to that is, ëNothing. I have nothing to contribute other than to bloviate about how bad this is for white men.'îHe continued, ìHeís not the right messenger given the baggage that he brings to the table on this issue. Thereís still at least 18 to 20 unresolved accusations against the sitting president of the United States on this very issue. Of which we have him on tape giving us a sort of how-to in terms of what he does and how he approaches women in his relationships.îHost Nicolle Wallace said, ìGrab them in the bleep.îSteele continued, ìExactly. So you have that piece. The other piece, though, is how you put in motion and set up the conversation of Judge Kavanaugh. Itís not any longer about the allegations. Thatís going to be resolved by the FBI. Now we have to step back and look at how the man performed. How he responded as a judge under fire in a critical situation which was very clearly an aberrant response. I was sitting there with the jaw open, ëLike dude really?í Particularly when he went after Senator Klobuchar in a very personal way. That to me should bring a pause to everyone. You know, Nicolle, it wonít. Our team is prepared to die on the hill for this man and take with it every value that we have in that relationship with women.îOn actor Matt Damonís parody of Kavanaugh, Steele added, ìIf he does make it to the bench, that then becomes the caricature of his tenure on the bench. Youíre the no going to get past news articles. Youíre not going to get past video images comparing that ëSaturday Night Liveí sketch to, you know, the man in the moment. And I think thatís the problem about this that the president, the White House, and Republicans, particularly McConnell on the hill, just donít care about and are ignoring. That, yes, weíre going to push this through, weíre going to plow through this but going to bring with it a great taint. I think it is a cultural moment. It is a sliding door that now has moved the imagery of this man and turned it around so now the country looks at him, I think, very differently than they otherwise would as a justice coming to the court.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/flake-says-he-was-very-troubled-by-kavanaughs-testimony-wont-prejudge/,"Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake (R) criticized Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaughís testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, but said he is waiting to hear from the FBI before making a decision on whether to confirm him.ìI just hope that we find fact. I have an open mind, just like I had in the hearings, and weíll see what they come back with, I donít want to prejudge it,î he said at an event on Tuesday hosted by the left-leaning outlet The Atlantic.Flake†told the outlet over the weekend that he was planning to confirm Kavanaugh unless the FBI finds something.†ìYes. Iím a conservative. Heís a conservative. I plan to support him unless they turn up somethingóand they might,î he had said.The Senate is poised to vote on Kavanaughís confirmation, after the conclusion of a one-week investigation by the FBI on allegations of sexual misconduct made against the nominee.But Flake caused confusion Tuesday after he said Kavanaughís testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week was†ìsharp and partisanî and ìwe canít have that on the court.îìI was very troubled by the tone of the, of the remarks. The initial, uh, defense that Judge Kavanaugh gave was something like I told my wife, ëI hope that I would sound that indignant if I were, uh, if I felt that I was unjustly, you know, maligned,'î he said.ìBut then it went on, and the interaction with the members was sharp and partisan, and that concerns me, and I tell myself, ëGive a little leeway because of what heís been through.í But, on the other hand, we canít have this on the court. We simply canít,î he added.Flake appeared to disavow those comments moments after walking off stage, according to a reporter from The Atlantic, who said she asked him if his comments meant he would not vote to confirm Kavanaugh even if the FBI found nothing to corroborate sexual misconduct allegations made against him.ìI didnít say that Öî Flake†told the reporter. ìI wasnít referring to him.îSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) postponed a vote to confirm Kavanaugh to this week, after Flake supported advancing his nomination to the full Senate on the condition the FBI would be given one week to look into the allegations.Flake said the FBIís investigation would be limited in time and scope, only to the two ìcredibleî allegations against Kavanaugh, but he also said he hoped the FBI would follow up on any leads from their initial interviews.During the event on Tuesday, where he spoke next to his good friend Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), he rued the partisanship of todayís politics, and said he hoped to stay involved after he leaves the Senate in November.

Ö [A]nd he wasnít about to be nominated to a lifetime position.îWhile discussing Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, anchor Jake Tapper said, ìYou write glowingly about Ted Kennedy. But I want to ask you, because, Iíve heard Ted Kennedyís name invoked in the last week or two and Bill Clintonís name invoked in the last week or two, by conservatives saying, Democrats ceded the moral high ground on a lot of these sexual assault and sexual harassment issues by standing by people like Bill Clinton and Ted Kennedy because of the good things, in their view, that they did.îKerry responded, ìI donít think thatís an accurate way to say it. Many of us were very critical of President Clinton on the choice he made with respect to what happened in the White House. We just didnít believe ó I didnít believe, and I speak for myself, that it was an impeachable offense. Thatís the issue.îTapper then asked about Kennedy, and Kerry answered, ìSimilarly, people have been critical through the years, where ó and he was critical of himself. He stood up and owned moments where he knew heíd stepped over the line. So, I think that ó and he wasnít about to be nominated to a lifetime position. In fact, he said to the people of Massachusetts, if you think I shouldnít stay here, then, you know ó and he took those returns and then he was elected another six times. Thatís a very different thing from a lifetime confirmation to the Supreme†Court of the United States, where you may have to rule on some of these issues that come up.îFollow Ian†Hanchett on Twitter†@IanHanchett

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/nbcs-kate-snow-my-interview-shows-julie-swetnick-has-credibility-issues/,"NBC News†national correspondent Kate Snow said Tuesday,†Julie Swetnick, the third woman to accuse Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, has credibility issues following their sit-down interview.A transcript is as follows:†MELVIN: Credibility, does [Julie Swetnick] have credibility issues?SNOW: I would say yes, because, there are, just to be clear, things that she said to me that differ from her initial statement, which was a sworn statement from last week submitted to the [Senate] Judiciary Committee. That in many peopleís minds raises a credibility question. Republicans have repeatedly raised that sheís been involved in lawsuits and some other things that they say question her credibility. The interview itself, again if you watch the whole thing, youíll see even her description of how and why she came forward and when is a little unclear. Itís a little bit hazy. There were moments in the interview, if you watch it, I think youíll see that she seems a little unsure.MELVIN: So, her motivations for coming forward for right now, we donít know precisely what those are?SNOW: Well, she says she wants to be interviewed by the FBI. To tell her side of it, she has a story to tell and she says she wants it heard. She doesnít see why her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, they donít see why the†FBI wouldnít talk to her because as†Avenatti said to me, ëif sheís telling the truth, the FBI is going to see that and if sheís lying, the FBI will see that.í What are they scared of was his point of view.MELVIN: How did she explain the differences between what she said to you and the claims she made in that sworn statement?SNOW: I think she would say sheís just being more descriptive now. For example, the punch, everybodyís heard this notion that the punch was spiked at these parties. In her statement last week, she said that she had heard this, that Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge his friend, were spiking the punch. In my interview with her, she didnít go that far. She said ëwell, I saw them around the punch bowlí and I asked her directly, ëdid you see Brett Kavanaugh spike the punch and try to get girls drunk or put quaaludes in the punch and she said ëno, I never saw that.í So, thereís a discrepancy†between the two things.†

In one poll from the Judicial Crisis Network (JCN), 56 percent of North Dakotans want Kavanaugh confirmed, while only 26 oppose his confirmation. Fifty-eight percent of West Virginians want Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court, compared to 28 percent who do not want the Senate to confirm Kavanaugh.Breitbart News reported that these polls suggest that if Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) were to vote against Kavanaugh, they could see a significant electoral backlash.A similar phenomenon was noted in a Remington Research Group survey which found that 49 percent of voters said that they are less likely to vote for Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) now that she signaled that she will vote against Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/report-fbi-kavanaugh-probe-to-finish-by-wednesday/,"The FBIís seventh background investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaugh, prompted by Sen. Jeff Flakeís (R-AZ) insistence, will conclude Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, according to a Tuesday Wall Street Journal report.Citing sources familiar, the WSJ claims the probe will finish sooner than the supposedly hard Friday deadline Flake laid out in his impromptu announcement at last Fridayís Senate Judiciary Committee vote that he would need a new FBI investigation before he voted on Kavanaughís confirmation on the Senate floor.The investigation, a demand from Senate Democrats and the broader political left since shortly after Kavanaughís first accuser Christine Blasey Fordís 36-year old allegation went public, became a reality after Flake met with Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) just ahead of Fridayís committee vote. Although Flake voted, along with the rest of the committeeís Republicans, to recommend Kavanaugh for confirmation, he was allowed to speak ahead of the vote and stated he would not vote without a new FBI investigation to last not longer than one week.Since Friday, the FBI has been interviewing parties related to the various allegations from Kavanaughís high school and college years, most prominently his high school friend and alleged accomplice Mark Judge. This represents the seventh time the FBI has looked into Kavanaughís background since he began working on sensitive matters as a government attorney in the early 1990s. The sixth investigation concluded this summer in relation to his Supreme Court nomination.Since the start of this latest investigation, Democrats and the left-leaning press have focused increasingly on Kavanaughís history with alcohol, as opposed to the actual allegation of sexual misconduct. For example, the New York Times published a piece on Kavanaugh having possibly thrown ice at someone during a bar room scuffle in 1985, apparently in an attempt to discredit the nomineeís characterization of his youthful partying.In† a press conference call Tuesday morning, the Judicial Crisis Network, the leading outside group supporting Kavanaughís nomination, pushed back on notions that Kavanaughís history with alcohol had been insufficiently examined in the six previous FBI investigations.ìIn these background investigations ó and now thereís been half a dozen of Kavanaugh over his life ó itís a standard question for every single witness they talk to: ëDo you have any knowledge of alcohol or substance abuse by the nominee?íî Gregg Nunziata, former chief nominations counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee said in response to a Breitbart News inquiry. ìWe can know without knowing whatís in that file ó we can know that hundreds of people who have known the judge over his career have been asked that specific question and that information would already be in the file.îEarlier on Tuesday, the Senate leadership of each party gave a press availability in the capitol. There, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) made clear that he expected the FBI to finish the probe ìsoonî and reiterated his guarantee that the final vote on Kavanaugh would come ìthis week.îSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), at the same podium, emphasized that any delays in Kavanaughís vote were not Democratsí doing, but that of Flake and fellow reputed swing-vote Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Susan Collins (R-ME). He issued new demands on the White House that they publicly disclose the directive for the new investigation. He also chose a new tack in his opposition to Kavanaughís nomination, focusing not on the various uncorroborated allegations of sexual misconduct from Kavanaughís teenage years, but on the ìpartisanshipî he displayed at his fiery appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week.Breitbart Newsís Penny Starr contributed to the reporting in this article.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/fitton-there-are-no-credible-allegations-against-kavanaugh/,"Leftists are trying to kick the Senate confirmation for a Supreme Court nominee down field and past the November elections.They have shown they will do so at any cost. While compelling emotionally, Christine Blasey Ford has no witnesses and no facts to back up her story.There was no legitimate reason the allegations were not summarily evaluated, and a Judiciary Committee vote was taken last week.I was honored to be able to attend Fridayís Kavanaugh hearing ñ a hearing that should never have taken place. It was intense, dramatic, emotional, and outrageous, but nothing changed. The allegations are not sufficient to derail Judge Brett Kavanaughís nomination.Leftist law breaking, rule breaking, violence, and disruption have already marred the public Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. The Senate has allowed this circus to continue, and in the process has delayed a timely confirmation vote on Judge Kavanaugh.The vote to confirm canít come soon enough. That the Senate hasnít voted yet is shameful.The Senate Judiciary Committee issued a statement requesting that the administration instruct the FBI to conduct a supplemental FBI background investigation with respect to the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court.The Senate request was for the FBI to investigation ìcredible allegations.î There are no ìcredible allegations.îNevertheless, President Trump authorized the supplemental investigation as requested.If fairly conducted, this ìsupplemental investigationî could have been over yesterday. The Committee requested that the FBI investigation take no more than a week. This will not satisfy Leftists trying to destroy Kavanaugh.After witnessing the spectacle in person yesterday, the Senate owes Judge Kavanaugh an apology. And perhaps the best apology would be a vote finally to confirm him.Tom Fitton is president of Judicial Watch.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/cory-booker-kavanaugh-disqualified-whether-hes-innocent-or-guilty/,"Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) said Tuesday that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaughís nomination should not move forward regardless of whether the judge is ìinnocentî of sexual misconduct allegations leveled against him.Speaking before reporters on Capitol Hill, Booker said of Kavanaughís nomination:My hope is, beyond the vicious partisan rancor that is going on, beyond the accusations, we donít lose sight of what this moral moment is about in this country, and ultimately†ask ourselves the question: is this the right person to sit on the highest court in the land for a lifetime appointment? When their credibility has been challenged by intimates, people that knew the candidate well, as a classmate. When his temperament has been revealed in an emotional moment, where he used language that, frankly, shocked a lot of us. And then†ultimately, not whether heís innocent or guilty ó this is not a trial ó but†ultimately, has enough questions be raised that we should not move on to another candidate?ÖUltimately, the Supreme Court is not an entitlement. Just because you went to Yale or were president of your class doesnít entitle you to the Supreme Court. This is a sacred institution and the people who should be on it ó whether you disagree with their political or judicial philosophy†at all ó the people who should be on the Supreme Court should preserve the integrity†of the court, and be beyond the reproach of these difficult partisan times.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/kirk-clarence-thomass-high-tech-lynching-awakened-andrew-breitbart-what-will-the-kavanaugh-witch-trial-produce/,"How is a warrior like Andrew Breitbart created? Little did the leftists know as they tried to destroy Clarence Thomas they were creating the most effective grassroots warrior against the left of our generation. And this last week with Kavanaugh, I canít imagine how many more thousands of Andrew Breitbarts were born.Conversions and spiritual awakenings are very familiar to those who are Christians. From the beginning, our faith has relied on people who didnít believe having some form of revelation or experience that motivated them to become one of us.No character in the history of Christianity has a more dramatic story of conversion, or a more significant post-conversion contribution to the faith, than does the Jewish-born Saul, call him Paul, call him St. Paul.Saul, a notorious persecutor of Christians on behalf of Rome, was riding on the road to Damascus with his henchman to do just that when, as they neared the city, an incredible display of light appeared, so vibrant it knocked Saul from his horse.Blinded temporarily, Saul heard the voice of Jesus ask him why he was behaving so badly? This led to Saulís conversion, a clever name change, and to a missionary journey that places him at the top of the list of all-time Christian evangelists.Much like Paul, a famous convert to liberty, and the one who played the most important post-conversion role in standing up to the ruling class and powerful institutions was Andrew Breitbart, founder of Breitbart News.Breitbartís conversion story is available to listen to in his own words and this is a great week for every American liberal to click on ìPlay.îAndrew was raised in California and was a product of that reflexively liberal climate. He admits to taking being a liberal for granted until, in his early 20ís, he witnessed a horrific national event:The confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas and the random insertion of Anita Hill into the process.Andrew watched and wondered what was going on. He couldnít understand how the NAACP would stand by and let a black man be accused of something like this and not stand up to protect his rights. He couldnít understand why the National Organization for Women would blindly support someone coming forth so late with accusations.Andrew thought those groups were supposed to be about fairness and protecting the rights of the underdogs.Silly Andrew.Once awakened, Andrew Breitbart became curious, he became informed, and he became active.† Boy did he become active! Today, Breitbart News stands virtually alone in presenting an uncompromising exposure of Team Left tactics and giving a large platform to the works of James OíKeefe, John Nolte, and others.What is on display to Americans in the Brett Kavanaugh proceeding should be able to produce a few million Andrew Breitbart-types (getting another Andrew Breitbart is too much to ask). For people who are following these proceedings from the Team Left bleachers, here are some things I suggest you keep an eye on:Where is the ACLU insisting that someone cannot be considered guilty simply under the weight of an accusation?Why is the media not doing any feature stories using mothers of sons who are worried about the future their kids will face?Where was the coverage of the womanís march at the Capitol prior to the Thursday hearing showing women demanding Kavanaugh be treated fairly? Where were the Democrats, champions of womenís rights, demanding that these women be heard?Why is the FBI, a federal agency operated at taxpayer expense, being used as part of a show investigation when it has already investigated Judge Kavanaugh for months?These are the kinds of questions Andrew Breitbart would have been asking himself if he had been watching this as a California ìdudeî in his early 20ís. These are the kinds of questions he would be asking America if he were still with us today.I predict that the Kavanaugh confirmation proceedings, which resemble burlesque more than they do any sort of dignified process, will produce a significant number of converts. With my ear to the wind I hear not only the spirit of Andrew Breitbart screaming for political fairness, I also hear St. Paul preaching the immorality of condemning a man solely on specious accusations.Being a partisan requires the complete suspension of intellect. You must say to yourself, ìI know Iím going to be confronted with challenging facts today that subvert my position, but by God I promise to ignore all of them.î St. Paul, when confronted with bright light and Christís voice, was able to open his blind eyes to see God. Andrew Breitbart confronted with blatant partisanship opened his eyes to see the American Dream.American liberals, when you open your eyes you arenít going to believe what you see. If you experience a spiritual awakening and are ready to convert, we will be waiting for you when you get here.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/10/02/cnns-jake-tapper-heard-enough-men-kavanaugh/,"CNN host Jake Tapper said that when it came to Brett Kavanaugh, he felt like ìweíd heard from men enoughî during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on Monday.ìIíve had all-women panels lots of times, but it is true that this Sunday, I felt that weíd heard from men enough,î Jake Tapper said, referencing the fact that he had an all-female panel on CNNís†State of the Union this weekend.Of course, Tapper doesnít think America heard enough from one manóhimself.Jake Tapper, a white male with a privileged upbringing, wouldnít pass up an invitation to appear on another white male, Stephen Colbertís show, and indeed, despite saying that ìweíd heard from men enough,î he spoke at length about the allegations against Kavanaugh during his appearance, taking up precious TV time that could have been filled with a womanís opinion.Apparently, men have been heard from enough, unless they work for CNN.CNN White House reporter Jim Acosta said something similar during a press conference with President Trump last week.Acosta, upon being called on by Trump, said, ìThank you very much. If you donít mind, after Iím finished, ifÖone of our female colleagues could go after me, that would be great.îOf course, Acosta asked his question first, before a woman could be called on.CNNís Jeffrey Toobin also mocked white men on air Tuesday morning.In response to Donald Trump Jr. saying that he was more concerned about his sons than his daughters in the #MeToo era, Toobin mocked him, saying, ìEvery night, I cry myself to sleep over the fate of white men in America. White men have no power, white menóI mean, itís such garbage.îìYou know what? If you sexually assault someone in high school, your life should be ruined, your life should be pursued,î he continued.ìThe idea that this is somehow unjustñremember, this all started with accusations of sexual assault. How about the lives of the women who were sexually assaulted in high school? How about 15-year-old Ms. Blasey, she wasnít Ms. Blasey Ford in those days, how about her life?

I voted against nominees from President George W. Bush on the basis of, you know, their positions. But I donít remember any of them, nor the most recent appointment by President Trump of Neil Gorsuch, behaving in such a way. I regret they take the stand they take. I worry about the consequences of their will affecting so many people and their lives and our country as a whole, but this latest example is in a different category. We have not seen anything quite like that for a long time. You know, Clarence Thomas vigorously defended himself, as some of them can remember. It was a very painful and difficult time for Anita Hill and many watching because it felt like, and probably was, a denial of the legitimacy of womenís stories. In this case, though, the performance, the behavior, was quite out of bounds. I donít ever remember anything like that.îShe added, ìSo there is such a thing that you seek in judges of a judicious temperament, people who are able to discipline themselves to be open to the evidence wherever it might lead, to be fair to all the litigants appearing before them. Iím a recovering lawyer. I used to practice law, and I was in different kinds of courts, and this was quite unusual what we saw the other day, and certainly, the senators should, on both side of the aisle, take that into account.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/nyt-brett-kavanaugh-may-thrown-ice-someone-1985-bar-fight/,"The New York Times†unveiled a new allegation against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh on Monday: he was questioned by police about throwing ice in a bar altercation during his junior year of college.The Times was alerted about a 1985 scuffle at a bar near Yale University following a UB40 concert by Chad Ludington, Kavanaughís one-time Yale drinking companion†who came forward Saturday to claim Kavanaugh was not being completely truthful about the extent of his college-aged drinking during his Senate testimony.In following up, the New York Times obtained a New Haven, Connecticut, police report about the fight from 1:20 a.m. that September. Kavanaugh was not, according to the report, arrested, and no charges stemmed from the altercation. He was, however, questioned after a 21-year-old bar patron named†Dom Cozzolino claimed Kavanaugh threw ice at him ìfor some unknown reason.îAccording to Ludington, the incident broke out because Cozzolino started swearing at him, Kavanaugh, and a third Yale student, Chris Dudley, because he thought they were staring. Ludington claims they were trying to figure out in Cozzolino was†Ali Campbell, the lead singer of UB40.The Times writes that the police report notes Cozzolino had a cut on his ear, which he claimed resulted when Dudley hit him with a glass. Dudley disputed this in the report.According to Ludington, Dudley hit him after Cozzolino swung at and then grabbed Kavanaugh in response to the incident with the ice. ìI then tried to pull Chris back, and a bunch of other guys tried to pull the other guy back,î Ludington told the Times. I donít know what Brett was doing in the melee, but there was blood, there was glass, there was beer and there was some shouting, and the police showed up.îDudley, who later became an NBA basketball player and came within one-and-a-half points of winning the Oregon governorís race as a Republican in 2010, has strongly backed Kavanaugh, disputing insinuations that the nomineeís youthful drinking was problematic. Dudley told the Washington Post that Kavanaugh partied ìjust like any college kid in Americaî and told BuzzFeed, ìI never, ever saw him blacked out, never. Ö Brett would drink, but heíd also be the guy who never missed a class. Thereís a reason he was top of his class.îLudington described Kavanaugh as ìa frequent drinker, and a heavy drinkerî who was ìoften belligerent and aggressive.î He admits that he, too, lived a partying lifestyle in college. ìI do not believe that the heavy drinking or even loutish behavior of an 18- or even 21-year-old should condemn a person for the rest of his life. I would be a hypocrite to think so,î he said in his first public statement about the matter.Ludington is now a North Carolina State University history professor. The Times initially reported him as a Democrat donor but removed that information, evidently when it became clear the donations came from his father, who has a similar name. A significant portion of his scholarship deals with the history of wine and drinking. Past papers include ìThe Politics of Drunkenness in Britain, 1780-1820î and ìBy God, he drinks like a man!: Wine, Masculinity and Britishness.îOne of the†co-authors of the New York Times†story revealing the ice-throwing allegation also features in the wider debate about Kavanaugh. Emily Bazelon, like Kavanaugh, is a Yale undergrad and law school alum, having started at the prestigious university as Kavanaugh was in law school there. She apparently included her own knowledge of the 1980s Yale bar scene in the story, describing the site of Kavanaughís alleged ice slinging as†ìa well-known local bar that served big slices of pizza, and cheap beer, especially after 9 p.m.îShe has been vocal in her opposition to Judge Kavanaugh, expressing her displeasure when professors at Yale Law, where she is a part-time lecturer, praised Kavanaughís accomplishments and intellect just after his nomination:As a @YaleLawSch grad & lecturer, I strongly disassociate myself from tonightís praise of Brett Kavanaugh. With respect, heís a 5th vote for a hard-right turn on voting rights and so much more that will harm the democratic process & prevent a more equal society. 1/2ó Emily Bazelon (@emilybazelon) July 10, 2018After the Times published her piece, the Yale Law graduate, Bazelon, claimed, without citing her source, Ludington, that she was ìtoldî Kavanaugh might, in fact, have been arrested, only to have it expunged later:No report of an arrest. Could have been expunged, Iím told. https://t.co/W3J4wr2Sp7ó Emily Bazelon (@emilybazelon) October 1, 2018President Donald Trump continued to beat back the attacks against his nominee under combative questioning from CNNís Kaitlan Collins at his announcement about North American trade Monday morning. ìI watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man with drinking,î Trump said of Kavanaughís hearing testimony. ìHow íbout the last twenty years? Because nobody said anything bad about him in the last twenty years. They go back to high school. îThe president continued his support for Kavanaugh at his Monday Tennessee rally for GOP Senate nominee Rep. Marsha Blackburn. ìTheyíve been trying to destroy him since the very first second he was announced because they know Judge Kavanaugh will follow the Constitution as written,î Trump said at the Johnson City, Tennessee, rally. ìHeís a good man, great student, great intellect, never had a problem. All of a sudden, ëOh, letís go back to high schoolí; then maybe you should go before high school.î

Manchin had a 46 percent favorable rating, while 33 percent had a negative view of the Democrat senator. Morrisey, in contrast, had a 34 percent favorable rating, and a 44 percent unfavorable rating. More West Virginians were unfamiliar with West Virginia Attorney General Morrisey, whereas, more citizens knew of Manchin, who previously served as the stateís governor.Sixty-two percent approved†President Donald Trump, while only 34 percent disapprove of the president. Fifty-eight percent of poll respondents said that they voted for Trump during the 2016 presidential election, while only 24 percent voted for Hillary Cliton.Sen. Machin faces increasing pressure to support Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. Fifty-four percent of West Virginians support the confirmation of Kavanaugh, while only 27 percent oppose the nomineeís confirmation to the nationís highest court.A similar poll from the West Virginia Metro News found that 58 percent of West Virginians want Kavanaugh confirmed, while only 28 percent do not want him confirmed.New poll shows West Virginians support Kavanaugh confirmation by a 30-point margin, 58-28.  cc: @JoeManchinWV #WVSen #SCOTUS https://t.co/kB20SpDOJyó Senate Leadership Fund (@Senate_Fund) September 28, 2018Another survey released last week from 1892 Polling found that Morrisey is tied with Manchin, with 45 percent each. The poll also found that Morrisey leads with independent voters by four points.Morrisey continues to argue that Sen. Machin is complicit in the Senate Democratsí ìdisgraceful treatment of Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh. The West Virginia AG said that Manchin has been following Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumerís (D-NY) strategy to prevent Kavanaugh form joining the nationís highest court.ìRegardless of how he votes, Joe Manchin has proven to be complicit in Senate Democratsí disgraceful treatment†of President Trumpís Supreme Court pick,î said Morrisey. ìThe voters of West Virginia can fully expect the resist†and obstruct circus to be unleashed if Joe Manchin, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and Maxine Waters take control of Congress.îSchumer, immediately after Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, announced that he will oppose Kavanaugh ìwith everything I haveî because the ìstakes are simply too high.îImmediately after Manchin left his meeting with Kavanaugh, the West Virginia Democrat†went†straight to Schumerís office.Schumer suggested in July that vulnerable Senate Democrats should hold off on their decision whether to support Kavnaaugh as long as possible.Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL)†said, ìAll Chuck ever says in caucus [meetings], itís pretty well known: ëKeep your powder dry. Donít commit. Stay as neutral as you can, as long as you can.îMorrisey contended that Manchin holding his vote until the last-minute has given Schumer room to maneuver, and hopefully, tank the nominee.Morrisey charged, ìThe bottom line, Manchin should be ashamed for giving Schumer and Senate Democrats the ëroom to maneuverí to ultimately try to destroy President Trumpís Supreme Court nominee.î

She is not a news reporter,î the Timesí statement reads. ìHer role in this story was to help colleagues in the newsroom gather public documents in New Haven, where Emily is based. In retrospect, editors should have used a newsroom reporter for that assignment. To be clear, the story is straightforward, fact-based and we fully stand behind it.îAccording to the Times pieces, Kavanaugh tossed ice at a man during an altercation at a New Haven, Connecticut bar after a†UB40 concert†in 1985. The future Supreme Court nominee, who was later questioned about the alleged incident by police, was not arrested or charged in relation to the brief scuttle.The Times failed to disclose that the article, co-authored by Emily Bazelon and Ben Protess, was written by at least one individual who has publicly announced her opposition to Kavanaugh.ìAs a @YaleLawSch grad & lecturer, I strongly disassociate myself from tonightís praise of Brett Kavanaugh,î Bazelon tweeted on July 9 ó the day President Donald Trump announced Kavanaughís nomination. ìWith respect, heís a 5th vote for a hard-right turn on voting rights and so much more that will harm the democratic process & prevent a more equal society.îAs a @YaleLawSch grad & lecturer, I strongly disassociate myself from tonightís praise of Brett Kavanaugh.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/02/poll-60-want-kavanaugh-confirmed-if-fbi-dismisses-allegations/,"If the FBI clears Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct allegations this week, 60 percent of Americans want him confirmed to the Supreme Court.The Harvard CAPS/Harris poll of 1,330 registered voters also found some other interesting nuggets that are good news for Kavanaugh and his supporters.The top line numbers show that 40 percent found only Christine Blasey Fordís Thursday testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee ìcredible.î Ford testified that when they were both teenagers, Kavanaugh attempted to assault her at a 1982 house party.By comparison, only 23 percent said they found only Kavanaughís rebuttal testimony ìcredible.îHowever, 27 percent of those polled found both Kavanaugh and Ford ìcredible,î which means a total of 50 percent found Kavanaugh credible, compared to 67 percent for Ford.Here is where things get interestingÖìBut the credibility of their testimony does not appear to be the decisive factor,î pollster Mark Penn writes. ìRather, the question comes down to corroboration as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should ascend to the high court.îAs of now, in the wake of the testimony, only 37 percent want Kavanaugh confirmed, but only 44 percent say he should not be confirmed.

To begin with ì69 percent agree with Kavanaughís pronouncement and Sen.†Lindsey Grahamís (R-S.C.) statement that the proceedings have been a national disgrace.îSecondly, the poll found that a whopping 75 percent believe Sen.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/woman-who-confronted-jeff-flake-in-elevator-leads-soros-funded-activist-group/,"NEW YORK ó Ana Maria Archila, one of the two women who confronted Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake in an elevator on Friday, helps lead a progressive organization funded by billionaire George Soros that heads an $80 million activist effort characterized as part of the anti-Trump ìresistanceî movement.Archila and a second woman, 23-year-old Maria Gallagher, both said that they survived sexual assault when they challenged Flake as he entered an elevator prior to his Senate Judiciary Committee vote on whether to approve the nomination of President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.Ultimately, Flake prompted a new FBI investigation into Kavanaugh as a condition for moving forward with the nomination. When asked whether the elevator confrontation contributed to his decision, Flake told the Atlantic that the moment had been ìpoignantî for him and ìit certainly struck a chord.îFlake credited his decision mostly to what he said was his desire to preserve the Supreme Court. ìI donít know if there was any one thing, but I was just unsettled,î he added.Outside the elevator on Friday, Archila yelled at the senator: ìWhat you are doing is allowing someone who actually violated a woman to sit on the Supreme Court.îìThis is not tolerable,î she added. ìYou have children in your family. Think about them.îArchila is not just an ordinary concerned citizen. She is a professional activist. She serves as co-executive director at the Soros-funded Center for Popular Democracy (CPD) and maintains the same position as the groupís activist arm, the Center for Popular Democracy Action.As reported by the Washington Free Beacon, Archila penned a piece posted on the CPDís website taking credit for actions that left Flake ìvisibly shaken:îShe wrote:Just a few hours ago, a courageous young woman and I confronted Senator Jeff Flake on an elevator about his statement that he would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In a now-viral video, Flake could not even look us in the eyes when we shared with him our experiences of sexual assault. He would not make eye contact with me when I asked him to think about my children, and his own children.Shortly after, CNN reported that Flake was visibly shaken after his encounter with us. Our words, and the words of thousands of women who have shared their stories, moved him. Within hours, the senator announced he would seek an investigation from the FBI into Dr. Fordís accusations of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh, delaying the Senateís confirmation vote.CPD is highly involved in anti-Trump activism. In May 2017, CNN reported that the Center for Popular Democracy Action fund unveiled an ì$80 million effort to coordinate the work of dozens of smaller progressive groups from around the countryî as part of what the news network characterized as the anti-Trump ìresistanceî movement. Just as she does with the parent group, Archila serves as co-executive director at the Center for Popular Democracy Action Fund.Since it is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit political organization, the CPD action fund is not required to publicly release its donor†list. However, the fund and its associated main group, Archilaís Center for Popular Democracy, both have been financed by Soros, as the Free Beacon reported.In October 2014, literature that was part of a CPD event listed Sorosís Open Society Foundations as one of CPDís ìthree biggest funders.î† The Foundations provided the CPD with $130,000 in 2014 and $1,164,500 in 2015, tax documents show.In 2016, Sorosís Open Society Policy Center provided $705,000 to the Center for Popular Democracyís Action Fund.CPDís agenda items run the gamut of general national progressive politics, including ìRacial Justice,î ìCombating Wage Theft,î ìOrganizing for Climate Justice,î ìOrganizing for Education Justice,î ìImmigrant Rights,î ìWall Street Accountabilityî and ìVoting Rights.îThe CPD and the Make the Road New York immigrant activist group, which has also been led by Archila, partnered last April to form another anti-Trump activist outfit calling itself Corporate Backers of Hate. That Corporate group aims to ìname and shameî any companies they claim are either working with Trump or making money from what the group claims is Trumpís ìanti-immigrant, anti-workerî agenda.The anti-Trump Corporate groupís website is set up for activists to send messages to the CEOs and board members of nine major companies, including IBM, Disney, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs.ìWe are convinced they have the capacity to move the Trump Administration,î Archila told Time magazine of the project last year. ìAnd to the extent that they are quietly placating the behavior of this White House, they are just as complicit as Ivanka Trump.îWriting at National Review, John Fund documented Archilaís ties to the CPD and also noted she is a national committee member of the Working Families Party, which has long had close links to the now-defunct, controversial ACORN.Fund criticized the media for failing to detail Archilaís activism beyond cursory mention of her group:I have no doubt that the vast majority of protesters who want to stop Brett Kavanaugh are sincere and are merely exercising their constitutional rights. But imagine if two women had cornered a Democratic senator in an elevator and demanded an investigation of who had leaked to the media Christine Blasey Fordís letter alleging that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her. (Senator Lindsey Graham said today that he planned to investigate the leak.) There would have been sputtering outrage in media circles, and reporters would have breathlessly hunted down any ties between the women and outside groups.Itís a sign of media bias that the people from the well-funded groups behind the anti-Kavanaugh protests are described merely as ìactivistsî and that their political motives and origins are largely unexplored.Aaron Klein is Breitbartís Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

He told rally-goers, ìa vote for Morrisey is a vote for me Ö [and a vote for] West Virginia values and keep[ing] America great.î He also described Manchin as a supporter of ìmass amnestyî who sides with ìradical open-borderî Democrats.During the rally, Morrisey described Manchin as a ìdishonest Washington liberal,î while promising to ìadvance Trumpís agendaî if elected to the Senate.Last week, Morrisey said in a statement that Manchin is complicit in Senate Democratsí ìdisgraceful treatmentî of Kavanaugh and that Manchin followed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumerís (D-NY) orders since Kavanaughís nomination.Morrisey slammed Senate Democratsí tactics to disrupt and defame Judge Kavanaugh during the Supreme Court nomination process. The West Virginia Republican contended that the Democratic senator was complicit in Senate Judiciary ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumerís (D-NY) strategy to prevent Kavanaugh from joining the nationís highest court.ìRegardless of how he votes, Joe Manchin has proven to be complicit in Senate Democratsí disgraceful treatment†of President Trumpís Supreme Court pick,î said Morrisey. ìThe voters of West Virginia can fully expect the resist†and obstruct circus to be unleashed if Joe Manchin, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and Maxine Waters take control of Congress.îA Thursday-published poll from 1892 Polling shows Manchin and Morrisey tied in support among likely West Virginia voters, with both at 45 percent. Breitbart News reported on the poll:The poll also finds that Morrisey leads amongst independent voters by four pointsó41 to 37 percent; however, 22 percent of independent voters have yet to make up their minds.Thursdayís poll also found that President Donald Trump has a 57 percent approval rating and 38 percent view Trump unfavorably. Trump won West Virginia during the 2016 presidential election by more than 40 points.An average of West Virginia polls via RealClearPolitics shows Manchin with a 9.3 point lead over Morrisey as of this articleís publication.

If you think this is about searching for the truth, you ought to put down the bong.îAfter seeing a clip of Swetnickís interview with NBC, Kennedy said,†ìThis entire thing makes me want to heave. If you think this is about searching for the truth, you ought to put down the bong. This is not about the truth. This is about gamesmanship and power, political politics. Itís just that simple. Ms. Swetnick, thereís no corroboration. She says that she attended ten gang rapes, at which Judge Kavanaugh was supposedly involved. She didnít report any of them. She is represented by Mr. Avenatti, who has done his dead level best to make all of this about Mr. Avenatti.îHe continued, ìI donít think anybody in the Milky Way could be surprised that the Democrats are yet again moving the goalposts. There is nothing we can do to get our Democratic friends to consider voting for Judge Kavanaugh. The only way to make them happy is to pull him down and I guess dig up Bill Douglas and nominate him, and anybody else who thinks otherwise is just kidding themselves. Look, this is what the Democrats say, they say that Brett Kavanaugh is a rich, drunk, lying, sexual predator. Heís been through six FBI background checks, each of which is a cross between an endoscopy and colonoscopy, and none of this was turned up. Now heís going through the seventh one, which the Democrats demanded, and weíre not even halfway through, probably, and now theyíre unhappy with that.îKennedy later added,†ì[I]tís time for everybody to woman up and man up and be a senator and cast your vote in front of God and country. [I] fully trust the FBI. I want to wait and see what they turn up, but I have a feeling theyíre going to do just what weíve already done, just what they did six previous times. And by the way, it keeps getting lost in this, the Senate Judiciary investigators did a full investigation. All ó the FBI is going to redo what theyíve already done.îHe concluded, ìAnd when we finish with the FBI investigation, the Democrats will argue, well†ó theyíre going to argue he doesnít have the demeanor. Well, they called him a rich, drunk, lying, sexual predator, and the man took offense to that. And they say as a result he doesnít have the demeanor to get on ó to be on the Supreme Court? They must really think the American people are stupid.îFollow Ian†Hanchett on Twitter†@IanHanchett

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/poll-heitkamp-under-water-gops-cramer-by-10-in-north-dakota-senate-race/,"A new poll released on Monday by Valley News Live, the NBC-TV affiliate in Fargo, North Dakota, and Strategic Research Associates, shows that Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND) has jumped to a ten point lead over incumbent Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) in the North Dakota Senate race.The poll of 650 likely voters in North Dakota conducted between September 17 and September 27 shows that Cramer now leads Heitkamp 51 percent to 41 percent, with eight percent undecided. It has a margin of error of 3.5 percent.Cramer has increased his lead over Heitkamp by six points in the past few weeks.A Fox News poll conducted between September 8 and 11, two weeks before the dramatic testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and accuser Dr. Christine Blasey Ford on September 27 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, showed Cramer with a four point lead, 48 percent to 44 percent, which was within the pollís margin of error.Heitkamp is one of two Democrat senators who have not yet announced how they will vote on the confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. The full Senate is expected to vote up or down on his confirmation this Friday.The poll also shows that likely voters in North Dakota overwhelmingly support confirming Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court:In another question that VNL asked, 60% of the likely voters in North Dakota support the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. 27% were opposed.Keep in mind, the poll was conducted during the disclosure that the judge may have engaged in sexual misconduct, while in high school or college, before last weekís testimony by Kavanaugh and one of his accusers, before the Senate Judiciary Committee.In 2016, President Trump won the stateís three electoral college votes by a margin of 36 points over Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton.Heitkampís campaign has stumbled in recent weeks.Last week, she tried to dismiss an attack that criticized her support for sanctuary cities as a ìscare tactic,î as Breitbart News reported:Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp is taking heat for her refusal to ìcrack down on dangerous sanctuary citiesî in an ad released Tuesday.The North Dakota Republican Party ad opens with a narration: ìPresident Trump wants to stop illegal immigration ó but Heidi Heitkamp must not.î Heitkamp faces a tough challenge from Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer.President Donald Trump flashes onto the screen with his comments on Heitkamp at a recent rally: ìHeidi voted in favor of the deadly, very very dangerous, horrible, sanctuary cities.îThe ad points to three opportunities Heitkamp had to vote to defund sanctuary cities but did not. ìWhen Heidi was confronted with her record of failure, she dismissed the issue as a ëscare tactic,íî the ad states.Earlier in September, Heitkampís brother, Joel Heitkamp, a North Dakota talk radio host,†said†in a tweet President Trump will help victims of Hurricane Florence because ìtheyíre white.îAfter #PuertoRico the people on the east coast should worry about the response to #hurricane #Florence. Wait, theyíre white so #Trump will be there for them. No worries! #790KFGO #hopetheyrsafeó Joel Heitkamp (@JoelKFGO) September 12, 2018Sen. Heitkamp is a frequent guest on her brotherís radio show.On Monday, the Cramer campaign took advantage of the momentum in the race by launching a new ad that criticized Heitkamp for voting against President Trumpís Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.Hereís the full transcript of that ad:Iím Kevin Black, president of Creedence Energy Services. President Trumpís tax cuts kicked in pretty quick, and our company jumped at the chance to grow.Did the tax cut make a difference?You bet.Black: We hired 12 new people, and now we are up to 28 good-paying jobs. Our nation is booming, and our economy is creating thousands of new jobs.Black: Thatís why Iím voting for Kevin Cramer.îBlack: I canít believe Heidi Heitkamp would repeal the tax cuts. Try telling that to my new employees.The Cramer campaign statement notes that while he voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, ìSenator Heidi Heitkamp voted against the tax cuts that have benefited North Dakota more than any other state. Heitkamp said she does not regret her opposition to these cuts, and her Democrat party in Washington wants them repealed.îYou can watch the ad here:†††

Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) criticized the one-week deadline in the expanded FBI probe of Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Blumenthal said, ìItís the right direction, but whether they go far enough and quickly enough remains to be seen. Those 25 witnesses that I sent to the White House and to the FBI along with almost all my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Democratic side, are the minimum that ought to be interviewed. As you well know, witnesses can lead to other witnesses that have to be pursued. So I believe that Jeff Flake truly wants a real investigation, not a check the box sham. And thatís what the FBI ought to be doing. Difficult, though, because as you said very well, this deadline is tight and arbitrary. In fact, too accelerated and too artificial to really get the job done.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/josh-hawley-calls-for-special-counsel-to-investigate-feinstein-for-leak-obstructing/,"Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, the Republican nominee challenging Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) in this Novemberís Senate race, called for the establishment of a special counsel to investigate Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and her staff for the leaking of Dr. Christine Blasey Fordís confidential letter in which she accused Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her 36 years ago.ìI am calling for a special counsel to investigate the conduct of Sen. Feinstein, her staff, and all other relevant parties, for violating the confidentiality of Dr. Ford and obstructing the work of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Potentially also of obstructing an FBI background investigation,î Hawley said in a press call Monday morning.Hawley also called on McCaskill to join him in that call for special counsel.ìI know that Sen. McCaskill and Sen. Feinstein are very close. Sen. McCaskill has worked with Sen. Feinstein on immigration and related issues, and, of course, Sen. McCaskill is very closely aligned with Chuck Schumer. However, I call on Sen. McCaskill today to put partisanship aside and support a special counsel to investigate these potential abuses,î Hawley said.ìSen. McCaskill has said they she does not approve of the way the allegations came forward and, quoting her now, she said, ëIt would have been much more ideal if this issue had come up sooner rather than later.í If those statements are true, Sen. McCaskill should support an investigation of the behavior and the tactics used by her Senate Democrat allies,î Hawley noted.McCaskill announced on September 19 that she was opposed to confirming Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. A recent poll in Missouri shows that Hawley now leads McCaskill in that race by two points.ìThe last few weeks have brought disgrace to the United States Senate. The Constitution gives the Senate the high responsibility of confirming justices to the Supreme Court,î Hawley said in a press call Monday morning.Hawleyís full statement, which he delivered on the press call, can be read here:The last few weeks have brought disgrace to the United States Senate. The Constitution gives the Senate the high responsibility of confirming justices to the Supreme Court.The Democrats have turned this responsibility into a partisan circus.Theyíve tried to smear the name of a good man. They have violated the express wishes of Dr. Ford in this process, and all for the purpose of stalling this nomination until after the midterm elections, and gaining power.The behavior of Sen. Feinstein, in particular, and her staff, and all the Senate staff has been inexcusable. It raises troubling ethical questions.Dr. Fordís letter was hidden from the committee for months, while an FBI investigation was ongoing.Then, only after the FBI background investigation was complete, and only after Judge Kavanaugh had set for hours of testimony and answered over 1600 written questions, did Dr. Fordís letter suddenly leak to the press, all without her approval, or her consent. And, we learned at the hearing last Thursday that Sen. Feinstein and her staff recommended a partisan lawyer to Dr. Ford while the letter was being withheld from the committee and the FBI, and while, in fact, they were, Sen. Feinstein was meeting with Judge Kavanaugh. These were deliberate maneuvers by partisan Democrats and their staffs to exploit Dr. Ford and ultimately block Judge Kavanaughís confirmation process.All of this for political gain, and at the price of smearing Judge Kavanaugh. And Claire McCaskill has gone right along with it every step of the way. She told supporters in June, we now know, in a leaked video, that it was vital to save the Supreme Court from President Trump. Chuck Schumer, of course, promised that he would do whatever it took to sink the Kavanaugh nomination, and here we are.This behavior is not only a disgrace to the Senate, it raises very troubling ethical questions, possibly legal questions.And thatís why today I am calling for a special counsel to investigate the conduct of Sen. Feinstein, her staff, and all other relevant parties, for violating the confidentiality of Dr. Ford and obstructing the work of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Potentially also of obstructing an FBI background investigation.I know that Sen. McCaskill and Sen. Feinstein are very close.Sen. McCaskill has worked with Sen. Feinstein on immigration and related issues, and, of course, Sen. McCaskill is very closely aligned with Chuck Schumer.However, I call on Sen. McCaskill today to put partisanship aside and support a special counsel to investigate these potential abuses.Sen. McCaskill has said they she does not approve of the way the allegations came forward and, quoting her now, she said ìIt would have been much more ideal if this issue had come up sooner rather than later.îIf those statements are true, Sen. McCaskill should support an investigation of the behavior and the tactics used by her Senate Democrat allies.ìMy view is the American people deserve to know how Dr. Fordís confidentiality was violated, and what exactly Sen. Feinstein and her Democrat colleagues and staff were doing behind the scenes for months,î Hawley said. (emphasis added)ìIf Sen. McCaskill is in search of the truth, she should join me today in supporting the investigation of Sen. Feinstein, staff, and all relevant parties,î Hawley concluded.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/kamala-harris-presents-letter-claiming-kavanaugh-friend-repeatedly-raped-jane-doe-in-car/,"The Senate Judiciary†Committee questioned†Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh last Wednesday regarding a letter delivered†to Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) in which an anonymous woman claims she was repeatedly raped by the judge without providing any details to investigate.According to committee transcripts released Sunday, the accuser, who signed the mysterious letter as ìJane Doe,î alleges Kavanaugh and a friend raped her ìseveral timesî after giving her a lift home from a party ó making no attempt to claim a time or place for the lurid story.The accuser claims Kavanaugh groped her, slapped her, and force her to perform sexual acts. ìThey forced me to go into the backseat and took 2 turns raping me several times each. They dropped me off 3 two blocks from my home,î the accuser wrote, claiming the pair told her, ìNo one will believe if you tell. Be a good girl.îThe letter, marked with the word ìurgent,î did not include a return address, nor did it offer clues regarding the accuserís background. ìA group of white men, powerful senators who wonít believe me, will come after meî if I reveal the incident, the accuser wrote, prompting†observers to speculate the sender could be a minority.The accusation was met with a vehement†denial from Kavanaugh, who characterized the allegation as nothing short of ìridiculous.îìNothing ever ñ anything like that, nothing,î the Supreme Court nominee told senators concerning the accusation. ìI mean, thatís ñ the whole thing is just a crock, farce, wrong, didnít happen, not anything close.îRead the full letter below (Spaces added for easier reading):Dear, Senator†Grassley, et al.The current situation regarding the accusations made by Dr. Ford against Brett Kavanaugh have prompted me to write you today. I have moved on with my life since he forced himself on me as well. The times were so different, and I didnít expect to be taken seriously, embarrass my family, be believed at all. I was at a party with a friend. I had been drinking. She left with another boy, leaving me to find my own way home. Kavanaugh and a friend offered me a ride home. I donít know the other boyís name. I was in his car to go home. His friend was behind me in the backseat. Kavanaugh kissed me forcefully.I told him I only wanted a ride home. Kavanaugh continued to grope me over my clothes, forcing his kisses on me and putting his hand under my sweater. ëNo,í I yelled at him. The boy in the backseat reached around, putting his hand over my mouth and holding my arm to keep me in the car. I screamed into his hand. Kavanaugh continued his forcing himself on me. He pulled up my sweater and bra exposing my breasts, and reached into my panties, inserting his fingers into my vagina. My screams were silenced by the boy in the backseat covering my mouth and groping me as well. Kavanaugh slapped me and told me to be quiet and forced me to perform oral sex on him. He climaxed in my mouth. They forced me to go into the backseat and took turns raping me several times each.They dropped me off two blocks from my home. ëNo one will believe if you tell. Be a good girl,í he told me. Watching what has happened to Anita Hill and Dr. Ford has me petrified to come forward in person or even provide my name. A group of white men, powerful senators who wonít believe me, will come after me. Like Dr. Ford, Iím a teacher, I have an education, a family, a child, a home. I have credibility. Just because something happens a long time ago, because a rape victim doesnít want to personally come forward, does not mean something canít be true.Jane Doe, Oceanside, California.On Monday, the White House issued revised guidance to the FBI that agents can interview anyone they deem relevant as part of their investigation of Kavanaugh. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to reopen Kavanaughís background investigation Friday after several women accused Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.Speaking at a White House Rose Garden event, President Trump told reporters that he continues to support Kavanaugh, describing him as a ìfine man.î ìI think heís a great scholar Ö he focused on being number one at Yale, on being number one in high school, at being number one at law,î the president added. ìI can so understand that.îKavanaugh has strongly denied all allegations, issuing the following statement through the White House on Friday:ìThroughout this process, Iíve been interviewed by the FBI, Iíve done a number of ëbackgroundí calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me. Iíve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate.îAccording to multiple reports, the investigation could wind down as earlier as Monday or Tuesday.GOP senator tells me that @senatemajldr told WH Friday the 3 key GOP Senators wanted the FBI to interview 4 people: PJ Smyth, Leland Keyser, Mark Judge & Deborah Ramirez.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/the-nuclear-option-when-evidence-no-longer-matters/,"These are lonely times. The whole world, it seems, is talking past each other, not listening. Whatever vestiges of civility were left after the 2016 election has vanished.People are openly judged as trash and liars ó entirely based on their gender.Which is kind of strange, considering that gender is supposed to be so fluid these days. Perhaps the world would calm down if we just all went the way of Bruce Jenner.If all men would just become women, humans would presumably no longer be able to procreate. (Ladies, you have not quite rendered us useless yet!) And then humans would die off like the greedy dinosaurs we are and the planet would be left to the peaceful, righteous and just animals.TRIGGER WARNING: If this is what you think you want, do NOT watch footage of wild animals on the Serengeti. It is savage justice where might makes right. It is more appalling than Harvey Weinsteinís casting couch or former President Bill Clintonís intern program. Itís even worse than a toga keg party at Yale Law.We are so broken today that everybody says last weekís Senate Judiciary Committee hearing featuring Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh and his accuser did not change a single mind. That is not true.My mind was entirely changed by the gut-wrenching testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.Going in, I thought she was a lying opportunist who popped up on the scene at the very last minute to derail Judge Kavanaughís nomination to the Supreme Court. By her own admission, the first time she ever uttered the manís name to someone else was when she thought he might get nominated to the Supreme Court.When she spoke, however, I could not help but find her believable ó if a bit daffy.Then Judge Kavanaugh spoke. He was every bit as convincing. Understandably, he was furious over the injustice of being accused of something he knows he did not do. (Despite the babbling of Democrats on the committee, rage against injustice is a GOOD quality in a judge, not a bad quality.)So, what do you do when you have two believable witnesses describing starkly different versions of events from nearly 40 years ago? You look at all the other evidence.From the outset, Judge Kavanaugh is at a disadvantage since he has to prove a negative. Even worse, the accusation against him doesnít even come with a date or a location.Still, Judge Kavanaugh comes off as a better witness because Dr. Fordís testimony ó as earnest as it seemed ó is riddled with holes and saddled with inconsistencies. Even worse, Dr. Fordís story has altered over time.Who was there? Where? How many people? Was the guy she was ìgoing out withî at the time there or not?And then there are the tricks of memory. Surely, traumatic incidents burn more deeply. But this is a person who could not even answer who is paying her legal bills.And we are expected to trust her precise memory from 36 years ago and use that memory to utterly destroy a man who has spent his entire adult life building an impressive career and impeccable reputation?At the very, very, very least, we should summon the spirit of the late Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter, who famously invoked Scottish Law to find impeachment charges against ex-President Bill Clinton ìnot proven.îOnly this time, the verdict would actually fit.ï Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.

But this case is even weaker than that. Dr. Ford identified other witnesses to the event, and those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them. For the reasons discussed below, I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee. Nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.Mitchell also pointed out that in addition to a discrepancy in the number of people at the party and other conflicting details of what unfolded there, all of the witnesses Ford named have either outright denied her claims or have not corroborated them.Mitchellís report also concluded that ìthe activities of congressional Democrats and Dr. Fordís attorneys likely affected Dr. Fordís account.îMitchell heads the Special Victims Division at the Maricopa County Attorneyís Office in Phoenix, Arizona,†which covers sex crimes and family violence.

The reported change allows the Bureau to interview ìanyone it deems necessaryî to answer questions about accusations against Kavanaugh, all brought forth after his confirmation hearings had already concluded.Speaking before reporters in the White Houseís Rose Garden on Monday, President Trump reiterated†his support for a†fair and thorough†investigation†into the Supreme Court nominee.†ìWe donít want to go on a witch hunt, do we?î the president asked†reporters, a reference to special counsel Robert Muellerís investigation into possible collusion between Russia and Trump campaign.ìMy White House will do whatever the senators want,î Trump affirmed. ìThe one thing I want is speed.îAsked if he would object to the FBI interviewing accuser Julie Swetnick, who is represented by TV attorney and 2020 Democrat hopeful Michael Avenatti, the president replied, ìIt wouldnít bother me at all. Now, I donít know all three of the accusers. Certainly, I imagine theyíre going to interview two. The third one I donít know much about.î

Bob Menendez (D-NJ) are in a statistical dead heat, according to a Stockton University poll released on Monday.The Stockon survey found that Menendez leads against Hugin by two pointsó45 to 43 percentóonly five weeks before the November midterm election. Libertarian candidate Murray Sabrin has three percent support. The poll has a 4.25 percent margin of error, making this is a dead tie between Hugin and Menendez.Menendez, who was reprimanded†by a Senate ethics panel after corruption charges were dismissed following a mistrial, has a net 24 percent unfavorability rating. Hugin, in contrast, has a 13 percent net favorability rating, though 43 percent of New Jerseyans said they were not familiar with him.Michael Klein, the executive director of the Stockon University center for polling, said in a statement on Monday, ìWith a two-point lead falling within the pollís margin of error, the Senate race at this point is up for grabs.îìBob Hugin has been attacking Senator Menendez on ethics with a heavy advertising campaign. However, with so many voters still unfamiliar with the Republican, Menendez will likely try to define his challenger in negative terms,î Klein added.Fifty-nine percent of voters say that the corruption charges against Menendez play an extremely important or a significant factor in their vote for the U.S. Senate race. Eighty-eight percent of Republicans support Hugin, while only 80 percent of Democrats support the incumbent Democrat senator. Independents support Hugin over Menendez by a four-to-three margin.New Jersey has traditionally†served as a deep blue state; the last time New Jersey elected a Republican to the Senate was when they chose Clifford Case in 1972, 46 years ago.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/maxine-waters-demands-kavanaugh-disclose-any-treatment-for-alcohol-abuse/,"As the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) probes decades-old allegations of sexual misconduct against†Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh,†Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) is calling on investigators to look into whether the judge ever sought treatment for alcohol abuse.ìKavanaugh, so many have come forward describing your abuse of alcohol,î Waters tweeted on Sunday. ìI think it is important that the American people know if you have ever sought treatment for alcohol abuse.îKavanaugh, so many have come forward describing your abuse of alcohol. I think it is important that the American people know if you have ever sought treatment for alcohol abuse.ó Maxine Waters (@RepMaxineWaters) September 30, 2018Earlier Sunday morning, the longtime California Democrat claimed Kavanaugh was a ìpuppetî of President Donald Trump, who, alluding to his passionate testimony†before the Senate Judiciary†Committee last Thursday, demonstrated a ìlack of respect for others.îìArenít Supreme Court justices supposed to be independent, and are they not expected to demonstrate the proper judicial temperament?î Waters then asked her nearly 865,000 followers.Kavanaugh has proven that he is a puppet of Donald Trump. He got his marching orders and he promptly displayed Trump's lack of respect for others. Aren't Supreme Court justices supposed to be independent, and are they not expected to demonstrate the proper judicial temperament?ó Maxine Waters (@RepMaxineWaters) September 30, 2018In an interview with†MSNBCís†AM Joy, Waters reiterated her opposition to Kavanaughís confirmation, once against describing the judge as President Trumpís ìpuppet.îìWe have to fight. We have to not only fight to make sure that women get the respect that they deserve, but when you have a credible person like Christine Blasey Ford, it helps us to point out that no matter how credible they are, no matter you how well spoken they are, no matter how smart they are, that these senators do not intend to allow sexual harassment to be the reason why someone will not be confirmed,î Waters said in her usual defiant tone. ìAnd so I think that this has played out in a way that will only strengthen us and strengthen women and those who care about justice to fight and to confront them and protest against what weíre seeing.îWatersí comments come as the media continues to whip itself into a frenzy over Kavanaughís drinking habits, tracking down individuals who claim to know details concerning Supreme Court nomineeís hard-partying ways in college.According to The Washington Post, its reporters tracked down two individuals claiming to be familiar with Kavanaughís college years and say†the nomineeís†denial†of†heavy drinking in an interview with Fox News are inaccurate.ìBrett was a sloppy drunk, and I know because I drank with him. I watched him drink more than a lot of people. Heíd end up slurring his words, stumbling,î Swisher, who says she was friends with Kavanaugh during college, told the Post.†ìThereís no medical way I can say that he was blacked out. . . . But itís not credible for him to say that he has had no memory lapses in the nights that he drank to excess.îSwisherís College roommate,†Lynne Brookes, accused Kavanaugh of attempting to ìpaint himself as some kind of choir boy.î ìYou canít lie your way onto the Supreme Court, and with that statement out, heís gone too far. Itís about the integrity of that institution,î she told the paper.In an interview with Fox News last Monday, Kavanaugh denied all allegations of sexual misconduct and pushed back on claims that he was frequently†inebriated†at parties thrown during his high school and college years.ì[Y]es, there were parties.†And the drinking age was 18, and yes, the seniors were legal and had beer there,î the Supreme Court nominee told host Martha†MacCallum. ìAnd yes, people might have had too many beers on occasion and people generally in high school ñ I think all of us have probably done things we look back on in high school and regret or cringe a bit, but thatís not what weíre talking about.îIn an opinion-editorial published by Slate last Tuesday, William Saletan argues the culture at Kavanaughís high school ó Georgetown Preparatory School ó paired with accusations brought forth by†Christine Blasey†Ford and Debra Ramirez ó justify an FBI investigation into the Judgeís alleged drinking habits.Saletan writes:On Thursday, Kavanaugh faces a Senate hearing about Fordís allegations. He will try to draw a line. At a rehearsal with White House aides last week, he ìgrew frustratedî with questions about his drinking and his sexual behavior, according to the Washington Post. ìIím not going to answer that,î he said. Judge doesnít want to answer questions either. The Republicans who control the committee are planning to†leave Judge out†of the hearing.Thatís unacceptable. The alcohol theory is arguably the most plausible explanation of what happened. Itís less crazy than Ford inventing a story and putting herself through hell so Trump can nominate a different conservative judge to the Supreme Court.ÖIf the committee wonít delegate this job to the FBI, senators must do it themselves. Ask Judge and Kavanaugh about their history with alcohol. Talk to the people who drank with them or saw them drunk. If you think alcohol could have corrupted Fordís memory or Ramirezís memory, ask about their drinking too. This is an investigative avenue with a strong evidentiary basis and many potential witnesses, and it puts everyoneís denials in doubt. To confirm Kavanaugh without checking it out would be a betrayal of justice.Of course, the consumption of alcohol has not been a federal offense since the end of Prohibition in 1933.Some who knew Kavanagh during his high school days have pushed back against claims that the now-Judge drank too much.ìDrinking was prevalent in high school, but some guys handled it better than others, and Brett always maintained his composure,î Tom Kane, described as†a ìclose friendî of†Kavanaugh, told the Post. ìHe was not a stumbling drunk. He was never all that interested in getting wasted.îFormer NBA player Chris Dudley†and former college classmate of Kanavaugh†said the Trump pick is the target of an all-out smear campaign.ìI went out with him all the time. He never blacked out. Never even close to blacked out,î Dudley said. ìThere was drinking, and there was alcohol. Brett drank, and I drank. Did he get inebriated sometimes? Yes. Did I? Yes. Just like every other college kid in America.î

Mazie Hirono (D-HI) said the expanded FBI investigation into Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh should include whether Kavanaugh was ìa very belligerent, aggressive drunkî in his youth.Hirono said, ìAs most normal people would think, that whether or not Judge Kavanaugh lied to the committee, which should be a total nonstarter for anybody wanting to go to the Supreme Court, is not even the area of focus. Itís so limited, I called it basicallyóI think the word farce would not be far off to talk about this so-called investigation. It is not going to get us anywhere near the truth. But the other thing that I found totally bizarre and astounding was when Judge Kavanaugh accused the Democrats of engaging in a plot to do him in, and he dragged in Hillary Clinton and all that. This is a conspiracy theory. This is what he believes. This is what heís going to take to the Supreme Court. And he also was so partisan that it was unbelievable. He even wrote a law review article in 2016 where he said a judge should be totally nonpartisan. Thatís not what was shown to us.îShe continued, ìThere were inconsistencies about his drinking and information we have from various of his classmates, that he was a very belligerent, aggressive drunk. So I would like the FBI to go and interview all of these people, and we have to draw our conclusions, but it was unbelievable, the portrayal of himself as some kind of a boy scout, all he cared about was studying, going to church, doing projects and playing basketball or sports. It was pretty unbelievable to me. And very clearly, when he was asked specific questions about the meaning of the terms in his yearbook, what the meanings of those words were. And as Comey said, when you lie about something like that, it just points to the need to dig deeper.îShe added, ìI think thereís a pattern of him not being candid with the committee, it goes back to his nomination hearings in 2006.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/prosecutor-christine-blasey-ford-doesnt-know-if-polygraph-was-on-day-of-grandmothers-funeral/,"The final Senate report from Rachel Mitchell, the sex crimes prosecutor who interviewed Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser Christine Blasey Ford, questions Blasey Fordís ìstruggle to recall important recent eventsî such as whether she took her polygraph test the same day as her grandmotherís funeral.Appearing before the†Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday, Blasey Ford ó the California professor who brought forth an allegation of teenage sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh, President Trumpís Supreme Court nominee ó said she did not know whether her polygraph examination less than two months ago occurred on the same day her grandmother was buried. This discrepancy is listed among nine categories of strikes against Blasey Fordís testimony which led Mitchell to conclude her account did not meet the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.When asked why†Jerry Hanafin,†the polygraph administrator, conducted the examination at a hotel near the BaltimoreñWashington International Airport, instead of his†Virginia office, Ford revealed time constraints left her unable to travel far for the test.ìI had left my grandmotherís funeral at that point at Fort Lincoln Cemetery that day and I was on a tight scheduled to get to make a plane to Manchester, New Hampshire,î the 51-year-old professor told Mitchell. ìHe was willing to come to me, which was appreciated.îìSo you were administered a polygraph on the day that you attended your grandmotherís funeral?î Mitchell asked.ìCorrect, or it might have been the next day,î Ford responded.She then turned to her†attorney, Debra Katz, and said she did not remember the exact day the test was taken.ìDr. Ford could not remember if she was being audio- or video-recorded when she took the polygraph,î†the memo reads. ìAnd she could not remember whether the polygraph occurred†the same day as her grandmotherís funeral or the day after her grandmotherís funeral.îAccording to Mitchell, administering a polygraph to an individual who is ìgrievingî is ìinappropriate.îAs Breitbart News has previously reported, Blasey Ford was only asked two broad questions during her polygraph exam: ìIs any part of your statement false?î and ìDid you make up any part of your statement?îìFord was not asked any specific questions about the specific allegation,î Breitbartís John Nolte pointed out ó no questions to name Kavanaugh as her attacker or about the details of her story. ìThere are also no test or baseline questions where the subject is intentionally asked to lie.îThe memoís release comes after the White House ordered the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to launch a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, a request made by Jeff Flake (R-AZ) moments before the committee was slated to vote that Kavanaughís confirmation be sent to the full Senate for a vote.îI think it would be proper to delay the floor vote for up to but not more than one week in order to let the FBI do an investigation, limited in time and scope to the current allegations that are there, limited in time to no more than one week,î Flake said. ìAnd I will vote to advance the bill to the floor with that understanding.îWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders would†announce†hours later that†President Donald Trump would accommodate the request and asked the FBI to probe the claims.†ìIíve ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaughís file,î President Trump said†in a statement. ìAs the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week.îIn a separate†statement released through the White House, Kavanaugh said he stood ready to cooperate in the investigation.†ìThroughout this process, Iíve been interviewed by the FBI, Iíve done a number of ëbackgroundí calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me,î said Kavanaugh. ìIíve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate.î

They should interview, but they should also be guided, and Iím being guided, by what the senators are looking for.îAlexander then asked if Kavanaugh should be interviewed by the FBI.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/10/01/christine-blasey-ford-not-credible-prosecutor-mitchell-senate-report/,"Rachel Mitchell, the veteran sex crimes prosecutor chosen by Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to question Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh, has filed a report that points out Fordís inconsistencies and apparent deceptions.ìIn the legal context, here is my bottom line,î she writes. ìA ëhe said, she saidí case is incredibly difficult to prove. But this case is even weaker than that. I do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence.îShe adds, ìNor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.î This means Fordís story does not reach the 50-50 level of being more likely to have occurred than not.Read the full report:Mitchell Memo by on Scribd<U+FEFF>On Sunday, Breitbart News published an extensive list of Fordís inconsistencies, including the fact she told the Committee she is afraid to fly when the truth is that she flies frequently for both business and pleasure. Mitchellís report is even more comprehensive, with nine different general objections (marked with underlined text) substantiated by dozens of contradicting claims and unanswered questions.Fordís deviations in her timeline about when the assault occurred are important. Did the event occur in the ìmid-eightiesî or ìearly-eighties,î was she in her ìearly teensî or ìlate teens,î and why did she cross out the ìearlyî in ìearly 80sî in the statement for her polygraph report?Mitchell lays it all out:Fordís timeline of the trauma she claims the event left her raises questions:This is relevant because her final two years of high school were the two years immediately after the event.Mitchell moves on to lay out how Fordís version of what happened has been every bit the moving target as the timing of the event. ìWhen speaking with her husband,î Mitchell writes, ìDr. Ford changed her description of the incident to become less specific.îNow it is an attempted sexual assault.Mitchell explains that Fordís ìinability to rememberî where the house where the event took place ìraises significant questions.î As does her inability to remember how she ìgot from the party back to her house.îIn other words, how did Ford get home? She had no cell phone. She testified that she did not call anyone to pick her up while she was in the house. She testified that she ran out of the house without telling anyone, so no one in the house gave her a ride home. How did she arrange a ride home?Mitchell moves on to Fordís ìaccount of the alleged assault,î and how she ìhas not offered a consistent account[.]îIn the Feinstein letter, though, Ford makes it sound as though hearing the conversation downstairs was her signal that it was safe for her to leave the bathroom.Mitchell then points out the glaring inconsistencies in Fordís account of who and how many people attended the 1982 house party.Why would Ford fail to note in her polygrapher statement that her best friend Leland Keyser was at the party, a woman who is still a lifelong friend.Despite their friendship. Keyser maintains (under penalty of a felony) she has no memory of this house party and that she has never even met Kavanaugh.Mitchell also focused on Fordís memory of recent events.Ford claims she cannot even remember crucial events around her polygraph test, which she took in August, less than 60 days prior to her Committee testimony:Mitchell adds that ìIt would also have been inappropriate to administer a polygraph to someone who was grieving.îMitchell reminds the Committee that ìDr. Ford refused to provide any of her therapy notes toî them, which means we will never know the truth of anything, not only because Ford will not provide the notes, but because she claims she cannot recall if she showed the Post the actual therapist notes or her version of them.Mitchell lays out Fordís comments about her claim she is afraid of flying, a fear that delayed everything for a full week.Mitchell goes on to not only lay out the facts that again point to a delaying tactic, but undercut Fordís claim she wished to remain anonymous:Elsewhere in her report, Mitchell points out the inconsistencies in Fordís repeated claim she wished to remain anonymous and would have preferred a private interview:Fordís team turning down the Committeeís offer to have her give testimony privately, at her home in California, also delayed things.Finally there is the issue of Fordís three ìwitnesses,î all of whom refute her account.Before attaching a detailed timeline, Mitchell concludes with, ìThe activities of congressional Democrats and Dr. Fordís attorneys likely affected Dr. Fordís account.î†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

You have to now prove the allegations by clear and convincing evidence with due process.îDershowitz went on to argue that liberals have already presumed Kavanaugh guilty because he is a white man and Ford is a female survivor, adding ìall the rules are called offî when it involves a white man being accused.ìWe know he is guilty because he is a white man, sheís a woman, sheís a survivor.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/30/pollak-brett-kavanaughs-temperament-righteous-indignation-in-the-face-of-injustice/,"The Democrats and the media, having attacked Judge Brett Kavanaugh with accusations that he claims are false and that they cannot prove, now say he has disqualified himself from the Supreme Court because of his ìtemperamentî and partisanship.In fact, Kavanaughís temperament is perfect. We do not want judges who express indifference to injustice. On the contrary, we want judges who show righteous indignation in the face of injustice, and who apply legal principles to the defense of liberty.The left is perfectly capable of defending anger and outrage when deployed in service of its own ends. On Friday, when two women trapped Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) in an elevator, holding the door so that he could not leave, the left and the media celebrated.Few bothered to note that one of them,†Ana Maria Archila, is a professional left-wing activist who runs a George Soros-funded organization, and she had never told anyone that she had been sexually assaulted until she told Flake. Her outrage was accepted immediately as an authentic†crie de coeur, and she was interviewed by countless media outlets.No, Archila is not being considered for the Supreme Court. But she is also not facing a slew of sudden, sordid, unproven and unprovable accusations that would not only stop her from obtaining the job she seeks, but also remove her from every job she currently holds. That ought to put Kavanaughís outrage in perspective.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said Saturday that she would seek to remove the otherwise soft-spoken Kavanaugh from the D.C. Circuit if Democrats re-take the House in November, and left-wing Harvard Law School students are asking the university to reconsider his teaching appointment. USA Today even suggested ó before backing down ó that he avoid children playing sports until he is confirmed.Democrats have sought to destroy his life and his name, forever.†That is excessive and unjust, given the weakness of the accusations against him and his evident belief that he is telling the truth.In that light, Kavanaughís response was not only justifiable, but arguably mild. Few human beings could withstand what he has been through, and even though he stands to be confirmed to a lifetime post, the idea that Supreme Court justices must qualify by tolerating sordid inquiries into their personal lives as minors is absurd.In his†Letter from a Birmingham Jail, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. explained: ìThere comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair.î Democrats, and the media, expected Kavanaugh would withdraw in despair once confronted by a life-changing accusation, however weak.He refused, defending his name and principles, especially that the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty ó a principle the left pretended, until recently, to share.Those who forced him to do so now fear Kavanaugh may seek revenge from the bench, if confirmed. He will not ó he is better than that, and them ó but they only have themselves to blame.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/09/30/james-comey-in-nyt-op-ed-fbi-can-save-america-from-kavanaugh/,"Fired FBI director James Comey has once again returned to the spotlight, this time in the form of an op-ed published the New York Times†where Comey argues that the FBI will have no problem investigating decades-old allegations against Brett Kavanaugh in the next week.In the opinion piece, titled, ìJames Comey: The F.B.I. Can Do This,î Comey urges Americans to put their trust in the FBI as they seek to investigate uncorroborated sexual misconduct claims against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.ìPresident Trumpís decision to order a one-week investigation into sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, his Supreme Court nominee, comes in a time of almost indescribable pain and anger, lies and attacks,î Comey writes.He continues by listing his grievances against President Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, then blaming Republican voters for not sharing his opinions on the two men.We live in a world where the president routinely attacks the F.B.I. because he fears its work. He calls for his enemies to be prosecuted and his friends freed. We also live in a world where a sitting federal judge channels the president by shouting attacks at the Senate committee considering his nomination and demanding to know if a respected senator has ever passed out from drinking. We live in a world where the president is an accused serial abuser of women, who was caught on tape bragging about his ability to assault women and now likens the accusations against his nominee to the many ìfalseî accusations against him.Most disturbingly, we live in a world where millions of Republicans and their representatives think nearly everything in the previous paragraph is O.K.Comey, who has attempted to make himself into a nonpartisan hero, is now attacking Republican voters for not being sufficiently bothered by Kavanaugh ìshouting attacks at the Senate committee,î never mind the fact that he just had to endure a week of utter hell as his name and reputation was destroyed, he was relentlessly smeared in the media, and his family received violent messages and threats.No, the real victim here is the poor members of the Senate, because Kavanaugh occasionally raised his voice to protest the vile attacks against him.The fired FBI directorís real point in penning this article, however, is to assure the liberal readership of the Times†that if nothing else has stopped Kavanaughís confirmation, the FBI can.Comey is literally bragging about how the FBI has the power to do the Democratsí dirty work for them and stop Kavanaughís confirmation.ìAlthough the process is deeply flawed, and apparently designed to thwart the fact-gathering process, the F.B.I. is up for this. Itís not as hard as Republicans hope it will be.îComey then brags about the FBIís power, writing that it can ìspeak to scores of people in a few days,î ìconfront people with testimony and other accounts,î and ì[test] them and [push] them in a professional way.îìYes, the alleged incident occurred 36 years ago. But F.B.I. agents know time has very little to do with memory,î Comey writes, citing the fact that people always remember how the weather is on their wedding day, seemingly comparing getting married to attending a drunken teenage party.Comey then writes that FBI agents know that ìlittle lies point to bigger liesî and then accuses Kavanaugh of ìobvious liesÖabout the meaning of words in a yearbook.îIn the final paragraph, Comey concludes the op-ed with a barely veiled warning.Once they start interviewing, every witness knows the consequences. It is one thing to have your lawyer submit a statement on your behalf. It is a very different thing to sit across from two F.B.I. special agents and answer their relentless questions. Of course, the bureau wonít have subpoena power, only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions. But most people will speak to them. Refusal to do so is its own kind of statement.There are a number of reasons why someone approached by the FBI wouldnít want to submit to, as Comey himself says, ìrelentlessî questioning. Chief among them would be the fact that many people honestly do not remember what occurred 36 years ago and donít want to talk to FBI agents about their hazy memories of high school parties that occurred over three decades ago.But itís impossible to read what Comey wrote and not think that thereís a more sinister implicationñif you donít want to talk to the FBI, maybe you have something to hide.We are now in full-on totalitarian ìnothing to hide, nothing to fearî territory. The left will clearly stop at nothing to destroy Kavanaughñletís hope their dirty tactics donít work.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/09/30/nolte-fox-news-cowards-spread-fake-news-christine-blasey-ford-credible/,"On Thursday, Judge Andrew Napolitano handed the mob all the rope they could possibly ask for, courtesy of Fox News, saying,†ìAll of us agree that this witness is exceptionally credible.îNo one argued with him.Listen, I am not here to signal my own virtue. I am not David French, or Matthew Dowd, or Jake Tapper. The reason I have defended those whose politics and character disgust me has nothing to do with virtue and everything to do with self-preservation.I have never liked Roy Moore; I have still defended him. Charlie Sheenís mug shot should be pasted next to ìdegenerateî in the dictionary; I have still defended him. Woody Allen, George Takei, and Bryan Singer are moral and political illiterates; I have still defended them. And in the specific cases of Allen, Moore, and Singer, vigorously and in great detail.You know whatóI was wrong. Let me back up a bit.Itís actually not about self-preservation, at least not anymore.Maybe it was at first, maybe it was a hundred years ago, before ìThe Wokeî fascists who have captured our culture and media began slapping scarlet letters on free thinkers; before we became a country where panel after panel on MSNBC and CNN would condemn Atticus Finch for not believing the woman, before Twitter and Facebook would ìunpersonî Winston Smith over a joke.Maybe a hundred years ago I believed that if I didnít join the mob, I would be safe when the mob came for me, because I could say to the mob, ìHey, Iím not a part of this. I said Brian Williams deserved a second chance. Iíve never called on anyone to be fired. I oppose boycotts. Iíve defended you and you and even you.îHow so very naiveÖ.Nope. it is no longer about self-preservation. And again, it not about virtue or principle or pride. It is now only about thing: when the mob comes for me, at the very least, I can comfort myself in the knowledge I am not reaping what I sowed.And thatís why I waited a week before making any kind of comment about the allegations Christine Blasey Ford leveled against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, and thatís why I listened to her full testimony before commenting on thatówhich brings me to Fox News.Watch this crapÖNo, noÖ Wait. Before you watch that crap, let me set the sceneÖThe Fox News clip below is from Thursdayónot Thursday evening after both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh had their full say, not even Thursday afternoon after Dr. Ford completed her full testimony. No, this is the very first break in her testimony, early in her testimony, very early in her testimony, a mere 15 minutes into her testimonyÖAnd what is on the line here? Forget about the politics or the future of the Supreme Court. Ö Forget about all of that, because there is something much bigger at stake here: a man, an individualóhis name, his reputation, his future, his place in history, his guilt or his innocence, and the way his own children will remember him.There is no smaller or more vulnerable minority than The Individual, and in a decent country populated with decent people, nothing should be more important than that; than the right of that one man or that one woman to enjoy, among other things, the presumption of innocence until proven otherwiseómost especially in the court of public opinion.And with all that in mindÖWatch this crap:Your ears are not lying to you. A mere 15 minutes into an all-day event, Chris Wallace, a man who poses as a journalist, the man who hosts one of the oh-so venerated Sunday shows, actually said:[Fordís testimony] is extremely emotional, extremely raw, and extremely credible. No could listen to her deliver those words and talk about the assault and the impact it had had on her life and not have your heart go out to her. Ö This is a disaster for the Republicans.Later, Woke Wallace dropped this non sequitur of a virtue signal:Over the course of this week,†like I think a lot of American families,†my family <U+2015> a lot of it on email <U+2015> has been discussing this and disagreeing and arguing about it. And two of my daughters have told me stories that I had never heard before about things that happened to them in high school.Later that same afternoon on NPR CNN MSNBC Fox News:Judge Andrew Napolitano†said, ìI think Dr. Ford is exceptionally credible.îWay to judge, Judge.Karl Rove described Ford as ìcredible,î without any pushback.We expect this kind of shrill, thoughtless, dive bombing from a CNN or MSNBC. In fact, were I to turn on either of those networks to find anything close to moral decency, I wouldnít know what to do with myself. But here is Fox NewsóFox FREAKINí Newsófashionably proclaiming uncorroborated and unsubstantiated testimony from a woman accusing a fellow human being of an attempted sexual assaultónot just as credible, but as ìextremely credibleî and ìexceptionally credible.îAnd again, forget the politics, and think only of this: for just a moment pretend you are this man, a man with a wife, parents, friends, daughtersóand without a shred of evidence, without even having heard all of her testimony, without having heard the rebuttal testimony, Fox News is telling them the sexual assault allegations against you are ìextremely credible.îThis is monstrous behavior, unforgivable, un-Americanóthe stuff of lynch mobs, of quislingsóand it is the fakest of fake news.By any standard of truth, fairness, classical liberalism, evidence, and facts, Dr. Ford is not only not credible, she is nothing close to credible.Let me count the waysÖDr. Fordís allegations are not only not credible ó they are ludicrous, a jokeÖEven what she does remember is so full of holes you could bounce Brian Stelter through it:No one who believes in truth can declare this nonsense credible. But beyond that, where is the instinct of human decency that makes it impossible to cruelly and publicly smear a man as having ìcredibleî sexual assault allegation leveled against him when those allegations are the very definition of horse shit.For Godís sake, what are these Fox News cowards basing the words ìcredibleî on? On something as unreliable as presentation and performanceÖ How many witnesses against the wrongly accused are credible? How about we flip the script and remember that Bill Cosbyís credible presentation and performance as Americaís Dad allowed him to serial rape for 50 years.Or does Fox News actually know just how un-credible Dr. Ford is, but rather than fight for truth, for The Individual, they prefer to surrender to the mob because thatís easier, safer, less stressful, and what you are supposed to do. A manís life and career and name and reputation are on the line, his accusers actions and accusations are, by any standard, equal parts deceptive, dishonest, and implausibleÖ And there was Fox News spreading the fake news that 2 + 2 = 5.P.S.

We routinely in America have trials that are determined based on testimonial evidence under oath. Her testimony is evidence. In addition, there is a lot of things that corroborate her testimony. Mark Judge is a friend of Brett Kavanaugh, and they both drink a lot, they were both in the same area and had social gatherings where they interacted. There are a lot of corroborations. She mentioned it also in 2012 and 2013. She is not a left-wing Clinton conspiracy so for Brett Kavanaugh brought that up shows why he is unfit for the court.îHe added, ìYou have to watch his testimony in front of the U.S. Senate to know that he is very partisan. Beyond that, he believes in conspiracy theories. That is a problem. When you see Dr. Fordís testimony, itís very clear she is not part of some vast left-wing conspiracy. She was assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh. She told people in 2012 and 2013 and for him to think she is part of a conspiracy makes me question what kind of impartiality he can show on the U.S. Supreme Court.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/30/tom-cotton-dems-turned-advice-and-consent-into-search-and-destroy/,"Sunday on CBSís ìFace The Nation,î Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) echoed Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaughís words and said Democrats behavior through the confirmation process for Kavanaugh was a ìsearch and destroy mission.îPartial transcript as follows:JOHN DICKERSON: We are joined now by Arkansas Republican Senator Tom Cotton. Welcome Senator. After watching the hearings- you were a supporter of Brett Kavanaughís, how did you process the new information that came out in the hearings?SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well John, first off, letís understand what we had to have this hearing. Miss Ford made these allegations in a confidential letter to Dianne Feinstein in July, shortly after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated. The very night he was nominated, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said that he would do everything in his power to stop the nomination. And thatís what happened. For three months, the Democrats have turned the advise and consent process into a search and destroy mission. These allegations are completely unsupported by any evidence. What evidence there is to a 36 year old claim, all support Judge Kavanaughís denial. But the- the Democrats have disgraced this process and the United States Senate in the orchestrated smear campaign of character assassination theyíve run against Judge Kavanaugh.DICKERSON: Their argument of course, was that Dr. Ford asked to have this held in confidentiality and that they tried to do that. And thatís what it wasñCOTTON: So- so let meDICKERSON: But I- I actuallyñCOTTON: †No no no no no. No, John let me talk to you about that. Let me talk to your listeners about- or your viewers about that. There is a well established process of confidentiality on the committee. Dianne Feinstein could have showed that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them, as the leaders of that committee could have shared it with the FBI who could have discreetly conducted this inquiry in July and in August without betraying Miss Fordís confidences. And they have betrayed her. They pointed her to lawyers who lied to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her. All that- now all of that is water under the bridge. Those lawyers are going to face a D.C. bar investigation into their misconduct. Dianne Feinstein and her staff is going to face an investigation for why they leaked that. All of this could have been done discreetly it happens hundreds of tim- hundreds of times every year in the Judiciary Committee.DICKERSON: It doesnít happen- it doesnít happen hundreds of times with- with issues that are this sensitive but letísñCOTTON: No, John it doesñDICKERSON: SenatorñCOTTON: ñitís designed for issues that are sensitive John.DICKERSON: Senator Iím worriedñCOTTON: Itís designed for issues like this.DICKERSON: youíre not going to get a chance to talk about Miss Fordís testimony and Mr. Kavanaghís testimony. You watched it I assume, what was your- what was your take away from that?COTTON: Judge Kavanaugh hundred percent denied these allegations. There is not a single bit of corroborating evidence. Every evidence that we do have to include the people that Miss Ford herself named either donít recall this incident or they deny that it happened.DICKERSON: Did you find Miss†Ford.- Dr. Ford credible?COTTON: Miss Ford was sympathetic and she was sincere. She has been victimized by the Democrats in this process, John. They betrayed her own requests for confidentiality. They leaked this to the media at the last minute because they are on a search and destroy mission for Brett Kavanaugh.DICKERSON: You said when we last talked in November, ìI think itís important that women feel they can come forward. Thatís a good change in the norms and the expectations of our society.î A woman came forward here. And youíre saying basically she said nothing credible. How can women come forward, if when they do theyíre- theyíre told theyíre not credible?COTTON: She came forward confidentially to Dianne Feinstein. Dianne Feinstein did not share that with the proper authorities. Chuck Grassley, her counterpart, with whom she served for decades in the SenateñDICKERSON: ñI understand thatñCOTTON: ñand the FBI that could have reviewed these matter confidential- confidentially. Then they leaked it to the mediañDICKERSON: ñalright, but SenatorñCOTTON: ñcreating- creating the circus environment youíve seen for the last two years.DICKERSON: So that a woman thing about coming forward will have it immediately turned into a partisan issue, as youíve done it, her- her issues are not being discussed by you. You havenít discussed them since youíve been here. Why would a- would a person want to come forward if immediately the response is to get ground up in this partisan thing? Youíre blaming it on the Democrats, fine. But sheís still a human being who has come forward. How should she beñCOTTON: ñJohnñDICKERSON: ñHow do you process what she said?COTTON: John, any impact that this entire episode has had on womenís willingness to come forward and report sexual assault, which I encourage them all to do immediately after it happens, is caused by the Democrats, is caused by Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer not respecting her requests for confidentiality. Now, when you come forward with an accusation as serious as this it has to be tested against the evidence and against proof and we would have known that confidentially inside the Judiciary Committee in AugustñDICKERSON: ñis the FBI wasting its time investigating?COTTON: I donít know what- I donít know what the FBI is going to find that the committee has not already found. That- the committee staff has already interviewed all the witnesses that Ms. Ford cited. They interviewed Ms. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh for six hoursñDICKERSON: ñwell, they havenít interviewedñCOTTON: ñon Thursday.ñDICKERSON: ñMr. Judge. He sent them a letter. That wasnít an interview.COTTON: Butñ butñDICKERSON: ñSo youíre not right about that.COTTON: So theyíve either interviewed them or theyíve received lettersñDICKERSON: ñwell, thatís different.ñCOTTON: ñletters under penalty of perjury. I- IñDICKERSON: ñWell, but thatís different. Now, these are actual interviews.COTTON: So Iíd be surprised if any of these people under penalty of perjury change their statements that theyíve already given to judiciary committee.DICKERSON: Well, surprise, but thatís why we have investigations. Wrestle stuff to the ground, have a neutral fact pattern. Clearly the members of the Committee on the Republican side want Kavanaugh to be confirmed. So why should people who want him to be confirmed be in charge of an investigation? Why not have neutral observers wrestle the facts to the ground, which is whatís happening now? So itís not a waste of time.COTTON: John. We already know what everyone who is alleged to be at the party has said. Theyíve submitted statements or been interviewed under penalty of perjury. I would be shocked if any of them change their statement under penalty of perjury to the FBI. But if this makes a few senators more comfortable about going forward and voting on Judge Kavanaughís very highly qualified nomination in-in the face of an orchestrated Democratic smear campaign, thenñDICKERSON: ó Was he óCOTTON: †ó That may end up as a good thing.DICKERSON: Was Judge Kavanaugh truthful in everything he said in his testimony?COTTON: I found him to be truthful throughout his testimony. I found him to beñDICKERSON: ó What if it turns out he-he wasnít óCOTTON: I found him to be appropriately indignantñDICKERSON: ó sure óCOTTON: -At the smear campaign. And I-Iím disappointed in what Chris Coons said on that video leading in. It reminds me of the old proverb, ìThis animal is very wicked. It defends itself when attackedñîDICKERSON: ó Yeah óCOTTON: If they didnít want him to come in-come in and be angry and indignant at their false accusations, they should have thought about that before they accused him of being a serial sex criminal for the last two weeksñDICKERSON: Let me ask you this. If it turns out that he was not truthful about something that has nothing to do with what allegedly happened thirty six years ago, truthfulness is still something you want in a Supreme Court nominee though, is that relevant?COTTON: What-what are you talking about John?DICKERSON: But if it turns out in the course of the FBI investigationñCOTTON: ó So óDICKERSON: If his-if his assertionsóCOTTON: ó So are you siding with the Democrats and now want to have an open ended fishing expedition?DICKERSON: I think thatís not fair, Senator.COTTON: ó What are you talking about? óDICKERSON: Iím asking you if in the investigation it turns out that something outside of that is- if his testimony turns out to not beñCOTTON: Well look, as John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham said, if thereís some shocking new bit of, not accusation, but evidence and proof, then of course Iím open to evaluating that evidence but I said I strongly suspect that every statement that was made to the Judiciary Committee under penalty of perjury is the exact same statement thatís going to be made to the FBI.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/30/maxine-waters-kavanaugh-should-not-be-confirmed-he-is-trumps-puppet/,"Sunday on†MSNBCís ìAM Joy,î†Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) said Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaughës testimony before the Judiciary Committee showed he was ìnothing but a tool and a puppet to the president United States of America.îWaters said, ìWe have to fight. We have to not only fight to make sure that women get the respect that they deserve, but when you have a credible person like Christine Blasey Ford, it helps us to point out that no matter how credible they are, no matter you how well spoken they are, no matter how smart they are, that these senators do not intend to allow sexual harassment to be the reason why someone will not be confirmed. And so I think that this has played out in a way that will only strengthen us and strengthen women and those who care about justice to fight and to confront them and protest against what weíre seeing.îShe continued, ìKavanaugh is very interesting. I think one of the most serious things that we have learned about him is he is trying to be confirmed to the highest court in the land, but he is not an independent. What he did is he went back up to the White House, and the president told him what goes back and say and how to act. So if he is nothing but a tool and a puppet to the president United States of America, why would we want him on the highest court of the land. It doesnít bode well for America.She added, ìIt sounded as if it was coming straight out of Trumpís mouth, so he had his orders. And he came back, and he did exactly what he was told to do. I think that is a serious problem with anybody who is wishing to be confirmed to the highest court of the land. He cannot be trusted. And if he is nothing but a mouthpiece for Trump, we know what that means for democracy. We know what that means for a lack of justice that is going to come out of the Supreme Court by someone like him. It is outrageous that he would allow himself to basically take those kind of orders and come back and execute them. Everybody could recognize what that was all about. And the difference between even how he first comported himself and after he had gone to the White House, it is so obvious that he is not independent and will never be independent. To bring politics into it and to talk about Hillary Clinton and the Democrats? No Supreme Court justice should act that way. He cannot be trusted, and he should not be confirmed.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

If heís on the Supreme Court and the Senate hasnít investigated, the House will have to.îHe added, ìWe would have to investigate any credible allegations of perjury and other things not properly looked into before.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter†@pamkeyNEN

ìChristine Blasey Ford demonstrated a huge amount of courage speaking out this week,î the campaignís statement reads. ìShe did not initially come forward because she was scared of the response. She was right to be scared.î
ìNot only has the right wing smear machine started, but she is receiving serious threats against her and has had to engage a security force to protect her family,î it continues. ìThis is all really expensive and she needs our help. We need to protect the voices of brave people who speak out ñ especially when they are part of our community.îAlthough the campaign is no longer accepting donations, the fundraising effort smashed its $150,000 target by raising $528,315 from roughly 11,500 people in under two weeks.ìA statement of gratitude from the family will be forthcoming in the next 48 hours with a fuller explanation, but in the meantime, do keep your comments coming. I am sharing them with her.îLesh is known to be politically active. Earlier this month, the Grateful Dead singer performed at a fundraising concert for HeadCount, a non-profit organization which aims to push voter registration and turnout among minorities.In February, Lesh also appeared†at a candlelight vigil in California for victims of the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, alongside other gun control campaigners.ìIím feeling such rage right now, such anguish and grief thinking about these brave spirits cut off before their time,î the Grateful Dead singer said at the time.†ìWe cannot allow this.

Anyone who could confirm the salacious meaning, Rose wrote in an email obtained by the Washington Examiner, should contact Debra Katz, the lawyer of one of Kavanaughís accusers.ìDebra Katz needs to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms used by Brett Kavanaugh in his yearbook page meant ñ such as FFFF ñ Devilís Triangle ñ and Renate Alumnus,î Rose wrote. ìIf you can speak to any of these and are willing to sign an affidavit, please contact her at [redacted] and [redacted].îRose did not responded to numerous requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Katz told the Washington Examiner that ìDebra Katz did not know about this email or its contents before Ms. Rose sent it, and did not ask for it to be sent.îThe affidavits were apparently not obtained before last Thursdayís Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, but Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) questioned Kavanaugh about his yearbook, regardless.Democrats are trying to accuse Kavanaugh of perjury after he identified the term ìDevilís Triangleî as a drinking game, and said that the term ìboofingî referred to flatulence.Critics say that ìDevilís Triangleî refers to a sexual threesome between two men and one woman, and ìboofingî refers to anal sex.Former FBI director James Comey referenced those claims in a tweet:Small lies matter, even about yearbooks.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/30/third-brett-kavanaugh-accuser-was-sued-in-2000-for-false-allegations-of-sexual-misconduct/,"Julie Swetnick, the third woman to accuse Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, was sued in 2000 for making false accusations of sexual misconduct against co-workers, and for sexual misconduct of her own, though the case was dismissed.Swetnick issued a statement last Wednesday through her attorney, Michael Avenatti, alleging that Kavanaugh was ìpresentî at gang rapes at high school parties in the early 1980s. She provided no corroborating evidence, and questions immediately arose as to why a string of gang rapes would have been unreported until now, as well as why she would have been going to high school parties during a time when she was in college.Subsequently, reports emerged that she had been accused of making false accusations of sexual misconduct in the past ó and that she herself had been accused of sexually inappropriate behavior in the workplace.The†Oregonian reported:Julie Swetnick, one of the women accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct, faced allegations of her own misconduct during a short stint at a Portland tech company 18 years ago.ÖThe lawsuit was dismissed shortly after it was filed late in 2000, court documents show. In emails to The Oregonian/OregonLive, Avenatti called the allegations against his client, ìCompletely bogus.îÖIn the suit, Webtrends alleged Swetnick claimed to have graduated from Johns Hopkins University but the company said it subsequently learned the school had no record of her attendance. Webtrends said she also ìfalsely described her work experienceî at a prior employer.The suit also alleges Swetnick ìengaged in unwelcome, sexually offensive conductî while at Webtrends and ìmade false and retaliatory allegations that other co-workers had engaged in inappropriate conduct toward her.îThe Daily Caller elaborated:Swetnickís alleged conduct took place in June 2000, just three weeks after she started working at WebTrends, the complaint shows. WebTrends conducted an investigation that found both male employees gave similar accounts of Swetnick engaging in ìunwelcome sexual innuendo and inappropriate conductî toward them during a business lunch in front of customers, the complaint said.Swetnick denied the allegations and, WebTrends alleged, ìin a transparent effort to divert attention from her own inappropriate†behavior Ö [made] false and retaliatory allegationsî of sexual harassment against two other male co-workers.ìBased on its investigations, WebTrends determined that Swetnick had engaged in inappropriate conduct, but that no corroborating evidence existed to support Swetnickís allegations against her coworkers,î the complaint said.After a WebTrends human resources director informed Swetnick that the company was unable to corroborate†the sexual harassment allegations she had made, she ìremarkablyî walked back the allegations, according to the complaint.Politico also reported†last Wednesday that Swetnickís former boyfriend had filed a restraining order against her in 2001, and that he told the publication: ìîSheís not credible at all. Ö Not at all.îAvenatti called Politicoís report ìattacking a sexual assault victim.îAvenatti is also representing porn star Stormy Daniels against President Donald Trump and preparing his own 2020 presidential run, and has predicted that Trump will not finish his first term.Though Swetnickís allegations were greeted with some skepticism, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) cited them during last Thursdayís hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee with Kavanagh and Christine Blasey Ford, who says he groped her in high school.Joel B.

My family and my name have been totally and permanently destroyed . . . This confirmation process has become a national disgrace.îPerhaps most memorably, directing his fury at Senate Democrats, the D.C. Court of Appeals judge added, ìYou have replaced ëadvise and consentí with search and destroy.î†One of the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Lindsey Graham, notably echoed Kavanaughís attack on the Democrats, describing their last-minute leak-and-ambush tactics as ìthe most unethical sham since Iíve been in politics.î† Sen. Ted Cruz agreed with Graham, labeling the Kavanaugh hearings as ìone of the most famous shameful incidents in the history of the U.S. Senate.îTo be sure, the Senate Democratsóincluding, of course, the weirdly gladiator-minded Senator Spartacusñwere bloody mad, too, albeit perhaps because their familiar ìborkingî tactic wasnít working as well as theyíd hoped. †Yes, the anger on both sides of the aisle was obvious.† As a New York Times reporter tweeted: ìWhat I saw today was a fury between members of opposite parties that is as profound and unnerving as Iíve ever seen.† Theyíre not faking it.î †In the meantime, out in the liberal grassroots, the anger was even more obviousóor egregious: Jill Filipovic, a ìscholarî at a D.C. think-tank, tweeted, ìDivorce your Republican husbands.î† And the actress Mira Sorvino called for ìrevolution.î† In other words, pretty much the usual.†For his part, MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes took a more sober tone: ìA legitimacy crisis is unfolding before us and itís only a question of when the cataclysmic moment comes when no one can deny it anymore.îWe neednít agree with Hayes on much of anything to still be struck by his dire words, ìcataclysmic moment,î and political science-y jargon, ìlegitimacy crisis.î† A legitimacy crisis comes when people lose faith in the political system.† And thereís a lot of lost faith going around, for myriad reasons, includingójust to name a very fewóthe Iraq War, the Wall Street bailout, and the doings of the Deep State.†Of course, the ultimate consequences can be, yes, cataclysmic.† Indeed, amidst all the talk of ìcoarsened cultureî and ìpartisan polarization,î one even hears talk, from serious people, about a possible civil war.† Thus we are reminded of Abraham Lincolnís declaration of June 16, 1858: ìA house divided against itself cannot stand.î† And we all know what happened less than three years later. †Yet if the Civil War is a common historical reference point for Americans, as they† look to the past for clues about the future, it is not the most apt reference point.† Why?† Because the Civil War was mostly touched off by slavery, and thatís long gone.† And yet the absence of slavery doesnít mean that there arenít plenty of other potential flashpoints.† Indeed, if we look back at history, we can learn some sobering lessons as to how societies can unravel.†Gloomy Wisdom from a Greek†In particular, we might look to the Greek historian Polybius.† He canít directly address the current state of affairs, since he died in 118 B.C., and yet his wisdom still speaks to us, loud and clear.† In fact, his analysis of political events during polarizing times is timeless. †One of his key themes was the way in which societies transition from one system to another.† For instance, how is it that a democratic system falls apart, to be replaced by another kind of systemóa worse system?†Mindful of the history of the ancient Greek and Roman republics, Polybius observed that a successful democracy had to observe certain groundrules to guide popular participation.† That is, a democracy had to be more than just majority rule; if it was just that, it would prove to be unstable and short-lived. † In his view, simple majoritarianism wasnít democracy at all; it was, instead, to use another Greek word, an ochlocracy.† That is, mob rule.† (Interestingly, the Latin translation of† ìochlocracyî was mobile vulgus, from which we get the word ìmob.î) †This distinction, between democracy and mob rule, is critical.† In The Histories, Polybius noted, ìIt is not enough to constitute a democracy that the whole crowd of citizens should have the right to do whatever they wish or propose.î† Instead, he argues, a successful democracy requires ìtraditional and habitualî virtues of self-restraint, including ìreverence to the gods, succour of parents, respect to elders, obedience to laws.î† Only in such a disciplined context, he continued, can majority rule succeed.† Indeed, only then ìwe may speak of the form of government as a democracy.î†In other words, for a democracy to flourish, certain preconditions have to be met,† including a basic cultural commitment to deliberation and restraint.† If this sounds ìconservativeî to the modern ear, well, so be it, although we can note that Polybius mades no prescription as to, say, tax rates, trade laws, or foreign policy.† He was simply laying down the societal predicates for an effective democracy.† And if that sounds conservative, well, itís the conservatism of prudence and moderation, not conservatism bound to any larger ideology. †Importantly, the American Founders agreed with Polybius; indeed, they specifically relied on him as an intellectual guide.† For instance, James Madison, author of the U.S. Constitution, cited Polybius in a letter to Thomas Jefferson in 1787, and again in Number 63 of the Federalist Papers, published the following year.† (The Federalist Papers, of course, were the articles and pamphlets written in support of the ratification of the Constitution.)†Indeed, itís fair to assert that much of the argument over the Constitution was framed in Polybian termsóthat is, how to keep a democracy from degenerating into a mob-ocracy, and from there, into anarchy and debacle. †In the 18th century, the common word for ìmobî was ìfaction.î† And it was faction, and factionalism, that the Founders feared the most.† And so factionalism was very much on the mind of Madison as he authored the Constitution, a document outlining a rules-based democracy. † Such rules are vital, Madison wrote in Federalist Number 10, because ìa pure democracy . . .† can admit of no cure for the mischiefs of faction.î† Continuing in that vein, Madison warned that factionalism was, inevitably, a formula for civil war: ìThe influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame.îAnd so, he continues, absent proper constitutional restraints, once the majority gets up a head of steam, ìthere is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party.î† Unchecked mobs? Demanding violent sacrifices?† Thatís indeed the stuff of lynchings, even open combat.†Madisonís antidote to the ìmischiefs of factionî was, again, the Constitution, with its carefully calibrated enumeration of powers, spread across three branches of governmentóexecutive, legislative, and judicial.† In other words, Madisonís vision was of a republic, not a pure democracy, or, as some might call it, a democratic republic.† Yet by any name, Madisonís goal was clear: to compartmentalize popular passions and thereby protect the United States.† Revealingly, the title Madison gave to Federalist #10 was, ìThe Utility of the Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection.î†Madison knew that two millennia earlier, Polybius had written about what happens when faction and insurrection run amok: ìThe mob . . . as soon as it has got a leader sufficiently ambitious and daring . . . produces a reign of mere violence.î †To be sure, today we arenít living under a ìreign of mere violenceîóalthough House Majority Steve Scalise would have good reason to differ.† Yet still, we might look around and ask: How far away are we from a mob-ridden dystopia?† Without a doubt, we already have plenty of psychic violenceówe saw a lot of it last week, and not just on Capitol Hill.†For instance, Lauren Baer, the Democratic nominee for Congress in Floridaís 18th Congressional district, spoke on behalf of mob ìvaluesî when she said, ìI stand in solidarity with women and men who share their stories.† Every single allegation of sexual assault and sexual harassment should be heard and believed.î [emphasis added] † To which the rest of us might say, Quick!† Someone get Ms. Baer a copy of the classic novel, To Kill a Mockingbird, which is, of course, all about a false rape accusation.† In the meantime, Brett Kavanaugh must know what itís like to be the subject of Baer-type frenzy.†As Polybius writes, when democracy has yielded to mob rule, itís all downhill: ìThen come tumultuous assemblies, massacres, banishments, redivisions of land.îAnd yet hereís where Polybius gets even more interesting.† As he puts it, just at the moment when the formerly democratic society is ìlosing all trace of civilization,î the trend-line changes.† But it changes, he adds, not back to democracy, but rather, toward tyranny; the mob ìhas once more found a master and a despot.î† In a grim way, this all makes sense: Ordinary people donít want to live in chaos; in the face of unchecked violence and banditry, just about any kind of order is preferable. † And that preference opens the door to tyranny, which may be popularóeven very popularóat least for a time. †Thus we see the heart of Polybiusí argument: If itís not properly tended, a democracy devolves into mob-ocracy, which then gives way to tyranny.†The Modern Polybius†By now, some will have noted that Polybiusí grim historical sequence has a† familiar ring.† Indeed, all over the Internet one sees words of warning, attributed to the Scots historian Alexander Fraser Tytler:The average age of the worldís greatest civilizations from the beginning of history has been about 200 years.† During those 200 years, these nations always progressed through the following sequence: From bondage to spiritual faith; From spiritual faith to great courage; From courage to liberty; From liberty to abundance; From abundance to selfishness; From selfishness to complacency; From complacency to apathy; From apathy to dependence; From dependence back into bondage.†In point of fact, Tytler never said exactly this, although he expressed similar sentiments in an 1801 volume that frequently cited, yes, Polybius.† Actually, though, the above words come from an American businessman, Henning Prentis, writing in the 1940s.Yet thereís not much point in getting bogged down over exact authorship.† Indeed, Polybius deliberately wrote in such a way that any thoughtful observer, in any era, could apply his wisdom:†If a man have a clear grasp of these principles he may perhaps make a mistake as to the dates at which this or that will happen to a particular constitution; but he will rarely be entirely mistaken as to the stage of growth or decay at which it has arrived, or as to the point at which it will undergo some revolutionary change.†What mattersówhether the wisdom comes from Polybius, Tytler, Prentis, or anyone else todayóis that we grasp the moral of the history: We must not let democracy degenerate into chaos, because if we do, the result wonít just be more chaos but, rather, tyranny.† †As we have seen, thatís exactly the fate that Madison and the Founders wished to avoid.† Now, today, in our time, weíre on notice: If we donít reverse the path to† chaos, the American republic, too, will be entered into the annals of history as just another sad failure.†

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/29/democrat-to-voters-fbi-investigation-for-scotus-nominee-standard-procedure-for-decades/,"A Connecticut Democratic member of Congress sent out an email letter to voters in his district in which he said it has been ìstandard procedure for decadesî to have Supreme Court nominees with new allegations against them investigated by the FBI.U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney wrote to voters in his district Friday that Christine Blasey Fordís ìpowerful and credible testimony should give every member of the U.S. Senate pause before moving forward on this nomination for a lifetime appointment to our nationís highest court.îCourtney continued:That is why I strongly support†the proposal today by Republican Senator Jeff Flake from Arizona who is asking that a final vote [on] Kavanaughís nomination be delayed until after the FBI has completed an investigation into the accusations of sexual misconduct against him. It has been standard procedure for decades to refer any new allegations made against a Supreme Court nominee to the FBI for review, and it would be completely unprecedented if an investigation was not undertaken in this instance.Courtney, however, is feeding false information to the voters of his district.†The standard procedure, in fact, is for the Senate Judiciary Committee to investigate new allegations, not the FBI. The Senate Judiciary Committee has its own investigative staff.Thomas Jipping, deputy director of the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, observed†at the Daily Signal that, first, Democrats have already made clear their motivation for another delay: they hope the continued cloud of controversy over Kavanaugh will defeat his nomination and hold the vacant seat on the Supreme Court open until, presumably, they win control of the Senate.Secondly, Jipping pointed out the demand for another FBI investigation ìis not valid and based on a complete misunderstanding of the bureauís role.îìKavanaughís opponents want people to think that the FBI is on standby, ready to run down all the leads and figure out what really happened,î he wrote. ìThat may be what a law enforcement agency does in the criminal justice systemóas seen on TVóbut not in the confirmation process.îJipping continued:In fact, as CBS News recently†described†it, the FBI ìconducts a background check at the request of the White House, mainly to determine whether the nominee would pose a risk to national security interests of the United States, according to the Justice Department.îThat has already been done. Itís worth noting that this ìfull-fieldî FBI investigation has been conducted every time Kavanaugh was hired or appointed to a significant government position. Six times between 1993 and 2018, the FBI went talking to people about Kavanaugh. Six times, all after the incident that Ford alleges, the FBI never heard anyone even whisper a word about sexual misconduct.ìKavanaughís opponents not only want people to think that the FBI has a criminal justice role in the confirmation process, but they mislead people to think that if the FBI does not jump in, there will be no investigation of Fordís allegation,î Jipping wrote.To present a truthful account of the FBI role in allegations against Supreme Court nominees, Courtney would have to direct voters in his district to the words of another Democrat ñ former Vice President Joe Biden ñ who, as the U.S. senator from Delaware in 1991, told†the Senate Judiciary Committee twice that an FBI investigation was worthless as a determination of the facts:The last thing I will point out, the next person who refers to an FBI report as being worth anything, obviously doesnít understand anything. FBI explicitly does not, in this or any other case, reach a conclusion, period. Period.The reason why we cannot rely on the FBI report [is] you would not like it if we did because it is inconclusive. They say, ëHe said, she said, and they said.í Period.ìSo when people wave an FBI report before you, understand they do not, they do not reach conclusions,î Biden said.ìThe mantra of ëFBI investigationí by Kavanaughís opponents is misleading in its purpose and has no validity,î Jipping continued. ìThe confirmation process is already structured and equipped to evaluate even unexpected allegations as they arise and will do so as, in Kavanaughís case, it nears a conclusion.îCommon sense request from the @ABAesq who endorsed Kavanaugh. The Senate and the country need an FBI inquiry before any votes take place. #KavanaughConfirmation https://t.co/ViXWpGTbCGó Rep. Joe Courtney (@RepJoeCourtney) September 28, 2018In his letter to voters, Courtney also cites the call for another FBI investigation from ìthe nonpartisan American Bar Association (ABA) which previously declared Kavanaugh to be qualified for the Supreme Court.îHowever, Courtney failed to inform voters in his district that ABA president Robert Carlson is not a member of the organizationís Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary ñ which reviews Supreme Court nominees and already gave Kavanaugh its highest rating ñ and the controversy within the ABA over Carlsonís call for another FBI investigation.The Wall Street Journal†editorial board observed:Mr. Carlson is not a member of that committee, and he is not supposed to speak for the ABA unless the legal group has made a policy decision. In this case he is trying to sandbag his own ABA colleagues. Paul Moxley, the Utah lawyer who chairs the ABAís judicial committee, made that clear on Friday when he wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Mr. Carlsonís letter ìwas not receivedî by his ABA committee ìprior to its issuance.î Mr. Moxley added: ìThe ABAís rating for Judge Kavanaugh is not affected by Mr. Carlsonís letter.îIn other words, Mr. Carlson is free-lancing for partisan purposes and the Senate should ignore him. For the rest of us, however, this is one more reason to bar the ABA from any judicial vetting. Some of us still remember the ABAís shoddy treatment of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.Similarly, in a statement sent to Breitbart News, Ronald A. Cass,†Dean Emeritus at†Boston University School of Law and†President of†Cass & Associates, PC, wrote:As a former member of the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, representing the DC Circuit, I was impressed with the American Bar Associationís work on this nomination.I am, however, deeply disappointed to see the recent statement of the ABAís President, who does not serve on this Committee and has no authority to speak for the Committee or the Association on qualifications of judicial nominees, calling for a pause in Senate proceedings on the Kavanaugh nomination pending further investigation.The Standing Committee, which is the sole entity within the ABA charged with evaluating federal judicial nominees and conveying its assessments to the Senate, works in a bipartisan manner, takes its work very seriously, does thorough investigations and careful considerations. After a thorough investigation, it unanimously accorded Judge Kavanaugh its highest rating. To suggest, as the ABA President implicitly does, that it overlooked important information is both contrary to what is in the public domain today and disrespectful of the men and women who serve on the Standing Committee.In a column at Breitbart News, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) wrote†the delay afforded by another FBI investigation serves a political purpose.ìWhat Senate Democrats really want is more time to smear Judge Kavanaugh, regardless of the toll it takes on his wife, his daughters, and our country,î the senator said.Democrats ìhave never been about getting the facts or finding the truth,î Cassidy asserted. ìIf they were, they would have alerted law enforcement months ago, as soon as they learned of the claims. Instead, they waited until the last minute to leak them in order to delay the vote.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/29/one-of-kavanaughs-late-accusers-is-referred-for-prosecution-for-lying/,"The Senate Judiciary Committee made a criminal referral Saturday for the Rhode Island man who claimed Judge Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted his friend on a boat in 1985, asking that he be prosecuted for lying to Congress.In a letter, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) asks Attorney General Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray that the accuser, whose name was redacted, be investigated for ìpotential violations of 18 U.S.C. ßß 1001 and 1505, for materially false statements [he] made to the Committee as part of its investigation of allegations against Judge Kavanaugh.îThe accuserís name has been redacted in all Senate documents since this allegation first became public with the release of a transcript from Kavanaughís Monday conference call under penalty of felony, in which he cateogorically denied it. Journalists, however, were quickly able to find the social media account referenced along with the allegation. The account identified itself as ìJeffrey†Catalanî and had been used to make calls for President Donald Trump to be overthrown by a military coup and accusations the president had murdered someone† in 1983. The account describes its owner as a ìGraphic Artist, Artist, photography and writer. Hippie, First Responder, Father and Grandpaî from Tiverton, Rhode Island.The Jeffrey Catalan account promptly retracted the allegation Wednesday night, claiming he made ìa mistakeî when he claimed a 20-year-old Judge Kavanuagh sexually assaulted a woman on a boat and that he then severely beat Kavanaugh for it. Grassleyís Saturday letter references this retraction, confirming the identification of the accuser as ìJeffrey Catalan,î although, because of the redaction, it is still not clear if that is the manís real name.ìCatalan,î referred to as a ìRhode Island constituent,î called Sen. Sheldon Whitehouseís (D-RI) office on Monday morning. He claimed that in Newport, Rhode Island, in August of 1985, he and a friend had confronted two other men named ìBrett and Markî and gave them a beating that left Brett and Mark with severe injuries. They, according to the call, had gone down to find Brett and Mark by the pier because an unnamed female friend told them she had been sexually assaulted by the pair on a boat after meeting them at a local bar.Catalan claimed he knew that ìBrett,î the man he severely beat 33 years ago, was Judge Kavanaugh after seeing Kavanaughís high school yearbook photo on the news jogged his memory.Whitehouseís office considered the allegation credible enough to pass it on to the Judiciary Committee as a whole, leading committee staff to question Kavanaugh over the alleged incident later on Monday. Whitehouse himself, as is clear from a letter to the committee released Saturday, also sent the allegation to the FBI and gave the accuser a contact of his in the media to help break the story.As with the at least four other accusations of sexual misconduct for which the Judiciary Committee has investigated Kavanaugh, the judge flatly denied it occurred.†ìI was not in Newport, havenít†been on a boat in Newport. Not with Mark Judge on a boat,†nor all those three things combined. This is just†completely made up, or at least not me. I donít know what†theyíre referring to,î he told committee investigators.With Catalanís retraction, it was clear enough to Grassley that the man had likely lied to Senator Whitehouse. Lying to congressional staff about an official matter they are investigating and deliberately obstructing a congressional investigation are both felonies, even when the intentionally misleading statements are not made under oath.ìThe Committee is grateful to citizens who come forward with relevant information in good faith, even if they are not one hundred percent sure about what they know,î Grassley wrote in his letter. ìBut when individuals provide fabricated allegations to the Committee, diverting Committee resources during time-sensitive investigations, it materially impedes our work. Such acts are not only unfair; they are potentially illegal.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/29/barr-truly-terrible-damage-wrought-jeff-flake/,"Any member of Congress is capable at any time of doing harm to his or her political party or even the country itself.Casting a vote undermining a carefully crafted piece of legislation after committing to colleagues not to do so. Making a public statement clearly at odds with universally accepted norms. Engaging in conduct that is unlawful, unethical, or both. Refusing to apologize when such an act clearly is necessary and appropriate. These are but a few actions in which a senator or member of Congress can engage that can hurt their party colleagues or, in extreme cases, the country.Rarely, however, can someone in as important a position as a sitting United States senator do such great harm as that by Arizonaís Sen. Jeff Flake in telling his Republican Party, and indeed the entire country, that he would refuse to vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the floor of the Senate ó even after voting to have the nomination reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee on which he serves ó unless the FBI conducts another investigation; this one focused on the allegations leveled against Kavanaugh after the week-long hearings conducted by the committee earlier this month.Many Republicans in Congress and the administration, while critical of Flakeís last-minute but not altogether unexpected shenanigans, downplay the potential cost of subjecting Kavanaugh and his family to yet another week of the Hell to which they already have been subject. The silver lining on which these Republicans focus seems to be their conclusion that all the witnesses who already have come out in support of the judgeís side of the story, will be consistent and tell the FBI the exact same thing in the course of this new investigation. Unfortunately, in the real world, what someone says one day does not always jibe precisely with what they might choose to say on another day to a different person. Even if that discrepancy is not made with ill intent, and notwithstanding that an intervieweeís recollection or retelling of an event may not be significant, rest assured that the Left will seize on any such instance as yet more evidence of Kavanaughís guilt and as reason to further undermine his credibility.Even more problematic is the possibility that ó despite the judgeís obvious excellent, if not phenomenal memory and impressive attention to detail ó he personally says something at odds with his testimony already on the record or that he stated in an earlier interview with the FBI or any other federal official. Can you envision the firestorm of renewed calls by senators and House members for not only his defeat in the Senate vote, but as grounds for his later impeachment? You can hear the wails already: ìA Supreme Court justice who has perjured himself and lied under oath. This cannot stand!îFlakeís truly idiotic demand that his Senate vote can be had only if yet more investigation be done of what surely is the most investigated judicial nominee in our countryís history, will come back to haunt the nation long after this vote is taken. And the political damage this lone senator has wrought will reverberate in the fast-approaching mid-term election, regardless of whether Judge Kavanaugh is confirmed by the Senate, and definitely not to the advantage of the GOP.In demanding precisely what every Democrat on the Judiciary Committee had sought, but which the Republicans had ó amazingly ó held the line against, Flake gave the other party credibility and cover they would not otherwise have. Now, thanks to Flake, every Democratic candidate will be able to claim that their incessant calls for further investigation of the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh were ìbipartisan.î And technically, such a claim would be truthful.As anyone who possesses even a rudimentary knowledge of contemporary politics knows to a certainty, regardless of what the coming investigation of Kavanaughís accusers yields, the Democrats will continue their harangue against the GOP, the President, and the Judge himself. If the good Sen. Flake thought he might be purchasing for himself some goodwill from his colleagues on the other side of the aisle, or perhaps lining up left-leaning clients for his post-senatorial career, he is sadly mistaken. The Left will shun him now that he has given them what they craved. The GOP will remember him as a Benedict Arnold. And he will fade into the Arizona sunset as a modern-day Icarus blinded by his own misguided yearning to be admired.

Kavanaughís truthfulness with the Senate goes to the very heart of whether he should be confirmed to the court.îSanders wrote in the letter that the FBI must not only investigate the accusations made by California psychology professor Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Debora Ramirez, and Julie Swetnick, but they should also look into Kavanaughís testimony before the Judiciary Committee.ìIn order for the FBI investigation regarding Judge Brett Kavanaughís nomination to be complete, it is imperative the bureau must not only look into the accusations made by Dr. [Christine Blasey] Ford, Debora Ramirez and Julie Swetnick, it should also examine the veracity of his testimony before the Judiciary Committee,î Sanders wrote in the letter.ìA fundamental question the FBI can help answer is whether Judge Kavanaugh has been truthful with the committee. This goes to the very heart of whether he should be confirmed to the court,î Sandersí letter continued.The Vermont senator also called for the FBI investigation to take longer than one week, citing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellís decision to delay holding a hearing for Merrick Garlandís nomination to the Supreme Court for almost a year.ìIf you are concerned with a delay in this confirmation process, remember that Senate Republicans refused to allow the Senate to consider Merrick Garlandís nomination to the Supreme Court for nearly a year,î Sanders wrote.One of Kavanaughís accusers, Dr. Ford, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, and Kavanaugh also testified before the committee responding to her allegations that he sexually assaulted her at a high school party in 1982.The Senate Judiciary Committee voted Friday in an 11-10 party-line vote to send Kavanaughís confirmation to the Senate floor but decided to take into account Sen.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) utilizing the sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh to fundraise for Harrisís Democratic colleague from Indiana, Sen. Joe Donnelly, who is facing a reelection battle.ìI walked out,î Harris boasts in the fundraising appeal. ìRepublicans rushed Judge Kavanaughís confirmation with a sham hearing yesterday morning, less than 24 hours after Dr. Christine Blasey Ford had the courage to tell her story in front of the entire country. Itís a disgrace. So, instead of sitting through the farce Ö I walked out.îHarris launches into a bid petitioning MoveOn.org members to ìrushî contributions as little as $3 to Donnelly:I know Iím not alone in this fight; millions of Americans are with me. And as of yesterday morning, Iím proud to say that my colleague, Indiana Senator Joe Donnelly, is with me. After hearing Dr. Blasey Ford testify and seeing the GOP effort to push through this confirmation, Sen. Donnelly has said heíll vote no on Kavanaugh.But Sen. Donnelly is in one of the toughest reelection fights this yearóand we know his opponent, a right-wing candidate whoíll march in line with Senators McConnell and Grassley and Donald Trumpówill attack him for this vote. Thatís why Iím asking:Can MoveOn members around the country help in getting Joeís back?Click here to rush a contribution of $3 to Joe Donnelly to help have his back and end Republican control of the Senate in November.The hyperlink in the email takes subscribers to a MoveOn.org contribution page at ActBlue, the online fundraising giant used by Democrats and progressive groups.MoveOn.org has been massively backed by billionaire George Soros. It has also been financed by the Tides Foundation, a leftwing sponsorship organization that has itself received donations from Soros and has partnered with Sorosís Open Society Foundations.MoveOn.org has taken center stage in opposing Kavanaugh, leading a #StopKavanaugh campaign aimed at mobilizing supporters to call their senators in opposition to Kavanaughís nomination.ìCall your senator and tell them to #StopKavanaugh,î MoveOn.org demands. ìBrett Kavanaugh could gut or overturn Roe v. Wade and the Affordable Care Act, canít be counted on to hold Trump accountable for any criminal activity, and has repeatedly sided with corporations and the wealthy over workers and protecting our environment.îOn Saturday, Politico reported on progressive groups, including MoveOn.org, making a ìlast-minute push to stop Kavanaugh.îìWhat weíre looking to do right now is to find ways to carry the energy, especially in whatís transpired in the last 18 hours,î Erica Mauter, campaign director at MoveOn.org, told Politico. ìPhone calls are important, but actually showing upÖyou feel other peopleís energy, itís not just you.îAaron Klein is Breitbartís Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/29/murray-senate-gop-faces-question-of-whether-senate-is-place-where-women-are-respected/,"During Fridayís Democratic Weekly Address, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) stated that Senate Republicans face a few questions, including, ìIs the United States Senate a place where women are listened to, heard, and respected, or is it still just one more place where womenís voices will be swept under the rug, where our voices are ignored, attacked, and undermined?îTranscript as Follows:ìHi, Iím Senator Patty Murray from Washington State.Like so many women and men across the country, I watched Dr. Ford testify on Thursday with tears in my eyes. Her courage is truly incredible, and she is an inspiration to women and girls and sexual assault survivors across the country. Now that we have seen Dr. Ford share her experience so bravely and vividly, and we have heard what Judge Kavanaugh has to say regarding just one of the allegations he faces, the eyes of the nation are on this Supreme Court nomination, and the Republicans who control the Senate face a few very simple but absolutely critical questions. Is the United States Senate a place where women are listened to, heard, and respected, or is it still just one more place where womenís voices will be swept under the rug, where our voices are ignored, attacked, and undermined? Will the United States Senate do its job when it comes to our constitutional advice and consent role and truly look into this nominee and make sure he is fit to sit on our nationís Supreme Court, or will we rush through this process, not allow all the voices to be heard or information to be brought forward, and try to jam this nominee through,†no matter what?People across the country are watching closely, and I am hoping that Senate Republicans allow us to get these questions right. Because, letís take a step back here,
multiple women have bravely come forward to share their experiences regarding Judge Kavanaugh and sexual assault. These women were immediately attacked.†President Trump and some Senate Republicans said they were making it up, that if their claims were true they would have reported it when it happened, that they were ëmixed up.í Part of a smear campaign, engaged in a ëdrive-by shootingë of Judge Kavanaugh, and much ó and worse. It has been truly horrific. And now, instead of listening to these women, digging into these serious allegations, and doing their jobs, Senate Republicans seem intent on rushing this nomination through to confirm Judge Kavanaugh, no matter what he may have done.But hereís the bottom line, and itís something that should not be partisan or controversial, the United States Senate should do its job. Senate Republicans should allow us to do our jobs. They should allow a full FBI investigation of these allegations, which all of the women have welcomed and called for, but that Judge Kavanaugh and the people trying to protect him are trying to prevent from happening. If he has truly nothing to hide, and he truly wants the facts to come out, he should welcome this. They should hold more hearings with the women who have come forward, along with all the relevant witnesses to testify under oath. And they should slow this down and end this mad dash to a confirmation. The only reason to rush would be to protect Judge Kavanaugh and prevent the truth from coming out, no matter what he has done. That would be absolutely wrong and it would be unacceptable.I first decided to run for the Senate when I saw an all-male Judiciary Committee mistreat Anita Hill in 1991 during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings. I ran to be a voice for the women and men across the country who thought it was absolutely wrong for her to be ignored and attacked and swept aside and disbelieved. And now, 27 years later, women and men are watching. Our daughters, sons, and grandkids are watching. Theyíre paying attention. They are asking those questions I asked before, will women be listened to? Will women be heard? And this time, I hope the United States Senate gets it right.Thank you.îFollow Ian†Hanchett on Twitter†@IanHanchett

He can coach,î McFadden said.But the article takes it a step further, claiming that accusations without evidence should warrant no investigation.ìCredibly accused sex offenders should not coach youth basketball, girls or boys, without deeper investigation,î the article states.Although the columnist wrote the article as an opinion piece for the paper, USA Today promoted the article on social media as a straight news article. The piece prompted social media users to slam the paper for its ìdisgracefulî article:This is disgraceful, @usatodaysports. The man was accused of atrocities with no evidence, no corroboration, no proof. Heís undergone 6 FBI investigations in his life. Maybe wait to criminalize someone till you have damn good reason? Iím utterly disgusted. https://t.co/Rk3DeLCEubó Jedediah Bila (@JedediahBila) September 29, 2018This is a truly evil piece.ó Charles C. W. Cooke (@charlescwcooke) September 29, 2018Thousands of other Twitter users said they would ìnever readî or ìvisitî USA Todayís website ever again and some even claimed they would ìvote straight Republicanî this November due to the paperís antics.Former Homeland Security undersecretary Michael Brown even said the article used ìuncorroborated allegationsî from over 30 years ago to call Kavanaugh ìa pedophileî:Let me get this straight @USATODAYÖyou believe uncorroborated allegations from 30+ years ago allow in essence to call someone a pedophile? #Kavanaugh claims the media will continue to attack him and you just proved his point.

Thatís whatís wrong with Jeff Flake.îHe continued, ìJeff Flake has no†spine. No one can say that right now because theyíre under this illusion that Jeff Flake is somehow going to back them up on the Senate floor when thereís a floor vote.îBongino said the Democrats know the FBI investigation is not going to bring any ìclarity to this situation,î but they wanted it because ìthey needed a delay.î He observed, ìAnd Jeff Flake gave it to them.

These are people who have been told theyíre worthless and bigoted. They have been unfairly maligned because they are in the way of other people gaining power.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/pro-life-leaders-slam-sen-joe-donnelly-on-kavanaugh-no-vote/,"National pro-life leaders say Sen. Joe Donnelly is making a serious career mistake in his decision to vote against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List), said:Joe Donnellyís decision to vote against Judge Kavanaugh is a profound betrayal and Indiana voters will remember this at the ballot box in November. Instead of standing with Hoosiers ñ who showed their trust in President Trump to nominate Supreme Court justices when they elected him by a 19-point margin ñ Donnelly caved to pressure from Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin and the radical abortion lobby.Read Joe's statement on the Kavanaugh nomination: pic.twitter.com/JvjTOKEDyFó Senator Joe Donnelly (@SenDonnelly) September 28, 2018Donnelly, who claims to be pro-life, announced his decision Thursday, stating he had ìdeep reservationsî about Kavanaughís nomination. He criticized Senate majority Leader Mitch McConnell for not agreeing to an FBI investigation of Kavanaugh, though in 1991, then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE) told†the Senate Judiciary Committee twice that an FBI investigation was worthless as a determination of the facts:The last thing I will point out, the next person who refers to an FBI report as being worth anything, obviously doesnít understand anything. FBI explicitly does not, in this or any other case, reach a conclusion, period. Period.The reason why we cannot rely on the FBI report [is] you would not like it if we did because it is inconclusive. They say, ëHe said, she said, and they said.í Period.ìSo when people wave an FBI report before you, understand they do not, they do not reach conclusions,î Biden said.ìJoe Donnelly is about to make the biggest mistake in his career if he does not change his mind ñ which he still has some days to do,î Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life told Breitbart News in a statement. He added:For one thing, any senator who votes ìNoî on Judge Kavanaugh will be legitimizing the most shameful smear campaign ever to occur in American politics, and discouraging every future nominee from saying ìYesî to the call to serve in the federal court system.† And another reason this is a mistake for Senator Donnelly is that I will personally ñ and without apology or ambiguity ñ use all my communication platforms to urge every voter within my reach in the state of Indiana to vote against him in November.Dannenfelser also said the SBA List field team ìhas spent months on the ground in Indiana where we will be active through Election Day, reaching out to pro-life voters who donít always get to the polls, as well as persuadable Democrats, Independents, and Hispanic voters.îìHoosiers deserve better than Joe Donnelly,î she added.Donnelly is facing off against Hoosier businessman Mike Braun in a competitive race in November.ìDonnellyís decision to oppose President Trumpís highly qualified nominee is a grave mistake, but proves he is more concerned with standing with his liberal Democrat leaders than standing for Hoosiers,î Braun said. ìI continue to strongly support Judge Kavanaughís confirmation to the Supreme Court.îSBA Listís ground activity is part of an historic effort to visit more than two million homes across the battleground states of Indiana, Ohio, Florida, Missouri, West Virginia, North Dakota, and Montana ahead of Election Day 2018.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/09/28/joe-digenova-kavanaugh-inquisition-is-our-future-with-democrats-in-power/,"Former U.S. Attorney Joe diGenova framed Thursdayís Senate Judiciary Committee hearings with Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh as glimpses of Americaís future with Democrat congressional majorities. He offered his remarks in a Friday interview with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow on SiriusXMís Breitbart News Daily.DiGenova said, ìWhat you saw on display by the Democrats on that committee was the raw political power that they will wield against people of goodwill, and all you have to do to know that is whatís going to happen is look at what the IRS did to conservative groups under Lois Lerner and John Koskinen.îDiGenova continued, ìThis is the future of our country if the Democrats get control of the House and Senate. They are vile people. There is nothing good anymore to be said about the Democratic Party. They have eschewed all integrity [and] honesty in pursuit of power. They are an ugly people, and they need to be beaten down politically and defeated.îLISTEN:DiGenova described the dual Ford-Kavanaugh hearings as politically damaging for Democrats.ìI think the Democratsí worst nightmare occurred, and that is that Christine Blasey Ford testified,î said diGenova. ìIt was a terrible mistake, because what you saw was a terribly troubled woman with deep emotional problems.îDiGenova described Fordís testimony as ìadolescentî and ìliterally unbelievable.îìJust think about this,î began diGenova. ìThis is a woman in her fifties, who 35 years ago said someone attempted to sexually assault her. She then cannot tell you where it happened, when it happened, how she got there, how she left. She left her best friend there, presumably to be raped by these two mad men.îDiGenova went on, ìHer testimony was adolescent in nature. Her emotional state after 35 years was literally unbelievable. In my opinion, the best thing that happened to Judge Kavanaugh with the public disclosure of these now clearly false allegations was that people got to see her. They got to see her, and they got to see him.îDiGenova praised Sen. Lindsey Grahamís (R-SC) criticisms of Democrats within the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he is a member.ìThe top of the day was Sen. Lindsey Graham, who in my opinion, gets the profile in courage award of the decade,î remarked diGenova. ìHe saved a Supreme Court nomination and shamed fellow Republicans who might otherwise have been doubtful into understanding the stakes, the grown-up stakes, when you allow a bunch of Democratic thugs who betrayed their oath of office to the United States Senate, and who should all be up on ethics charges in the Senate. DiGenova continued, ìHe saved the Senate. This was a great moment in American history and I am so glad that the cameras were rolling for the moment when Lindsey Graham threw off the mantle of John McCain and became his own person. That was a new Lindsey Graham yesterday. He is not the same person he was last week. I have to tell you, I am so proud of Lindsey Graham and what he did. You just cannot believe what itís like in this town, what it was like last night. That was one of the great moments in American history, and I am so thrilled that it was on tape, and to watch the Democrats with their mouths agape, unable to respond, except for the unbelievably stupid and lame response from Dianne Feinstein, a woman who is now infamous for her duplicity and dishonesty.îDiGenova described Ford as ìdeeply troubledî and an ìemotional wreck.îDiGenova said, ìIt is clear to me, after having been a prosecutor and a congressional counsel overseeing confirmation hearing for judges, this woman, whatever may be her state of mind, is a deeply troubled person.îDiGenova added, ìThere is not a scintilla evidence of physical, intellectual, corroborative evidence to her story. In fact, it is a fantasy. It never happened. There is no evidence it ever happened. Her unconfirmed personal report given her own admission of her mental and emotional problems makes her story simply unbelievable.DiGenova continued, ìShe was an emotional wreck. If you want to say thatís credibility, fine. She was an emotional wreck, but that was self-induced. There was nothing on the record to confirm that Judge Kavanaugh did anything.îDeGenova remarked on what he said was Fordís ìmental instability.îìIt was a sign of Fordís mental instability that attorney Rachel Mitchell was able to draw out of her by developing confidence very quickly through a non-threatening dialogue,î observed diGenova. ì[Ford] actually admitted, without difficulty, that she flew all over the world, had no problem doing it, and did it for fun and for business,î added diGenova. ìMitchell was able to draw that out and establish one of the most disturbing sets of facts, was that it was a lie that she couldnít fly to Washington. Ö I give A-plus to Miss Mitchell. Ö She drew the Democrats into a false sense of security.îDiGenova praised Kavanaughís statements and responses to Senatorsí inquiries. ì[Kavanaugh] actually surpassed Clarence Thomas,î assessed diGenova. ìI was completely taken aback by the ferocity of his defense. Ö It threw the Democrats for a loop. They did not know what to do.ìWhen all was said and done, the Democrats didnít know what to do,î commented diGenova. ìThey didnít know how to question him. The Democrats went on display with what they think is their best and it ended up being their worst face ñ hey, may have done more damage to their 2018 electoral prospects by that unprofessional, undignified, sleazy performance, than any group of campaign commercials ever could have done.îDiGenova concluded, ìI think Judge Kavanaugh was so good and so honest and so compelling that by the time Lindsey Graham was able to make his historic presentation to the chamber and the world, it was over. Everybody expected Kavanaugh to roll over and play dead, and he would have none of it. This was a brilliant performance by a jurist who is not known for anything other than quiet, non-tempestuous contemplation. He pulled out of the bag what I call righteous Catholic indignation. This was, in essence, a burning at the stake. What they were doing with Kavanaugh was burning him at the stake, and he would have none of it.îDemocrat senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee are ìdespicable,î ìunethicalî and ìfundamentally dishonest,î said diGenova.ìWhen you look at that group of people on the Democratic side, they are a despicable, unethical bunch,î opined diGenova. ìI am just so pleased that these hearings turned out the way they did because America got a look at what the Democratic Party has become. These are fundamentally dishonest people [and] power-hungry.îìThe Democratic Party is no longer a party. It is a gang of thugs. Ö It showed how desperate and how fundamentally dishonest the Democrats are,î said diGenova.Breitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.Follow Robert Kraychik on†Twitter.

Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who recommended the full Senate vote to confirm Kavanaugh be pushed back in order for a seven-day FBI probe to take place.îI think it would be proper to delay the floor vote for up to but not more than one week in order to let the FBI do an investigation, limited in time and scope to the current allegations that are there, limited in time to no more than one week,î the Arizona lawmaker said prior the committee vote. ìAnd I will vote to advance the bill to the floor with that understanding.î Shortly before 2:00 p.m., the committee voted 11-10 to recommend the judge be the next Supreme Court Justice.Hours later, the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced President Donald Trump ordered the bureau to investigate the matter.†ìIíve ordered the FBI to conduct a supplemental investigation to update Judge Kavanaughís file,î the presidentís statement read. ìAs the Senate has requested, this update must be limited in scope and completed in less than one week.îPrior to releasing the presidentís statement, Kavanaugh, through White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah, communicated his†readiness to cooperate with the investigation.††ìThroughout this process, Iíve been interviewed by the FBI, Iíve done a number of ëbackgroundí calls directly with the Senate, and yesterday, I answered questions under oath about every topic the Senators and their counsel asked me,î the Court pick said. ìIíve done everything they have requested and will continue to cooperate.î

Instead, they waited until the last minute to leak them in order to delay the vote.That is why any FBI investigation of the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh should include potential coordination between the Democrat operatives and lawyers that assisted in bringing them forth.What Senate Democrats really want is more time to smear Judge Kavanaugh, regardless of the toll it takes on his wife, his daughters, and our country.Democrats will not suddenly require evidence to declare Judge Kavanaugh guilty of being the worst kind of criminal. They will not suddenly abandon their assumption that all accusations against Republicans are credible and to be believed.If the FBI turns up nothing significant, they will say what Joe Biden said in 1991, that the FBI does not reach conclusions. They will say the FBI did not have enough time to conduct a thorough investigation.What they will not do is admit they were wrong to accuse Judge Kavanaugh of being a gang rapist, or a rapist, or a sexual assaulter, or a drunk, or a perjurer, or a hothead unfit for the bench.If the delay facilitates new allegations from Michael Avenatti or someone else, it will not matter how ludicrous they are. Democrats will instantly call them credible, demand more delays, more FBI resources, and more hearings. They will attack anyone who disagrees.Delay, delay, delay. Thatís all they want, because their goal is to do anything and everything to smear any nominee ó anyone ó and block Republicans from appointing another justice to the Supreme Court.We cannot and should not let that happen.Dr. Bill Cassidy, MD, a Republican, is the senior senator from Louisiana.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/senate-judiciary-committee-recommends-kavanaugh-confirmation-flake-calls-week-delay/,"The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 11-10 Friday to recommend Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be the next associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, with Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) making a last-minute stand that the final full-Senate vote be delayed for not more than one week.Flake agreed to join with fellow Republicans Friday morning, only to retreat to the committee anteroom for nearly an hour to conference with Democrats before the vote. When he emerged for the vote, chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) allowed Flake to speak. Flake then announced he would vote yes on Kavanaugh for committee recommendation but with the stipulation†that he would support another delay before the Senate floor vote that otherwise could have taken place as soon as Monday.Flake was unequivocal that the delay, to allow additional†investigation by the FBI, be limited to no longer than one week, meaning a final vote by next Friday. He also insisted the investigation be ìlimited in scope.îThe Justice Department has repeatedly characterized the FBIís role as limited to investigating potential federal crimes, of which there are none in this case, and conducting background investigations to collect information on nominees, which has already been done, including with regard to†Christine Blasey Fordís allegations. The exact perimeters of a new investigation were not clear from Flakeís comments.After a brief walk-out, Sens. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Mazie Hirono (D-HI) reneged and voted against Kavanaugh with the rest of their Party.The vote brings to close what could be the penultimate chapter in a chaotic, bitter, and polarizing confirmation process. After more than 30 hours of public testimony, hours more of closed-door hearings, and an excess of 1,200 written questions, Democrat senators and left-leaning news outlets made a national scandal out of a sexual misconduct allegation that ranking member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) kept to herself for nearly two months.Fordís allegation, that a 17-year-old Kavanaugh groped her at a high school party more than 35 years ago, begat a series of additional allegations of increasing severity, culminating in a sworn affidavit by Michael Avenattiís client, Julie Swetnick, that Kavanaugh helped arrange drug-induced gang rapes in the Washington, DC, area for years.In one of the most closely watched Senate committee hearings in recent years, both Ford and Kavanaugh addressed the alleged incident in hours of testimony under oath, Ford adamantly standing by her allegation and Kavanaugh indignantly and categorically denying any such incident.The chaos that has characterized Kavanaughís entire confirmation process returned briefly after the Judiciary Committee voted, with Democrats seizing on Flakeís speech to reiterate their call for additional investigation and Grassley abruptly adjourning the meeting after they had spoken their peace.

Maize Hirono (D-HI), and Anita Hill, who was once the subject of a similar Congressional hearing during the Clarence Thomas nomination.ìAs Judge Kavanaugh stands to gain the lifetime privilege of serving on the countryís highest court, he has the burden of persuasion. And that is only fair,î Hill said earlier in September.As Ms. Hill and Sen. Hirono aver, the Democratic standard for sexual-assault allegations is that they should be accepted as true merely for having been made. The accuser is assumed to be telling the truth because the accuser is a woman. The burden is on Mr. Kavanaugh to prove his innocence. If he cannot do so, then he is unfit to serve on the Court.This turns American justice and due process upside down. The core tenet of Anglo-American law is that the burden of proof always rests with the person making the accusation. An accuser canít doom someoneís freedom or career merely by making a charge.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/joe-donnelly-i-will-oppose-brett-kavanaughs-nomination-to-supreme-court/,"Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), who faces a competitive re-election campaign, said in a statement on Friday that he will oppose Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Sen. Donnelly said that if Judge Kavanaughís nomination comes before the Senate for a vote, ìI will oppose it.îRead Joe's statement on the Kavanaugh nomination: pic.twitter.com/JvjTOKEDyFó Senator Joe Donnelly (@SenDonnelly) September 28, 2018Sen. Donnelly explained that he will oppose Kavanaughís nomination because he believes that the FBI should investigate California psychology professor Christine Blasey Fordís accusation that Kavanaugh allegedly attempted to sexually assault her when they were both in high school in the 1980ís.Donnelly said:I have deep reservations about Judge Kavanaughís nomination to this lifetime position and, as I stated we have been unable to get all the infomration necessary regarding this nomination, despite my best efforts. Only 113 people have ever served on the Supreme Court, and I believe that we must do our level best to protect its sanctity.While I would gladly welcome the opportunity to work with President Trump on a new nominee for the critically important position, if Judge Kavanaughís nomination comes before the full Senate for a vote under these circumstances, I will oppose it.Donnelly faces a competitive race in a state that Donald Trump won by 19 points during the 2016 presidential election.A Fox News survey released in September found that Hoosier businessman Mike Braun, Donnellyís Republican challenger, leadsó45 to 43 percentóagainst Donnelly in the Indiana Senate race.The survey also found that 29 percent of Hoosiers said that a vote against Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court would make it less likely for them to support Donnelly in the fall midterm election, while 21 percent said they would support the Indiana Democrat and 38 percent suggested it would not make a difference.The poll also found that 54 percent of Hoosiers approve of Trumpís job performance.Chris Anderson, a Democratic pollster, said in September that Donnelly will have a tough time trying to get re-elected in a red-state Indiana.ìIn an electorate that is likely to be nearly 90 percent white and majority female, a Democrat has almost no path to victory without at least drawing even among white women,î Anderson said.Daron Shaw, who conducted the Fox News poll with Anderson, said,†ìThis is a Republican state, and this seat is one of the most difficult that the Democrats are defending. Donnelly is even with suburban whites and manages to get 12 percent of Hoosiers who voted for Trump, yet heís still down in the race right now.î

Dianne Feinsteinís decision to keep†Christine Blasey Fordís allegation private ìfor six weeks,î only to make a public spectacle that turned the hearing into a ìcircus.îLike Kavanaugh himself, the board did not reject that emotion or pain displayed by Ford, Rather, they noted that not a shred of evidence was put forth to tie Kavanaugh to Fordís claims.The board wrote: ìYet there is still no confirming evidence beyond her own testimony, and some of what she says has been contradicted. The female friend Ms. Ford says was at the home the night of the assault says she wasnít there. The number of people she says were there has varied from four to five and perhaps more, but every potential witness she has cited by name says he or she doesnít recall the party.îThey added:She still canít recall the home where the assault took place, how she got there or how she got home that evening. She has no witnesses who say she told them about the alleged assault at the timeóuntil she first spoke of it at a couples therapy session 30 years later in 2012. Mr. Kavanaughís name doesnít appear in the notes of her therapist.The board then transited to Kavanaughís defense of himself and noted that he was righteously indignant because he had been publicly accused, and pre-judged in some quarters, for something he adamantly denied doing. They noted, ìAs for Judge Kavanaugh, his self-defense was as powerful and emotional as the moment demanded. If he was angry at times, imagine how you would feel if you were so accused and were innocent as he says he is.îThe Wall Street Journal headline says simply, ìConfirm Brett Kavanaugh.îAWR†Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host†of the Breitbart podcast†Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of†Down Range with AWR Hawkins,†a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

The letter was witnessed and sent by his attorney:As I stated in my attorney, Barbara Van Gelderís September 18, 2018 letter, I did not ask to be involved in this matter nor did anyone ask me to be involved. We have told the committee that I do not want to comment about these events publicly. As a recovering alcoholic and a cancer survivor, I have struggled with depression and anxiety. As a result, I avoid public speaking.Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school, but we have not spoken directly in several years. I do not recall the events described by Dr. Ford in her testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee today. I never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes.I am knowingly submitting this letter under penalty of felony.Judge was the subject of several Democratsí questions to Kavanaugh because of Judgeís alcoholic-fueled lifestyle as a young man, which he chronicled in a fictional account published in the late 1990s, entitled Wasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk.Many Democrats called for Judge to come before the committee under oath to discuss Fordís allegations against Kavanaugh.†Judge has already submitted a letter to the committee denying he witnessed Kavanaugh sexually assaulting Ford.The committee is scheduled to vote Kavanaugh out of committee today ahead of a full Senate vote.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/jesuit-magazine-withdraws-endorsement-for-judge-kavanaugh/,"The Editors of America Magazine have withdrawn their endorsement of Judge Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, arguing that even if he is innocent ìthis nomination is no longer in the best interests of the country.îìWhile we previously endorsed the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh on the basis of his legal credentials and his reputation as a committed textualist,î the editors of the Jesuit weekly state in their editorial Thursday, ìit is now clear that the nomination should be withdrawn.îThe issue has moved beyond Kavanaugh innocence or guilt, America contends, to the symbolic value of the case.ìIn addition to being a fight over policy issues, which it already was, his nomination has also become a referendum on how to address allegations of sexual assault,î they declare.The message from the Jesuit editors would seem to be: if any group or individual opposes a candidate for any public office and brings accusations located sufficiently far in the past as to be impossible to adjudicate, the ensuing cloud of uncertainty is sufficient to disqualify that candidate.The inevitable result of this line of reasoning is to push discussion away from candidatesí demonstrable credentials and to encourage attempts to discredit him or her through unverifiable accusations, presumably of a sexual nature.The editors argue that ideally Senate confirmation hearings might focus on evaluating a nomineeís judicial character or qualifications as a legal thinker. ìBut that time is long past.îIdeology has so suffused the political process that realism dictates playing by the same rules. ìNeither the country nor the court are well served by this arrangement, but refusing to recognize it does nothing to help reverse it,î the magazine states.ìWhat is different this time is that this nomination battle is no longer purely about predicting the likely outcome of Judge Kavanaughís vote on the court,î the editors state. ìIt now involves the symbolic meaning of his nomination and confirmation in the #MeToo era.îThe merits of the Kavanaugh case must yield to its symbolic significance for larger social trends, the editors suggest, and his nomination is just a casualty in this battle.ìThe hearings and the committeeís deliberations are now also a bellwether of the way the country treats women when their reports of harassment, assault and abuse threaten to derail the careers of powerful men,î they state.The editors fail to address the compelling line of argumentation of Kavanaugh himself, who shows the other side of the coin.In his letter to the committee of the Judiciary, Kavanaugh claims that the accusations made against him ìare smears, pure and simple. And they debase our public discourse.îìBut they are also a threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country,î he adds. ìSuch grotesque and obvious character assassinationóif allowed to succeedówill dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service.îIn their editorial, the Jesuits choose not to entertain this very probable fallout from the case, preferring to focus on Kavanaughís inability to disprove the charges.Since Dr. Blaseyís accusations have not been ìconclusively disproved or shown to be less than credible,î it is time for ìKavanaughís nomination to be withdrawn,î they state.Kavanaughís failure to conclusively disprove his guilt, America claims, is sufficient grounds to retire his nomination. Here, the presumption of innocence does not hold.Which is, if nothing else, a sad commentary on the state of the Jesuits and their willingness to betray any principle for the sake of expedience.Follow Thomas D.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/09/28/late-night-hosts-rip-into-ahole-brett-kavanaugh-praise-christine-fords-testimony/,"Late-night comedians ripped into President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday evening, while praising Dr. Christine Fordís testimony as she alleged sexual assault at the hands of Kavanaugh from over 30 years ago.On†The Daily Show,†Trevor Noah described the testimonies as ìthe only story anyone was talking about today,î before focusing in on a†clip of Dr. Ford describing intricate parts of her brain.ìOh snap! Oh! People were asking how ëthe ladyí can trust her brain, turns out sheís a brain scientist,î Noah said. ìThose senators were probably like, ëOh yes, weíre also familiar with the hippopotamus. We all know that Ö letís move on, letís move on.îHe went on to attack Kavanaugh for being angry and emotional.ìI donít know if heís got something going on in his life, but he seemed really angry,î Noah said.†ìGood lord, this guy such an asshole he looked like he was auditioning for a Snickers commercial.îThe Late Show,†Stephen Colbert suggested it had been ìthe most divisive day in America since Laurel and Yanny, if Yanny was trying to get on the Supreme Court and Laurel had some really disturbing stories to tell about him.îì[Christine Ford] went first, and her testimony†was deeply moving,î Colbert continued. ìDonít take my word for it, ask the liberal snowflakes over at Fox News.îOver on Live!, Jimmy Kimmel said the hearings made for emotional television, while also praising Fordís helpful demeanor.ìPeople were crying in front of their televisions so hard youíd have thought Milo Ventimiglia got killed by a crock pot,î he joked. ìShe was everything the Democrats hoped she would be. She was polite, likable and well-spoken. Maybe more than anything, it was striking to see someone questioned before the Senate who actually answered questions. I think thatís a first.îSeth Meyers of†Late Night†also weighed in on Fordís description of how the brain works.ìSheís in the middle of testifying in the intense glare of the national spotlight about an alleged sexual assault committed by a Supreme Court nominee and she just taught everyone how the brain works,î he quipped. ìShe gave a detailed anatomy of the hippocampus and the memory centers in the brain to a room of guys who look like they eat brains.îMeyers also took issue with how Kavanaugh described the testimony as a ìpolitical hit.îìHoly shit, Iím surprised he didnít start attacking George Washington. ëIf heís so honest, why does he wear a wig?'î Meyers joked. ìRepublicans always act like theyíre in a slasher film and the killer around the corner is Hillary Clinton.îThe Tonight Showës Jimmy Fallon suggested that Trump realized ìit wasnít going wellî while watching the testimony aboard Air Force One.ìTrump watched the hearing while flying on Air Force One,î he said. ìYou could tell it wasnít going well because halfway through Trump tried to walk outside to get some air.îFollow Ben Kew on†Facebook, Twitter at†@ben_kew,†or†email him at bkew@breitbart.com.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/patrick-morrisey-joe-manchin-complicit-in-senate-democrats-disgraceful-treatment-of-brett-kavanaugh/,"West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey said in a statement on Friday that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) is complicit in the Senate Democratsí ìdisgraceful treatmentî of Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.Morrisey slammed Senate Democratsí tactics to disrupt and defame Judge Kavanaugh during the Supreme Court nomination process. The West Virginia Republican contended that the Democratic senator was complicit in Senate Judiciary ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumerís (D-NY) strategy to prevent Kavanaugh from joining the nationís highest court.ìRegardless of how he votes, Joe Manchin has proven to be complicit in Senate Democratsí disgraceful treatment†of President Trumpís Supreme Court pick,î said Morrisey. ìThe voters of West Virginia can fully expect the resist†and obstruct circus to be unleashed if Joe Manchin, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, and Maxine Waters take control of Congress.îSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) slammed Feinstein in a fiery speech on Thursday that the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh amount to ìthe most unethical sham since Iíve been in politics.îKavanaugh, in his opening statement on Thursday, lambasted Senate Democrats for turning the Supreme Court nomination process into a political witchhunt. Kavanaugh†said, ìThis confirmation process has become a national disgrace Ö You have replaced ëadvice and consentí with ësearch and destroy.íîSen. Manchin faces immense pressure to confirm Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. A September poll found that 51 percent of West Virginians, 50 percent of West Virginia independents, and 45 percent of West Virginia want Kavanaugh confirmed for the Supreme Court.A survey released on Thursday found that Manchin and Morrisey are now tied for the West Virginia Senate race.In contrast to Manchin, Morrisey led a 26-state coalition of Attorneys General urging the confirmation of Kavanaugh.Morrisey contended that Sen. Manchin has followed Schumerís orders on Judge Kavanaugh since the beginning of the confirmation process. Twenty-three minutes after President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, Schumer said he will oppose Kavanaughís nomination ìwith everything I haveî because the ìstakes are simply too high.îImmediately after Manchin left his meeting with Kavanaugh, the West Virginia Democrat went straight to Schumerís office.Schumer suggested that vulnerable Senate Democrats hold off on their decision whether to support Donnelly as long as possible.Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL)†said, ìAll Chuck ever says in caucus [meetings], itís pretty well known: ëKeep your powder dry. Donít commit. Stay as neutral as you can, as long as you can.îMorrisey contended that Manchin holding his vote until the last-minute has given Schumer room to maneuver, and hopefully, tank the nominee.Morrisey charged, ìThe bottom line, Manchin should be ashamed for giving Schumer and Senate Democrats the ëroom to maneuverí to ultimately try to destroy President Trumpís Supreme Court nominee.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/joe-manchin-feels-the-heat-stand-with-california-liberals-or-protect-wv-gun-rights-by-voting-for-kavanaugh/,"Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) is under pressure now that Brett Kavanaugh has spoken in his own defense, leaving the Senator with the choice of voting for a SCOTUS nominee who will defend West Virginianís gun rights or ignoring West Virginians to stand with California liberals.Making the pressure even greater is the fact that President Trump will be holding a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia on Saturday. West Virginians voted for pro-gun Trump over anti-gun Hillary Clinton by a percentage of roughly 70 to 30, which means the residents of the state have already chosen protection of the Second Amendment over liberalism.Moreover, Manchin is in a tough race. His pro-gun opponent, Patrick Morrisey, is tied with him in polls and Morrisey has not been shy about pointing out the fact that Manchin has been rejected by the NRA.Manchinís NRA rating is a D.Manchin came into office via a 2010 special election. He campaigned as defender of West Virginia gun rights only to become one of the Democratsí staunchest gun control proponents in late 2012. Following the December 14, 2012, attack on Sandy Hook Elementary, Manchin had garnered enough favor with Barack Obama that PBS†reported†he was chosen as gun control point man for Obamaís White House.Although the Sandy Hook attack was carried out with stolen firearms, Manchinís response was more background checks for retail sales. Making matters worse, Manchin†admitted†his gun controls would not have prevented Sandy Hook from occurring in the first place, yet he was willing to spend all his political capital to secure it.AWR†Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host†of the Breitbart podcast†Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of†Down Range with AWR Hawkins,†a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/28/turley-kavanaugh-changed-things-at-hearing-when-he-attacked-the-democrats/,"Friday on ìFox & Friends,î George Washington Law professor Jonathan Turley weighed in on Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh hearing from the day before and said the Supreme Court nominee did ìa lot of good for himselfî with how he handled his questioning.Turley began by saying had the vote been after his accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, gave her testimony, Kavanaugh would likely not have received enough votes to be confirmed because she was ìvery compelling.îHowever, Turley said Kavanaugh came out strong and attacked Democrats for mishandling the confirmation process, which he said ìchanged that dynamic.îì[I]nstead of attacking [Ford], he attacked the Democrats,î said Turley. ìThat was very effective for the right group of people. Itís not going to change the mind of people who believe Dr. Ford, but I think it did spark the base and theyíre going to have their voices heard this morning.îFollow Trent Baker on Twitter†@MagnifiTrent

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/09/28/cnn-chris-cuomo-brett-kavanaugh-virgin-yale/,"CNNís Chris Cuomo asked a female classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh if he was ìknown at Yale as a virginî in a Thursday evening interview.The far-left anchor for the cable news channel asked this embarrassing question of Lynne Brookes, who attended Yale with Kavanaugh.ìI donít believe itís disqualifying to have partied in high school or in college,î Cuomo said. ìBut him telling the truth about himself is a more relevant standard. Was Brett Kavanaugh known at Yale as a virgin?î†What pic.twitter.com/XwGbhkDW2Wó Jimmy (@JimmyPrinceton) September 28, 2018Brookes, who was obviously caught off guard by the inappropriate and personal question, could only respond: ìI have no idea.îThen, as if to make her even more uncomfortable, Cuomo let her hang for a beat before he managed to stammer out, ìI just want to know because thatís something he points out about himself that I know, having gone to the same school.îCuomo then questioned the honesty of Brookes by telling her, ìItís not so big a school, Itís got a big name. But itís not that big a community. Itís pretty small. Itís the kind of thing that would have been known.îApparently, Cuomo knows just how sexually active every single one of his classmates was. Thousands of students attend Yale. Who could or would put in the effort to know such a thing?Newsbusters reports that later in the show, the deeply partisan Cuomo ìragedî against Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) for defending Kavanaugh at Thursdayís Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.ìWhat the hell is he so angry about? What is going on with Lindsey Graham?î Cuomo asked rhetorically, before shaming Graham for not appearing on his basement-rated show. ìI keep inviting him on the show to make the case.îCuomo then instructed Graham about who he is supposed to be angry with, and it was not the Senate Democrats who created this fiasco.ìHe should be angry at the people to his left and right from his own party,î Cuomo demanded. ìIf you want to get red in the face, it should be with shame that you should own, Senator, and the people in your party who put it to this point.îThis is not the first time Cuomo has exposed a creepy side. Last year, he argued that a 12-year-old girl made uncomfortable by the sight of a penis in a girlís locker room needs to learn ìtolerance.î When it comes to Cuomo pushing his far-left agenda, a womanís or even a little girlís consent no longer matters.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/report-prosecutor-rachel-mitchell-would-not-charge-kavanaugh-or-even-pursue-a-search-warrant/,"Arizona sex crimes prosecutor†Rachel Mitchell told Republican senators in a†conference meeting Thursday evening that she would not charge Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after hearing testimonies of the Judge or his accuser Christine Blasey Ford.Mitchell, who took a leave of absence from†Maricopa Countyís Deputy County Attorney and division chief the County Attorneyís Officeís Special Victims Division to join the Senate†Judiciary Committeeís team of attorneys for the hearing, ìbroke down her analysisî of both testimonies to GOP lawmakers. In a nearly 30-minute presentation, Mitchell went over the ìfacts that were established and not establishedî and concluded that not only would she not charge Kavanaugh based on the record of evidence from both parties, but would not even pursue a search warrant for the judge, which in virtually all cases would require the standard of probable cause†to be met, Politico reported.Brooke Singman of Fox News quoted one source as saying ìMitchell was very clear with senators that based on evidence presented, she couldnít bring the case ëanywhere near a court room.'îIn a day like few others in Senate history, California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford quietly recounted her ì100 percentî certainty Thursday that President Donald Trumpís nominee for the Supreme Court had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers ó and then Brett Kavanaugh defiantly testified he was ì100 percent certainî he did no such thing.That left senators to decide whether the long day of testimony tipped their confirmation votes for or against Trumpís nominee in a deeply partisan fight with the future of the high court and possibly control of Congress in the balance.Showing their own certainty, Republicans quickly scheduled a recommendation vote for Friday morning in the Senate Judiciary Committee, where they hold an 11-10 majority. They are hoping for a final Senate roll call next week, seating Kavanaugh on the court shortly after the October start of its new term.In the committeeís packed hearing room Thursday, for hours upon hours, both Kavanaugh and Ford said the alleged assault and the storm of controversy that has erupted 36 years later had altered their lives forever and for the worse.Ford recounted for the senators of the alleged assault in a locked room at a gathering of friends when she was just 15. The memory ó and alleged ìuproarious laughterî during the act ó was ìlockedî in her brain, she said. Ford delivered her testimony with deliberate certitude, though admitting gaps in her memory as she choked back tears at some points and said she ìbelieved he was going to rape me.î All of Fordís named witnesses, including high school close friend†Leland Keyser, denied having any knowledge of the alleged incident. The 53-old professor says she does not know the date or location of the alleged incident.Hours later, Kavanaugh passionately denied her allegation, striking a defiant tone and choking up several times, particularly when discussing his family. He decried his confirmation opposition as a ìnational disgrace.îìYou have replaced ëadvice and consentí with ësearch and destroy,íî he said, citing the Constitutionís language defining senatorsí duties in confirming high officials.Kavanaugh, who has two daughters, said one of his girls said they should ìpray for the womanî making the allegations against him, referring to Ford. ìThatís a lot of wisdom from a 10-year-old,î he said. ìWe mean no ill will.îFollowing Kavanaughís testimony, President Trump tweeted in support of the judge, making clear that he was standing shoulder to shoulder with his nominee. ìHis testimony was powerful, honest and riveting,î the president wrote. ìThe Senate must vote!îThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/nolte-christine-blasey-ford-brought-no-evidence-but-plenty-of-contradictions/,"Christine Blasey Ford, the woman accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attempting to sexually assault her in 1982 when they were both teenagers, sounded credible to a lot of people. Even those who want to see Kavanaugh confirmed are writing and talking about how credible she sounded, how real and raw.At the risk of sounding callous ó So what? Now that we live in this Orwellian world where if you do not express the CorrectThink, your humanity is suspect, maybe people are saying this because that is what we are supposed to say. Well, all I know is that I did not find her at all credible ó and I am not going to say anything different.I certainly sympathized with Dr. Ford, and she did change my mind about one thing. I no longer believe she was part of a grand plan to destroy Kavanaugh. Rather, I do believe she wanted to remain anonymous, I do believe she is a victim of the Senate Democrats who re-victimized a woman who has already been damaged in some terrible way.But was she a credible witness, believableÖ?Not even close.Even what Dr. Ford remembers doesnít add up.According to Dr. Ford: She attended a house party miles from her home. She had one beer. There were four or five other people at the party, including her best friend, Leland Ingham Keyser. Brett (Kavanaugh) and Mark (Judge) were already drunk and belligerent. She went upstairs to use the bathroom. Suddenly she was attacked from behind and shoved into a bedroom. Brett and Mark turned the music up so no one would hear her scream as they attempted to rape her. She got away. Locked herself in a bathroom. She waited until it was safe; until she heard Brett and Mark ìping pongî off the walls down the stairs. After it was safe, she ran down the stairs and left the house. She cannot remember who drove her to the party or how she got home.The only way her story adds up is if you are trying to weave the stuff of Kafka, where the accused cannot grab hold of something to clear himself, not even with an alibi because there is no where or when. In this respect, it is all a tad too neat.As harrowing as her story is, upon close examination, nothing about it makes any sense.Then we come to the most damaging elements, the facts and contradictions that actually do undermine Dr. Fordís credibility:And soÖHow Christine Blasey Ford can sound credible to anyone interested in facts, consistency, corroboration, witness testimony, fairness, due process, the Constitution, or evidence is beyond my comprehension.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Rick Scott. One September poll had both Scott and Nelson receiving 47 percent of the vote, while a recent NBC News/Marist poll had Nelson up three points in the Florida Senate race.Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) decided last week that she will vote against Kavanaugh, suggesting that Kavanaughís alleged beliefs on campaign finance reform disqualifies him from the Supreme Court. The Missouri Democrat admitted that Fordís sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh was ìtroubling,î although it did not play a factor in her decision.Nelson, McCaskill, and Jonesí early decision on Kavanaugh drives a stark contrast against other red-state Senate Democrats such as Sens. Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), and Jon Tester (D-MT), who could all end up voting in favor of Kavanaughís nomination. These Senate Democrats face competitive races against their Republican challengers, and they hope to get re-elected in states that President Donald J. Trump won handily.Nelsonís vote planned vote against Kavanaugh might backfire as reports from Thursday night suggested that Sens. Donnelly, Manchin, Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Susan Collins (R-ME) all plans to vote the same way, giving Kavanaugh a potential bipartisan majority to confirm him, and would alienate red-state voters against the Florida Democrat.Donnelly, Manchin, Murkowski and Collins are all expected to vote the same way, per senators and aidesó Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 28, 2018

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/28/blue-state-blues-the-democrats-absurd-fbi-obsession/,"Democrats tried to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaughís credibility on Thursday, and block his confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court, by questioning why he would not join them in demanding that the Federal Bureau or Investigation (FBI) conduct a supposedly ìnonpartisanî and ìindependentî inquiry into Christine Blasey Fordís recent claim that he groped her in high school, over 35 years ago.It was the one effective point of attack ó and the one question on which Kavanaugh looked somewhat weak. He said in his stirring opening statement ó which will enter the history books as one of the great moments in American oratory ó that he welcomed an FBI investigation.Yet Democrats ignored that and pressed forward as if he had never said that. The execrable Sen Dick Durbin (D-IL) demanded, finger wagging and all, that Kavanaugh tell White House Counsel Don McGahn to stop the confirmation process ó as if the president controls the Senate, and the judge controls the president ó until the FBI could investigate.Kavanaugh was repeatedly forced to defend the Senate Judiciary Committeeís decision as if it were his own. It fell to Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to point out, in his equally memorable speech, that committee Democrats could have approached Republicans to demand an FBI investigation when they first learned about Dr. Fordís claims in July, but instead chose to hold them in reserve and leak them later, damaging both the accuser and the accused.Still, why not now? Kavanaugh tried to explain that the FBI would not, and could not, tell the committee more than it already knew. He noted that every possible witness had already submitted statements under oath, all contradicting Dr. Fordís claims; that the FBI does not reach conclusions or make recommendations when it investigates judicial nominees; and that the ten daysí delay between his request for a hearing to clear his name ó a delay partly caused, he might have added, by Dr. Fordís lawyers misleading the committee about her fear of flying ó had been worse than hell for him and his family.Committee chair Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) also quoted then-Sen. Joe Biden (D-DE) ó twice ó telling the committee during the Clarence Thomas hearings in 1991 that the FBIís assessment was worthless as a determination of the facts and that it was up to the committee to arrive at its own conclusions.Yet Dr. Fordís refusal to join Democrats in calling for another investigation made it look, at least to those inclined to disbelieve him, as though he had something to hide.†And he did ó though it was nothing to be ashamed of: Kavanaugh was ìhidingî the fact that he wants the job.He also knows full well that every hour of delay reduces his chances of success, because the Michael Avenattis of the world have instant access to cable news studios; because if Democrats can push a vote off until after the midterm elections, they may delay it indefinitely; and because the moderate Republicans in whose hands his fate rests are generally too cowardly to stand up to sustained pressure.Perhaps Kavanaugh also suspects that no investigation will be enough for Democrats who think fart jokes in high school yearbooks are relevant to determining his credibility. (They did not ask Dr. Ford about her yearbooks.)But there is something even more absurd about involving the FBI at this stage of the confirmation process, and it was not mentioned by anyone in the hearing room on Thursday. Namely: the idea that the FBI could be considered ìnon-partisanî or ìindependentî is a joke after all we have learned about its role in the 2016 presidential election.Yes, some of the bad apples are gone. But it is far too soon for Americans to feel comfortable about the agencyís integrity. Any conclusion ó even one that supported Kavanaugh ó would instantly be seen as a result of partisan bias. That is why FBI Director Christopher Wray has wisely sought to keep his agency out of this particular fight.Moreover, while the FBI does provide information on judicial candidates to the White House and Senate, asking it to intervene at this late stage is the same as asking it to determine the outcome. That violates the separation of powers by outsourcing the Senateís constitutional responsibility to the executive branch and law enforcement.More than two years ago, the FBI threw an election, and the country, into turmoil. After all we have been through, the fact that Democrats still want the FBI to make major political decisions is beyond absurd. It is frightening.Joel B.

All in the name of a blood sport called partisan politics, played by the most dishonest vipers ever found under the earth.The only bright speck in the whole circus of Judge Brett Kavanaughís confirmation hearings has been the honorable behavior of Republicans on the SenateJudiciary Committee. Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, bent over backward to accommodate a woman who came forward with alarming accusations against Judge Kavanaugh.She was given a full, thorough and respectful hearing to level her serious accusations.Though her claims are strenuously disputed, entirely uncorroborated and riddled with inconsistencies and shifting versions, the woman deserved to make her case. Mr. Grassley made sure she was able to.She was not shouted down by protesters. She was not silenced. Nobody called her a murderer.We have come a long way since Paula Jones was called a liar and trailer-park trash by Bill Clintonís war dogs after she accused the then-governor of exposing himself to her and sexually harassing her. Those charges were corroborated, and Mrs. Jones was ultimately vindicated.But James Carvilleís disgusting treatment of her could never be erased.Mr. Grassley does not play those vile games. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about others.Over the past two weeks, sitting senators have publicly and enthusiastically denounced the single most fundamental tenet of fairness in America: the notion that an accused person is presumed innocent until proved guilty.Judge†Kavanaugh†was accused of a very serious crime. Instead of being allowed to rebut the charges and clear his name, the accusations were allowed to sit and fester like a dead body rotting inside an upstairs room of an un-air-conditioned house in the Southern heat.By the time the authorities arrived, the body was unrecognizable. Judge†Kavanaugh†had deformed into a monster.It is little wonder.As soon as Judge†Kavanaugh†was nominated, Democrats warned that women would suffer and millions would die if he was elevated to the Supreme Court.During his confirmation hearings, Sen. Cory Booker, New Jersey Democrat, set the tone of the ridiculous circus, excitedly declaring it his ìëI am Spartacus!í moment.îNo, sir, Mr. Booker. You are not Spartacus ó except in that you will ultimately lose.You are Caligula.You wear your silly Roman toga, whipping up this bacchanalia of personal destruction. This orgy of leaks and lies and smears and innuendo. This debauched festival of political grandstanding, self-adulation and senatorial fornication.Say it now, Mr. Booker: ìI am Caligula!îThen came Judge†Kavanaugh. He refused to back down from the bullies. He remained to defend himself, his sterling reputation, his strong wife, his wonderfully decent daughters and his family.He torched the†committee, the entire†Senate, the whole confirmation process with a ferocious in-your-face rebuke the likes of which sitting senators rarely endure.He absolutely filleted them all. The most touching moments of his testimony were about when he was a boy, trying to become a good man. Like his father. Who kept calendars. To remember things. But also to entertain the family with treasured memories.Democrats on the†committee†not only tried to destroy a man. They tried to destroy the boy he once was.When Judge†Kavanaugh†was finished, Democrats on the†committee†looked like scalded dogs. Staffers sat in back with stony faces.They were left with nothing but questions about how much Judge†Kavanaugh†likes to drink beer, what he wrote in his high school yearbook and flatulence.Caligulaís quiver was empty. His sword bent.All that is left now are loud clanging noises as Caligula exits the arena, vanquished.<U+2981>†Contact Charles Hurt at†churt@washingtontimes.com†or on Twitter @charleshurt.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/contentious-judiciary-committee-vote-looms-as-kavanaugh-survives-senates-ford-hearing/,"Judge Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trumpís second nominee to the United States Supreme Court, survived a contentious hearing on Thursday in which he defended against allegations of sexual impropriety leveled at him earlier in the day by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford from more than three decades ago.Now, in the wake of the hearing, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Friday morning on Kavanaughís confirmationñthe first in a series of three tests the federal appellate judge must pass before taking a seat among the other eight Justices on the U.S. Supreme Court.The committee has 21 members, 11 Republicans and ten Democrats. All ten Judiciary Committee Democrats are expected to oppose Kavanaughís nomination. Ten of the Judiciary Committee Republicans are likely or confirmed yes votes for Kavanaugh, with just oneñSen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ)ñuncertain at this point, even though Flake has signaled in the direction of being in favor of the nomination.During the contentious Thursday hearings, Flakeñtoward the very end of Kavanaughís impassioned testimony, which came after Fordís earlier appearanceñmade brief comments suggesting he had not come down on the matter either way.ìWhen Dr. Ford came forward with her account, I immediately said that she should be heard and asked the chairman to delay the vote that we had scheduled,î Flake said during the hearing. ìThe chairman did, and I appreciate that. She came, at great difficulty for her, and offered compelling testimony.îWATCH: SEN. FLAKE DURING SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARING:Flake continued, addressing Kavanaugh directly:You have come and done the same. I am sorry for whatís happened to you and your family, as I am sorry for what has happened to hers. This is not a good process, but itís all weíve got. I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that in the end, we are 21 very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent and in the end there is likely to be as much doubt as certainty going out of this room today. As we make decisions going forward, I hope people will recognize that the rhetoric that we use and in the language that we use going forward that we will recognize that there is doubtñweíll never move beyond thatñand that we just have a real humility on that front.Earlier in the hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) made his own passionate plea for senators not to fall for the traps being laid by Democrats. In part of it, Graham made a plea directly to his fellow Republicansñand specifically to Flake.WATCH SEN. GRAHAM DURING SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARING:ìTo my Republican colleagues, if you vote no,î Graham said while looking directly at Flake, ìyou are legitimizing the most despicable thing I have seen in my entire time in politics.îGraham was looking DIRECTLY at Flake when he said ""my Republican colleagues"" ó Flake's arms were folded at his chest, he was looking down.ó Seung Min Kim (@seungminkim) September 27, 2018After the hearing concluded, Flake ended up meeting with other undecided senators in the fuller U.S. Senate, from both parties. He did not announce how he intends to vote, but he did meet with Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Joe Manchin (D-WV).HIGH DRAMA: Flake, Collins, Murkowski and Manchin ñ the senators who will determine whether Brett Kavanaugh gets a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court ñ are privately huddling NOW. @tedbarrettcnnó Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 27, 2018Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Jeff Flake and Joe Manchin are all meeting NOW before the GOP conference meeting, per @tedbarrettcnnó Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) September 27, 2018Flake reportedly remains split on how to vote ahead of Fridayís committee vote:SEN. FLAKE remains extremely torn about how heíll vote on Judge Kavanaughís nomination. He says he needs to review a lot before tomorrow morning, including sworn affidavits. Flake wishes GOP didnít rush through the process so senators could have more time to analyze.ó Marianna Sotomayor (@MariannaNBCNews) September 28, 2018But Flake also said the question is where the burden of proof liesñon the accused or the accuser. In Americaís judicial system, the burden is on the accuser and most certainly not the accusedñmeaning Flake seems to be leaning toward a yes vote:Flake is torn: ìThey both did well and he offered a defense like you would expect from someone who felt that they were wrongly accused. and she offered compelling testimony as well. But I have to go with what is the standard here. Where is the burden. Itís toughî @TheOtherKeppleró Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 28, 2018However, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), a Judiciary Committee Democrat, said on CNN during an interview with Chris Cuomo that ìI doî believe Flake is still in play, and argued that Flake should oppose the judgeís confirmation. But Coons also conceded that Manchinís vote, a key Democrat who could prove decisive in the confirmation process if he does decide to support Kavanaugh in the end, is also still in play, as Manchin keeps meeting with undecided GOP senators.Republicans, after the undecided senators concluded their meeting, headed into a caucus meeting with the entire GOP conference, where they then emerged and announced their plans to move forward with Fridayís committee vote.Assuming Kavanaugh gets through the committee voteñto which Flakeís eventual support is criticalñthen it would set up a timeline whereby procedural votes on the confirmation would occur over the weekend, and final confirmation would happen on the Senate floor next week.Senators emerging from meeting say plan is to vote Friday in committee and hold first procedural vote on floor on Kavanaugh nomination Saturday, teeing up confirmation vote next week. Important note: Itís not assured they have 50 votes yet but GOP leaders prepared to roll diceó Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 28, 2018It was after the committee vote announcement on Thursday evening from Senate Republicans that fellow undecided Republican Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), who earlier was one of the senators who had called for what became Thursdayís hearing, announced that Kavanaugh had won his vote in favor of his confirmation.I plan to vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh. My full statement: pic.twitter.com/LDj4epYyhcó Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) September 28, 2018Corkerís statement, as the Washington Postís Sean Sullivan noted, is a major positive indicator for Kavanaugh:Positive indicator for Kavanaugh: Sen.

If he clears the committee vote on Friday, that means Flake is a yes in committee, so he will be a yes on the floorñthus Kavanaugh has 49 yes votes at that point.Either Collins or Murkowskiñor a red state Democrat like Manchin or Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Jon Tester (D-MT), Doug Jones (D-AL), or Bill Nelson (D-FL)ñcould end it by announcing their vote to support Kavanaugh, providing him with the requisite bare minimum 50 votes in favor of confirmation. If only 50 senators vote yes, Vice President Mike Pence will be on standby to break the tie and the nomination would succeed 51-50 in a very tight vote.For Democrats to stop Kavanaugh on the floor at this point, they would need to hold at least two of the three remaining outstanding GOP votesñFlake, Collins, and Murkowskiñback and prevent every Democrat from voting for confirmation. On the floor, if the nomination gets there, it would already need to win Flakeís support in committee, so it is extraordinarily unlikely he would back it in committee and oppose it on the floor. Therefore, the Democrats could not afford for either Collins or Murkowski to support Kavanaugh.Itís also very unlikely that Democrats would be able to hold their own conference unified against Kavanaugh, given the fact that signs are already clearly emerging that Manchin is likely to vote for Kavanaughís confirmation as he faces a tough re-election battle back home in West Virginia:Interesting: A source close to Senator Manchin tells me now, ""Short of claims that definitively prove Dr. Ford's allegations or a realization that Kavanaugh will gut the healthcare law, Manchin will side with the overwhelming number of people in WV who want Kavanaugh confirmed.""ó Elaina Plott (@elainaplott) September 28, 2018Manchinís spokesman Jonathan Kott, however, said the senator remains undecided:Manchin spokesman Jonathan Kott: ""He is one-hundred percent undecided and remains so.""ó Elaina Plott (@elainaplott) September 28, 2018Even so, it has been expected all along that Manchin would vote to confirm Kavanaugh. In fact, his GOP opponent, Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, predicted in an interview with Breitbart News that Manchin would vote to confirm him. On Thursday, a new poll emerged showing Morrisey and Manchin tied at 45 percent apiece.Meanwhile, Murkowski has not signaled which way she is leaning yet but has said she is still considering everything:ìI'm going to go home, have dinner and have a chance to think about all that's gone on today,î Murkowski said, per @jeremyherb ìIt was long, it was detailed, it was very important to get it on the recordîó Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 28, 2018But another report suggests that Donnelly, Manchin, Murkowski, and Collins will vote as a bloc:Donnelly, Manchin, Murkowski and Collins are all expected to vote the same way, per senators and aidesó Burgess Everett (@burgessev) September 28, 2018That means that, assuming the news that Manchin intends to vote yes is correct, Kavanaugh has the votes necessary for confirmation at this time. In other words, according to at least one report, they all intend to vote for Kavanaughñmeaning if these reports are true, he has the votes necessary for confirmation:Sounds like theyíre all voting yes https://t.co/YI9dtJsCF9ó Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) September 28, 2018Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, has signaled the Senate is moving forward:.@senatemajldr McConnell, per @FoxReports: ìThe committee is going to vote in the morning and weíre going to move forward.î He did not answer when asked if Republicans had the votes. (They don't currently, but a lot can happen before Saturday.)ó Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) September 28, 2018McConnell also said he will ìproudlyî vote for Kavanaughís confirmation in a post-hearing statement:McConnell's stmt post-hearing: ""I Will Proudly Vote to Confirm Judge Kavanaugh""""No evidence corroborates Dr. Fordís allegation. No evidence was presented today to back it up.

John Thune (R-SD), expects that the vote will pass the committee:Sen. Thune, Senate GOP number 3, tells me heíd be ìsurprisedî if the Judiciary Committee didnít move forward on a Kavanaugh vote tomorrowó Phil Mattingly (@Phil_Mattingly) September 27, 2018Assuming the vote does pass the committee, the battle is only going to get more fierce as it heads to the full U.S. Senate and all senators debate the nomination on the floor over the weekend into next week.

There is no question that Kavanaugh is qualified to serve on the Supreme Court, and in a different political environment, he would be confirmed overwhelmingly.îìI believe Judge Kavanaugh has conducted himself as well as anyone could expect throughout this process and plan to vote to confirm him,î he added.I plan to vote to confirm Judge Brett Kavanaugh.

And when she said I am 100% sure who this was, I believe her. Itís up to them. Do they believe her?

Orrin Hatch†ó by adding contact†information including home phone numbers to Wikipedia.A Twitter bot that tracks Wikipedia edits from within Congress has revealed that someone from the U.S. House of Representatives and associated offices has been editing Wikipedia pages to dox Republican senators.The Twitter bot @Congress-Edits keeps track of all of the edits made to Wikipedia from IP addresses associated with the U.S. Congress. It revealed today that someone in the U.S. House of Representatives was adding the addresses, phone numbers (including in some cases home and cell numbers) and emails of Republican senators to their public Wikipedia pages.The first Republican Senator to be affected was Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC).https://twitter.com/congressedits/status/1045421240637419523Eight minutes later, the bot tweeted that similar edits had been made to the Wikipedia page of Sen.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/27/kavanaugh-to-feinstein-the-swetnick-thing-is-a-joke-that-is-a-farce/,"Judge Brett Kavanaugh had a heated exchange with Sen. Dianne Feinstein at Thursdayís Senate Judiciary Committee hearing addressing sexual misconduct allegations against him.Feinsteinís question session with Kavanaugh was contentious from the outset, with Kavanaugh repeatedly explaining that he was ready to defend himself against his accusersí allegations the day each were made. Things reached a boiling point, however, when Feinstein began talking about the lack of more involvement from FBI agents in the confirmation process.ìWe hear from the witness, but the FBI isnít interviewing them and isnít giving us any facts. So all we haveñ,î Feinstein began, when in a highly unusual move for a Senate hearing, an indignant Kavanaugh interrupted Feinstein.ìYouíre interviewing me. Youíre doing it senator. Iím sorry to interrupt, but youíre doing it. Thereís no conclusions reached,î Kavanaugh said.FBI nominee background investigations, like Judiciary Committee staff investigations, do not reach conclusions about guilt or innocence. They simply collect evidence for senators to use in making their decisions.When Feinsteinís questioning turned to the heart of the matter, things were no less tense.ìWhat youíre saying, if I understand it, is that the allegations by Dr. Ford, Miss Ramirez, and Miss Swetnick are wrong,î Feinstein said to Kavanaugh, who in his more than half-hour opening statement denied all allegations of sexual misconduct levied against him, including detailed denials of the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, the only accuser present at Thursdayís hearing.Julie Swetnick, the third of Kavanaughís accusers and client of ìResistanceî lawyer Michael Avenatti, made the most aggregious allegations against him. Through Avenatti, she claimed Kavanaugh, three years her junior, was part of a gang of prep school boys who routinely drugged and then gang raped young girls in the Washington, DC, area for years in the 1980s.ìThat is emphatically what Iím saying. Emphatically,î Kavanaugh said in response to Feinstein. ìThe Swetnick thing is a joke, that is a farce!îìWould you like to say more about it?î Feinstein asked.A sharp ìNo.î was Kavanaughís only response.With some of her five minutes still remaining, Feinstein ended her questioning, passing the floor back to Arizona sex crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell. As in Thursday morningís testimony from Ford, Mitchell questioned Kavanaugh for each of the 11 Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Weíve seen a lot of it today. The stories from Professor Ford and her family, what theyíve been through and the story about Judge Kavanaughís daughters, talking about praying for Professor Ford and Ashley Kavanaughís face while he was telling that story and Brett Kavanaugh crying every time he talked about his parents and his wife and his kids and all his friends, men and women. Thatís the ëhuman carnageí that Donald Trump promised in his inauguration address.îThe line was a misquote, both in content and in context, of Trumpís inaugural speech. Rather than ìpromiseî carnage in the future, Trump said that the ìcarnageî of crime, poverty, and drugs ìstops right here and stops right now.îAmericans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves.These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public.But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.Wallace continued: ìA couple things I learned about how this speech came to be, Brett Kavanaugh ripped up a set of remarks that have been circulated for feedback and notes and approval yesterday. He wrote this himself. I heard from two sources close to Kavanaugh that this was not a performance that had anything to do with the Supreme Court. Itís a performance that had to do with his life. And I say ëperformanceí because I knew Brett Kavanaugh for ó I worked with him in the White House for years and I never saw that side of him. So it was authentic and real. It may not have helped him.îThe MSNBC anchor then said that Kavanaughís passionate defense may have damaged the perception†of his testimony: ìIt may have hurt him. It may have helped him. But it was raw emotion, and Iíve never seen that side of him. It was a rebuke of this moment in politics, and I think the question now is, does that overlap with his legislative goals, which is to win enough votes on this Committee to have his nomination forwarded to the full Senate? And I have no idea.î

She came across as a real human being, just telling her story. And then of course listening to Judge Kavanaugh and it was surprising to me that he seemed like a bully, frankly, and it reminds meóit took me back to my old days as a victimís advocate working with victims of domestic violence and sexual assault and seeing their perpetrators across the table or across the courtroom and that kind of confrontation and it really felt very much like that. And so I was struck. I was struck by the fact that he kept interrupting the Democratic senators. It was unbelievable, in fact. And he showed the most interruption I think to some of the women members of that Senate panel. And then, of course, he would not answer the question ever about submitting to or making a request to the White House for an FBI investigation. And I think that that was damning. I think that if he believes his truth, then he should want to submit that so that he could enter the court, if heís going to do that, without anything hanging over his term, and he is unwilling to do that, and that suggests to me that he doesnít want to find out the answers to that question, and he doesnít want the rest of us to find out either.îShe added, ìHe sort of modeled if you will, the man who nominated him, President Trump. He was very belligerent and angry, and clearly, there were emotional moments talking about his family. I imagine it would be difficult for your family to hear about this testimony and what I was shocked by is that at the end the fact that he actually did not watch Christine Fordís testimony.

One of them would be to ask for an FBI investigation of every serious charge leveled against him, not just by Dr. Ford but for others. He could ask for his longtime friend Mark Judge to come forward and testify under oath and be cross-examined. Heís not done either one of those things. Every time heís given an opportunity to do that, which would not just be a thing that would speak to his confidence, but it would also be a politically strong move, he demurs in one way or another and defers back to the Republican-controlled committee.îHe continued, ìThe reality of this day is we walked into the hearing with a couple of keyóthis is a numbers game, right? Most of the Republicans are going to vote for him no matter what. Most of the Democrats, all Democrats are going to vote against him, no matter what. There are a handful of Republican senators, the notable ones obviously Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, but some others, probably up to maybe ten at the most, who are going to look at this hearing and make a decision about what they thought at the end of it. Given the strength of Dr. Fordís testimony and given the different Brett Kavanaugh that we saw in the second half of the hearing that weíve seen so far, it does not look to me like he designed his testimony and his demeanor to try to play to those people and their concerns. He may be making Donald Trump happy. He may be making the Republican base happy. What he is not doing is reassuring Senator Collins, reassuring Senator Murkowski, reassuring Jeff Flake and Bob Corker and some others who are the ones who hold the fate of this nomination in his hands. It looks much more to me like he has decided to defend his honor and try to portray himself as a martyr in some basic knowledge that he is probably now unlikely to get confirmed because the way this day has gone has made it very hard for those Republican senators in the middle to be for him.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Ted Lieu (D-CA) took to Twitter on Thursday to ridicule Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as he testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in response to testimony from Christine Blasey Ford, who alleged that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her at a high school party in the early 1980s.Kavanaugh, who has also been accused of sexual misconduct by two other women and whose name has been dragged through the mud over the allegations, was emotional as he again categorically denied all of the charges and described how the ordeal had devastated his family.Kavanaugh was near tears on several occasionsduring his testimony, as was his wife Ashley, who sat behind him in the hearing room.ìIf Brett Kavanaugh can be this angry on national TV, imagine what heís like when he gets inebriated,î Lieu tweeted.†If Brett Kavanaugh can be this angry on national TV, imagine what he's like when he gets inebriated.#KavanaughHearings https://t.co/jqszfqb8Fqó Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) September 27, 2018Lieu then retweeted other tweets disparaging Kavanaugh as he was testifying.ìInstead we can see the mean drunkÖ and heís sober #KavanaughConfirmation,î Rosalind Chao tweeted.Instead we can see the mean drunkÖ and heís sober #KavanaughConfirmation https://t.co/dLYotmLZLzó Rosalind Chao (@rosalindchao) September 27, 2018ìSo, did that work for women?

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/kavanaugh-i-fear-the-whole-country-will-reap-the-whirlwind-of-democrats-behavior/,"Judge Brett Kavanaugh accused Democrats and the left at Thursdayís Senate Judiciary Committee hearing of having created a dangerous precedent for the country in trying to defeat his nomination with last-minute, decades-old, uncorroborated sexual misconduct allegations.ìThis confirmation process has become a national disgrace,î Kavanaugh said close to the beginning of his opening statement, where he gave a scathing assessment of how Democrats came to unveil the allegations against him. He quoted†Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) saying those who support Kavanaugh are ìcomplicit in evilî and former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz asserting that confirming Kavanaugh would endanger millions of lives.Kavanaugh told the committe:I understand the passions of the moment. But I would say to those senators, ëYour words have meaning.í Millions of Americans listened carefully to you. Given comments like those, is it any surprise that people have been willing to do anything, to make any physical threat against my family, to send any violent email to my wife? To make any kind of allegation against me and against my friends? To blow me up and take me down?Kavanaugh hinted that he believed the Democratic strategy to defeat his nomination will have lasting effects on the political system. ìYou sowed the wind. For decades to come, I fear the whole country will reap the whirlwind,î he said.He referenced the widely-criticized treatment Democratic senators subjected to Ronald Reaganís Supreme Court nominee Judge Robert Bork. ìThe behavior of several of the Democratic members of this committee at my hearing a few weeks ago was an embarrassment, but at least it was just a good old-fashioned attempt at borking,î he said, continuing:Those efforts didnít work. When I did at least okay enough at the hearings that it looked as though I might actually get confirmed, a new tactic was needed. Some of you were lying in wait and had it ready. This first allegation was held in secret for weeks by a Democratic member of this committee and by staff. It would be needed only if you couldnít take me out on the merits.Kavanaughís opening statement set off a combative hearing, with Kavanaugh aggressively refuting both the allegations made against him with committee witness Christine Blasey Ford and those of other accusers not present.

In the summer of 1982, my job was cutting lawns. I had my own business of sorts.

I played in a lot of summer league basketball games for the Georgetown Prep team at night at Blair High School in Silver Spring. Many nights I worked out with other guys at Tobinís house, he was the great quarterback on our football team, and his dad ran workouts, or lifted weights at Georgetown Prep in preparation for the football season.After deleting the tweet, Hohmann denied that he meant to insinuate Kavanaghís weightlifting gave him the strengthen to allegedly pin down his accuser.One of my earlier tweets was interpreted in a way that was not intended so I deleted it.ó James Hohmann (@jameshohmann) September 27, 2018According to Ford, Kavanaugh and his friend Mike Judge†forced her into a bedroom and proceeded to grope her and try to undress her.

Graham noted that 23 minutes after President Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, Sen.

He had a hard time because he was so drunk and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes.ìI believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming,î the professor continued.ìThis was what terrified me the most and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me,î she added.Ford†testified she did not reveal the alleged incident to her parents, citing concerns they would react angrily that she attended a house party where alcohol was present. Further, the professor, who did not file a police report following the alleged misconduct, contended she only first detailed the incident during a couplesí therapy session in May 2012.Ford alleges that Kavanaugh, along with his friend Mike Judge, forced her into a room and groped her at a house party in Maryland around 1982, an accusation all named witnesses deny any knowledge of.With his wife, Ashley, by his side, Judge Kavanaugh denied the allegation in a sit-down interview with†Fox Newsís Martha MacCallum on Monday and called for a ìfair processî in which he could defend his integrity†against the claims.ìIíve never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise,î President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court nominee affirmed to†MacCallum. ìI am not questioning, and have not questioned, that perhaps Dr. Ford, at some point in her life, was sexually assaulted by someone, in some place.

Crazy stuff, gangs, illegitimate children, fights on boats in Rhode Island, all nonsense, reported breathlessly and often uncritically by the media.îHe continued, ìThis has destroyed my family and my good name, a good name built up through decades of very hard work and public service at the highest levels of the American government. This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.îFollow Ian†Hanchett on Twitter†@IanHanchett

Cory Booker (D-NJ) that supporting Kavanaugh meant being ìcomplicit in evil.î Others, he noted, said that†ìpeople will die if I am confirmed.îThe campaign to stop his confirmation, he said, had ìdestroyed my good name and my familyî through a†ìcalculated and orchestrated political hit.îWhatever the reason, ó whether fueled by ìpent-up angerî over the election, or for other motives ó he decried the damage done to him, to the Supreme Court, and to the country.ìThis is a circus. The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades,î he said.However, he vowed:ìCoordinated and well-funded effort to destroy my good name, and destroy my family, will not drive me out.îìYou may defeat me in the final vote, but youíll never get me to quit. Never.îKavanaugh also repeated his denials about any and all allegations of sexual assault.†He seemed to choke up when mentioning his mother, a judge who inspired him to become a judge.

She claims to have walked out of the bathroom where she hid after escaping from Kavanaugh and friend Mark Judgeís clutches, rushing out to the street upon hearing the pair go back downstairs to a living room from the bedroom where they assaulted her.Ford has never offered an explanation of how she, then 15 years old, and who, by her own reckoning, could not drive, made it miles back to her home.Mitchell began her line of questioning about her return home by trying to approximate the location of the party, which has also never been definitively established in Fordís allegations. Using a map, Mitchell showed that if the party were within one mile of the country club from which Ford claimed she came before the party, it would be between 6.2 and 8.2 miles from her home.Ford confirmed that this would have been the driving distance.†ìWould it be fair to say that somebody drove you somewhere, either to the party or home from the party,î Mitchell asked, and Ford responded that it was.Next, Mitchell inquired if anyone could corroborate this aspect of Fordís story by saying he/she†was the driver. ìHas anyone come forward to say to you, ëHey, remember I was the one who drove you home?'î Mitchell asked.Ford admitted no one had.

One of her friends even claimed that her fear of flying was a result of the alleged assault by Judge Brett Kavanaugh over 35 years ago.Watch the exchange:†As Politico reported:The GOP has been told that Ford does not want to fly from her California home to Washington, according to the Republican senator, which means she may need to drive across the country. Ford has reportedly told friends she is uncomfortable in confined spaces, indicating a physical difficulty in making the trip by plane.Committee chair Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) then offered to travel to California to interview Ford, relieving her of the need to fly. She declined. There was talk of having Ford drive across the country to make the hearing.Yet under questioning by Mitchell, Ford admitted that she had, in fact, flown across the country to make the hearing. She had also flown to the east coast for a vacation with family in August. She also admitted flying frequently for her work and for her hobbies, including surfing vacations in Hawaii, Costa Rica, and French Polynesia. Ford, laughing nervously, said that it was easier to fly for vacations.Critics had speculated that the sole reason Democrats, and Ford, were refusing a Monday hearing ó or even a compromise Wednesday hearing ó was because a Thursday hearing would make it almost impossible for the Senate to hold a confirmation vote on Judge Kavanaugh before the Supreme Court begins its new session on October 1.Joel B.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/pollak-dianne-feinsteins-opening-statement-at-brett-kavanaugh-hearing-was-a-mockery-of-justice/,"Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) delivered an opening statement Thursday to the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Christine Blasey Fordís accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh that represented a complete inversion of the principles of justice upon which our republic is founded.Feinstein attempted to place Fordís allegations in the context of the broader ì#metooî movement, and lamented that accusers who came forward were, as she put it, ìre-victimized.îThe Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees the right of an accused ìto be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.îTo demand that accusers provide evidence, and that they submit to cross-examination by the accused, is not ìre-vicitmizingî them. It is fundamental to the basic principles of justice and the individual rights in our constitution. The alternative ó a society where a mere accusation is enough to invoke punishment ó would be horrific.Feinstein lamented what she called a ìrush to judgment.î But she did not mean a rush to judge Brett Kavanaugh. On the contrary, she repeated accusations against Kavanaugh as if they had been proved, without using the word ìalleged.î She also quoted accusations that had been made in the media against Kavanaugh by people who also refused to answer further questions, like Kavanaughís college roommate (now a Silicon Valley CEO), James Roche.Feinstein then complained about†ìthe unwillingness to take these kinds of allegations at face valueî ó making it clear that she†wants a rush to judgment ó in favor of the accuser and against the accused.Breitbart News Senior Legal Editor Ken Klukowski notes: ìUnder the Constitutionís Speech or Debate Clause, a Member of the House and Senate can never be sued or otherwise questioned about anything they say on the House or Senate floor or in a committee meeting.ìFeinstein could accuse Judge Kavanaugh of any crime, she can slander him or anyone else, she could even commit a felony by reading aloud from classified documents, and under this legislative immunity she could never be sued or charged with any of it.îStill, it is shocking that someone who abuses the rights of the accused is the senior member of the minority party on the committee that evaluates judges and conducts oversight of the judicial system in general.Joel B.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/chuck-grassley-slams-dianne-feinstein-shameful-way-to-treat-dr-ford-amid-media-circus/,"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) slammed ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinsteinís (D-CA) ìshameful wayî of pushing Christine Blasey Ford to testify amidst a ìmedia circus.îGrassley held a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday to discuss California psychology professor Christine Blasey Fordís accusation that Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh allegedly attempted to sexually assault her when they were both in high school in the 1980s.Chairman Grassley said that he lamented how this hearing arose, given that Sen. Feinstein did not relay this information during the committeeís confirmation process until the ìeleventh hour.îGrassley said that six separate Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) inquiries did not reveal anything to suggest that Kavanaugh engaged in any inappropriate sexual behavior.ìNowhere in any of these six FBI reports, which committee investigators have reviewed on a bipartisan basis, was there ever a whiff of any issue ñ at all ñ related in any way to inappropriate sexual behavior,î Grassley said.Sen. Grassley noted that Feinstein learned about these accusations two months ago, but waited until after the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation process finished to take action.ìDr. Ford first raised her allegations in a secret letter to the Ranking Member nearly two months ago in July. The Ranking Member took no action,î Grassley explained. ìThe letter wasnít shared with me, our colleagues, or my staff. These allegations couldíve been investigated in a way that maintained the confidentiality Dr. Ford requested.îThe Iowa senator then elaborated that Feinstein did not ask Kavanaugh about the accusations during her meeting with the nominee in August, during their four-day confirmation hearing in September, and not during a closed committee session on the last evening of the hearing, which, Grassley adds, Feinstein did not attend.ìThroughout this period, we did not know about the Ranking Memberís secret evidence,î the Iowa Republican added.Chairman Grassley then charged that Feinstein referred these allegations to the FBI only ìat the eleventh hour,î at which time the allegations were leaked to the press, all to Fordís dismay because she had insisted on confidentiality.ìThis is a shameful way to treat Dr. Ford, who insisted on confidentiality, and Judge Kavanaugh, who has had to address these allegations in the midst of a media circus,î Grassley said.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/cracks-and-contradictions-found-in-christine-blasey-ford-documents/,"Attorneys for Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford released her polygraph report and a statement Wednesday, both of which appear to have further unraveled her allegations.To begin with, Fordís polygraph test is highly unusual. After writing out her own statement of her allegations in longhand, she was asked only two questions by the test administrator: ì1) Is any part of your statement false? 2) Did you make up any part of your statement?îFord answered ìnoî to both questions and passed the test.Ford was not asked any specific questions about the specific allegation. There are also no test or baseline questions where the subject is intentionally asked to lie. This is raising all kinds of questions.Then there is Fordís written statement itself, which is riddled with cross-outs and corrections. We have no way of knowing if those corrections were made before or after the polygraph was taken.Most remarkable are the contradictions between Fordís statement written on August 7 for the polygraph, and the letter Ford sent to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) only a week earlier on July 30.On a matter as important as the number of people (witnesses) who were at the 1982 house party where the attempted assault allegedly took place, Ford told Feinstein that ìme and 4 othersî attended the gathering. That would be five people.One week later, though, Ford passed a polygraph, in which she wrote there were ì4 boys and a couple of girlsî ó or six people.Even if she includes herself as one of the ìcouple of girls,î the count is still off.Whatís more, in 2012, according to her own therapistís notes, Ford said there were four boys in the room during the alleged assault. Ford told the far-left Washington Post there were only two boys in the room (Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge) and that her therapist got it mixed up.What this means is that all of the written documentation contradicts the number of people in the room and the number of people at the party.Another contradiction comes from Fordís travel dates around the time of the polygraph and her reported fear of flying.One of the primary reasons everything has been delayed an extra week (a primary goal of Democrats) is to accommodate Fordís apparent fear of flying. Her attorney informed the Senate Judiciary Committee she could not appear earlier than this Thursday due to her fear of confined spaces.According to ABC News, ìFordís fear of flying is directly related to her allegation of assault, and that an airplane is the ultimate closed space where you cannot get away.îBut in her letter to Feinstein, Ford writes, ìI am available to speak further should you wish to discuss. I am currently vacationing in the mid-Atlantic until August 7th and will be in California after August 10th.îConfirming her whereabouts in the Mid-Atlantic is in her polygraph report, which was administered on August 7 in Maryland. But in her letter to Feinstein, Ford says she will be in California by the 10th.If you are in Maryland on the 7th of August and afraid to fly, the only way to be in California by the 10th of August would be to take a grueling 2,700-plus mile cross country trip that requires at least 42 hours on the road ó not counting delays and the necessary stops for gas, food, and bathroom breaks.Finally, Ford is now refusing to release the aforementioned notes from her therapist. This comes after Ford chose to use the Washington Post to introduce those very same notes into the court of public opinion as evidence for her claim.Here is how she used those notes to back up her claim on September 16:Ford said she told no one of the incident in any detail until 2012, when she was in couples therapy with her husband. The therapistís notes, portions of which were provided by Ford and reviewed by The Washington Post, do not mention Kavanaughís name but say she reported that she was attacked by students ìfrom an elitist boysí schoolî who went on to become ìhighly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.î The notes say four boys were involved, a discrepancy Ford says was an error on the therapistís part. Ford said there were four boys at the party but only two in the room.Ford did not mention Kavanaugh by name to her therapist, but she now wants to claim this session is proof she mentioned the incident prior to his Supreme Court nomination.Even more troubling is the fact she was willing to allow the anti-Trump Post to see her therapistís notes, but not the Senate Judicial Committee, and by extension, the American people.These latest contradictions and cracks in Fordís allegation, stretching back to when she was 15† and †Kavanaugh 17, comes on the heels of all four of her supposed witnesses basically siding with Kavanaugh.Ford named three males who were at this alleged house party and one other female.The three males (Kavanaugh, Judge, and PJ Smyth) have no memory of the alleged misconduct or even the house party.The female witness, Leland Ingham Keyser, who is a Democrat and a lifelong friend of Fordís, not only doesnít remember the house party in question, she says she has never met Kavanaugh.Every single witness named by Ford says they have no memory of any of this. The same is true of Kavanaughís second accuser, Deborah Garcia, who told her admittedly flimsy story to the New Yorker, but has so far refused to go under oath.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/09/27/hate-machine-cnn-pushes-brett-kavanaugh-allegation-hours-accuser-recants/,"CNN pushed a sexual misconduct allegation against Brett Kavanaugh Wednesday night, hours after the accuser had already recanted.On Wednesday, news broke about a Rhode Island man named Jeff Catalan who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of raping a ìclose associateî of his on a boat in 1985.Catalan made his accusation through the office of Rep. Sheldon Whitehouse (R-RI). According to transcripts of the phone call where Kavanaugh denied the allegation to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Catalan said his associate was ìsexually assaulted by two heavily inebriated men she referred to at the time as Brett and Mark,î a reference to Kavanaugh and his high school friend Mark Judge.Wednesday afternoon, however, just before 5:00 p.m. Eastern, Catalan admitted he had made a mistake and recanted the allegation:Do everyone who is going crazy about what I had said I have recanted because I have made a mistake and apologize for such mistakeó Jeffrey Catalan (@JeffreyCatala16) September 26, 2018Catalan is also a virulent anti-Trumper who has attacked Trump as a ìparasite that occupies the White House.îNevertheless, at 7:33 p.m. Eastern, the far-left CNN not only used the already-recanted and totally false Rhode Island accusation for a breathless breaking news report against Kavanaugh, as you can see for yourself, but†CNN did not even†bother to report that the allegation had already been recanted.Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), a member of the Judiciary Committee, commented on it in a tweet Wednesday night.ìOne of the unfortunate results of the media frenzy Senate Democrats have created by taking allegations straight to media instead of through the process,î he wrote, ì[is that] major outlets are still reporting on this accusation even though the accuser has recantedî:One of the unfortunate results of the media frenzy Senate Democrats have created by taking allegations straight to media instead of through the process ó major outlets are still reporting on this accusation even though the accuser has recanted.  https://t.co/nLQnEsaVVZó Senator Hatch Office (@senorrinhatch) September 27, 2018Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

This was the culture in which Ford/Kavanaugh existed. https://t.co/WnUGhsyuKyó Emily Jane Fox (@emilyjanefox) September 27, 2018Christine Blasey Fordís prepared opening statement:†Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the Committee: Eleven days ago, Dr. Ford publicly accused me of committing a serious wrong more than 36 years ago when we were both in high school. I denied the allegation immediately, unequivocally, and categorically. The next day, I told this Committee that I wanted to testify as soon as possible, under oath, to clear my name.Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired. There has been a frenzy to come up with somethingóanything, no matter how far-fetched or odiousóthat will block a vote on my nomination. These are last-minute smears, pure and simple. They debase our public discourse. And the consequences extend beyond any one nomination. Such grotesque and obvious character assassinationóif allowed to succeedówill dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country.As I told this Committee the last time I appeared before you, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. That is the kind of judge I am and will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. This effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. I am here this morning to answer these allegations and to tell the truth. And the truth is that I have never sexually assaulted anyoneónot in high school, not in college, not ever.Sexual assault is horrific. It is morally wrong. It is illegal. It is contrary to my religious faith. And it contradicts the core promise of this Nation that all people are created equal and entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Allegations of sexual assault must be taken seriously. Those who make allegations deserve to be heard. The subject of allegations also deserves to be heard. Due process is a foundation of the American rule of law.Dr. Fordís allegation dates back more than 36 years, to a party that she says occurred during our time in high school. I spent most of my time in high school focused on academics, sports, church, and service. But I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now. But thatís not why we are here today. What Iíve been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior. I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes.The allegation of misconduct is completely inconsistent with the rest of my life. The record of my life, from my days in grade school through the present day, shows that I have always promoted the equality and dignity of women.I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford. I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford. I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time. But I have never done that to her or to anyone. I am innocent of this charge.†

A hired woman to ask the questions.îPelosi later said that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellís (R-KY) ìterm of artî was ìfemale assistant,î which refers to Rachel Mitchell, the Arizona prosecutor Senate Republicans hired to ask some questions on Thursday morning.Pelosi also said that women who have come forward with allegations of sexual assault/misconduct against Kavanaugh have been ìviolatedî many different times throughout the process.Pelosi said that the first violation is the ìphysical violation that happenedî and the second ìis the invasion of privacy and assault on the person who comes forward.îìDr. Blasey Ford has had two two assaultsóone personal and an assault on her familyís privacy,î Pelosi said. ìThis has a chilling effect on people coming forwardÖ it took great courage for her to come forward.îPelosi then claimed that the ìthird assault is the assault by the cowardice of the Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee to act in the manner,î which she said ìdoes not serve justice, does not serve seeking the truth, does not serve the integrity of the court, and does not serve the respect for women in this country.
ìThree attacks,î she reiterated.Pelosi then briefly referred to Kavanaugh as ìJustice Kavanaughî before quickly correcting herself and calling on ìJudge Kavanaughî to ìwithdraw his name.îShe said she hoped that ìJustice Kavanaughójudge, not to be iusticeóJudge KavanauighÖ will withdraw his name.îPelosi added that ìbecause unless he goes before the committee and tells the truthÖ he not only jeopardizes his appointment to the Supreme Court, he jeopardizes by lying to Congress the position he holds now.îPelosi continued: ìDo the right thing for our country and for the Republicans, quite frankly: End this thing.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/27/full-text-christine-blasey-fords-prepared-senate-testimony/,"The following statement is Christine Blasey Fordís prepared written testimony, which the California psychology professor who brought forth an allegation†of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, will deliver in a Thursday Senate Judiciary Committee hearing:Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, Members of the Committee. My name is Christine Blasey Ford. I am a Professor of Psychology at Palo Alto University and a Research Psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine.I was an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina and earned my degree in Experimental Psychology in 1988. I received a Masterís degree in 1991 in Clinical Psychology from Pepperdine University. In 1996, I received a PhD in Educational Psychology from the University of Southern California. I earned a Masterís degree in Epidemiology from the Stanford University School of Medicine in 2009.I have been married to Russell Ford since 2002 and we have two children.I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school. I have described the events publicly before. I summarized them in my letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, and again in my letter to Chairman Grassley. I understand and appreciate the importance of your hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact it has had on my life and on my family.I grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. I attended the Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland, from 1980 to 1984. Holton-Arms is an all-girls school that opened in 1901. During my time at the school, girls at Holton-Arms frequently met and became friendly with boys from all-boys schools in the area, including Landon School, Georgetown Prep, Gonzaga High School, country clubs, and other places where kids and their families socialized. This is how I met Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me.In my freshman and sophomore school years, when I was 14 and 15 years old, my group of friends intersected with Brett and his friends for a short period of time. I had been friendly with a classmate of Brettís for a short time during my freshman year, and it was through that connection that I attended a number of parties that Brett also attended. We did not know each other well, but I knew him and he knew me. In the summer of 1982, like most summers, I spent almost every day at the Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase, Maryland swimming and practicing diving.One evening that summer, after a day of swimming at the club, I attended a small gathering at a house in the Chevy Chase/Bethesda area. There were four boys I remember being there: Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, P.J. Smyth, and one other boy whose name I cannot recall. I remember my friend Leland Ingham attending. I do not remember all of the details of how that gathering came together, but like many that summer, it was almost surely a spur of the moment gathering. I truly wish I could provide detailed answers to all of the questions that have been and will be asked about how I got to the party, where it took place, and so forth. I donít have all the answers, and I donít remember as much as I would like to. But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult.When I got to the small gathering, people were drinking beer in a small living room on the first floor of the house. I drank one beer that evening. Brett and Mark were visibly drunk. Early in the evening, I went up a narrow set of stairs leading from the living room to a second floor to use the bathroom. When I got to the top of the stairs, I was pushed from behind into a bedroom. I couldnít see who pushed me. Brett and Mark came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them. There was music already playing in the bedroom. It was turned up louder by either Brett or Mark once we were in the room. I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on top of me. He began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me. I yelled, hoping someone downstairs might hear me, and tried to get away from him, but his weight was heavy. Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because he was so drunk, and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes. I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me. Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack. They both seemed to be having a good time. Mark was urging Brett on, although at times he told Brett to stop. A couple of times I made eye contact with Mark and thought he might try to help me, but he did not.During this assault, Mark came over and jumped on the bed twice while Brett was on top of me. The last time he did this, we toppled over and Brett was no longer on top of me. I was able to get up and run out of the room. Directly across from the bedroom was a small bathroom. I ran inside the bathroom and locked the door. I heard Brett and Mark leave the bedroom laughing and loudly walk down the narrow stairs, pin-balling off the walls on the way down. I waited and when I did not hear them come back up the stairs, I left the bathroom, ran down the stairs, through the living room, and left the house. I remember being on the street and feeling an enormous sense of relief that I had escaped from the house and that Brett and Mark were not coming after me.Brettís assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details. I did not want to tell my parents that I, at age 15, was in a house without any parents present, drinking beer with boys. I tried to convince myself that because Brett did not rape me, I should be able to move on and just pretend that it had never happened. Over the years, I told very few friends that I had this traumatic experience. I told my husband before we were married that I had experienced a sexual assault. I had never told the details to anyone until May 2012, during a couples counseling session. The reason this came up in counseling is that my husband and I had completed an extensive remodel of our home, and I insisted on a second front door, an idea that he and others disagreed with and could not understand. In explaining why I wanted to have a second front door, I described the assault in detail. I recall saying that the boy who assaulted me could someday be on the U.S. Supreme Court and spoke a bit about his background. My husband recalls that I named my attacker as Brett Kavanaugh.After that May 2012 therapy session, I did my best to suppress memories of the assault because recounting the details caused me to relive the experience, and caused panic attacks and anxiety. Occasionally I would discuss the assault in individual therapy, but talking about it caused me to relive the trauma, so I tried not to think about it or discuss it. But over the years, I went through periods where I thought about Brettís attack. I confided in some close friends that I had an experience with sexual assault. Occasionally I stated that my assailant was a prominent lawyer or judge but I did not use his name. I do not recall each person I spoke to about Brettís assault, and some friends have reminded me of these conversations since the publication of The Washington Post story on September 16, 2018. But until July 2018, I had never named Mr. Kavanaugh as my attacker outside of therapy.This all changed in early July 2018. I saw press reports stating that Brett Kavanaugh was on the ìshort listî of potential Supreme Court nominees. I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaughís conduct so that those considering his potential nomination would know about the assault.
On July 6, 2018, I had a sense of urgency to relay the information to the Senate and the President as soon as possible before a nominee was selected. I called my congressional representative and let her receptionist know that someone on the Presidentís shortlist had attacked me. I also sent a message to The Washington Postís confidential tip line. I did not use my name, but I provided the names of Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. I stated that Mr. Kavanaugh had assaulted me in the 1980s in Maryland. This was an extremely hard thing for me to do, but I felt I couldnít NOT do it. Over the next two days, I told a couple of close friends on the beach in California that Mr.Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted me. I was conflicted about whether to speak out.On July 9, 2018, I received a call from the office of Congresswoman Anna Eshoo after Mr. Kavanaugh had become the nominee. I met with her staff on July 11 and with her on July 13, describing the assault and discussing my fear about coming forward. Later, we discussed the possibility of sending a letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, who is one of my stateís Senators, describing what occurred. My understanding is that Representative Eshooís office delivered a copy of my letter to Senator Feinsteinís office on July 30, 2018. The letter included my name, but requested that the letter be kept confidential.My hope was that providing the information confidentially would be sufficient to allow the Senate to consider Mr. Kavanaughís serious misconduct without having to make myself, my family, or anyoneís family vulnerable to the personal attacks and invasions of privacy we have faced since my name became public. In a letter on August 31, 2018, Senator Feinstein wrote that she would not share the letter without my consent. I greatly appreciated this commitment. All sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves whether their private experience is made public.As the hearing date got closer, I struggled with a terrible choice: Do I share the facts with the Senate and put myself and my family in the public spotlight? Or do I preserve our privacy and allow the Senate to make its decision on Mr. Kavanaughís nomination without knowing the full truth about his past behavior?I agonized daily with this decision throughout August and early September 2018. The sense of duty that motivated me to reach out confidentially to The Washington Post, Representative Eshooís office, and Senator Feinsteinís office was always there, but my fears of the consequences of speaking out started to increase.During August 2018, the press reported that Mr. Kavanaughís confirmation was virtually certain. His allies painted him as a champion of womenís rights and empowerment. I believed that if I came forward, my voice would be drowned out by a chorus of powerful supporters. By the time of the confirmation hearings, I had resigned myself to remaining quiet and letting the Committee and the Senate make their decision without knowing what Mr. Kavanaugh had done to me.Once the press started reporting on the existence of the letter I had sent to Senator Feinstein, I faced mounting pressure. Reporters appeared at my home and at my job demanding information about this letter, including in the presence of my graduate students. They called my boss and co- workers and left me many messages, making it clear that my name would inevitably be released to the media. I decided to speak out publicly to a journalist who had responded to the tip I had sent to The Washington Post and who had gained my trust. It was important to me to describe the details of the assault in my own words.Since September 16, the date of The Washington Post story, I have experienced an outpouring of support from people in every state of this country. Thousands of people who have had their lives dramatically altered by sexual violence have reached out to share their own experiences with me and have thanked me for coming forward. We have received tremendous support from friends and our community.At the same time, my greatest fears have been realized ó and the reality has been far worse than what I expected. My family and I have been the target of constant harassment and death threats. I have been called the most vile and hateful names imaginable. These messages, while far fewer than the expressions of support, have been terrifying to receive and have rocked me to my core. People have posted my personal information on the internet. This has resulted in additional emails, calls, and threats. My family and I were forced to move out of our home. Since September 16, my family and I have been living in various secure locales, with guards. This past Tuesday evening, my work email account was hacked and messages were sent out supposedly recanting my description of the sexual assault.Apart from the assault itself, these last couple of weeks have been the hardest of my life. I have had to relive my trauma in front of the entire world, and have seen my life picked apart by people on television, in the media, and in this body who have never met me or spoken with me. I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives. Those who say that do not know me. I am a fiercely independent person and I am no oneís pawn. My motivation in coming forward was to provide the facts about how Mr. Kavanaughís actions have damaged my life, so that you can take that into serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed. It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court. My responsibility is to tell the truth.I understand that the Majority has hired a professional prosecutor to ask me some questions, and I am committed to doing my very best to answer them. At the same time, because the Committee Members will be judging my credibility, I hope to be able to engage directly with each of you.
At this point, I will do my best to answer your questions.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/planned-parenthood-fundraises-off-kavanaugh-accuser-julie-swetnick/,"Planned Parenthood sent out an email fundraiser letter to supporters Wednesday announcing that a third woman, Julie Swetnick, is accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.ìEnough is enough: Kavanaugh must withdraw now,î writes Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, in an email made available to Breitbart News.She continues:Moving forward with Kavanaughís nomination at this point would be irresponsible and dangerous.†It tells survivors of sexual assault that they donít matter. It tells the public that one manís promotion matters more than the safety of multiple women. And it sends a message that partisan politics trumps not only fairness, but basic human compassion.Speak out now: This nomination is a disgrace. Brett Kavanaugh must withdraw.ì[T]ogether, funneling our hurt and our anger into action, weíll stop this nomination from going any further,î Laguens adds.The fundraising letter comes with a ìtrigger warningî as well: ìThis message includes information about sexual assault.†If you are finding it difficult to hear about sexual violence in the media and online, remember to take care of yourself.îQuestions, however, arose†quickly about Swetnickís accusations after it was discovered that she would have been a college student during the period of time she claims Kavanaugh was ìpresentî at gang rapes during high school parties.Breitbart News reported:On Wednesday morning, Michael Avenatti, the aspiring presidential candidate and lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, released a sworn affidavit from Swetnick in which she claimed to have met Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge in ìapproximately 1980-1981.îShe then went on to claim that in 1981-82, she ìbecame aware of effortsî by Kavanaugh, Judge, and others to ìspikeî the punch ìat house parties I attendedî with the intent of incapacitating a girl who could then be gang raped. She said she witnessed Kavanaugh and Judge lining up outside a room waiting for their ìturn.î She also said that in 1982, she was a victim of such gang rape, while drugged, with Kavanaugh and Judge ìpresent.îHowever, according to her resumÈ, Swetnick graduated from Gaithersburg High School in 1980 prior to attending the University of Maryland. Kavanaugh graduated from Georgetown Prep in 1983. These details indicate Swetnick would have known Kavanaugh while she was 17 or 18, and he was 15 or 16 years old and that she was attending high school parties while she was a college student.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/kavanaugh-twilight-zone-interview-transcript-unveiled/,"The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday released a lightly redacted copy of the transcript of Mondayís conference call between Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and committee staff.The call, conducted under threat of criminal penalty for lying, reveals an exasperated Kavanaugh countering accusation after accusation, likening his situation to an episode of The Twilight Zone.The transcript reveals previously unknown details and one heretofore unrevealed accusation involving Kavanaugh and a man, suggested to be Mark Judge, sexually assaulting a woman on a boat off the coast of Newport, Rhode Island, in 1985, only to be confronted the next morning by two men who then severely beat Kavanaugh and Judge.This new fifth accuser, according to the Senate Judiciary Committee staffer on the call, conveyed his allegations by telephone on Monday to Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI). The staffer then read Whitehouseís officeís report over the phone:Senator Whitehouse received a call this morning from a Rhode Island constituent, [REDACTED], who made allegations regarding U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. [REDACTED] reported that early on a Sunday morning in August of 1985, a close acquaintance of the constituent was sexually assaulted by two heavily inebriated men she referred to at the time as Brett and Mark.The event took place on a 36-foot maroon and white boat in the harbor at Newport, Rhode Island, after the three had met at a local bar. According to [REDACTED], when he learned of the assault at approximately 5:00 a.m. that same morning, he and another individual went to the harbor, located the boat the victim had described and physically confronted the two men, leaving them with significant injuries.[REDACTED] recently realized that one of the men was Brett Kavanaugh when he saw Kavanaughís high school yearbook photo on television over the weekend. He promptly reported the incident to our office on Monday morning, September 24, 2018.The newest accuserís name is left redacted in the transcript, but reporters quickly identified the Twitter account quoted in the same transcript as making repeated calls for the U.S. military to carry out a coup against President Donald Trump. The Twitter account belongs to a man named†Jeffrey Catalan. As Fox Newsís Alex Pfeiffer pointed out, the same account also suggested Donald Trump killed someone in 1983:https://twitter.com/PfeifferDC/status/1045096733926203392As reporters began to swarm the Catalan account, it appeared to withdraw his claims of having beaten Kavanaugh up for raping someone, saying, ìDo [sic] everyone who is going crazy about what I had said I have recanted because I have made a mistake and apologize for such mistakeî:Do everyone who is going crazy about what I had said I have recanted because I have made a mistake and apologize for such mistakeó Jeffrey Catalan (@JeffreyCatala16) September 26, 2018On Monday, days before this apparent retraction, Kavanaugh categorically denied Catalanís accusation, saying, ìI was not in Newport, havenít†been on a boat in Newport. Not with Mark Judge on a boat,†nor all those three things combined. This is just†completely made up, or at least not me. I donít know what†theyíre referring to.îAlso first unveiled in the transcript are new details of the fourth accusation, an anonymous letter alleging Kavanaugh ìshovedî the writerís daughterís friend ìup against the wall very aggressively and sexuallyî after leaving a bar together in 1998. The letter is revealed to have originated in Denver, Colorado. The unnamed daughter is supposedly from Boulder, Colorado. And Kavanaugh is said to have been ìdatingî the women he shoved.ì[W]eíre dealing with an†anonymous letter about an anonymous person and an anonymous friend. Itís ridiculous. Total twilight zone. And no,†Iíve never done anything like that,î Kavanaugh responded.When a staffer asked Kavanaugh about dating the unnamed woman in the letter, Kavanaugh pointed out that the accusation provides nothing that could identify the woman in question in the following exchange:Staffer: While you were involved in the Starr†investigation, do you recall ever dating a woman who would†fairly fit the description in the letter provided to†Senator [Cory] Gardner [(R-CO)]? The anonymous letter.Judge Kavanaugh: Whatís the description?Staffer: Just based on what I óJudge Kavanaugh: Describe her appearance.Staffer: No, itís ó all we have is what I read.Judge Kavanaugh: Well, then I donít know what Iím†responding to then.In his most in-depth answers so far revealed about his second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, Kavanaugh again denied having exposed himself to her in a drunken dormitory common room party his freshman year of college. He acknowledges the two knew each other in college, describing their relationship as ìfriendly, but not friends.î Kavanaughís confirmed the two had seen each since college, most recently at a mutual classmateís wedding, where, as Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayerís New Yorker story noted, she did not mention the alleged incident and posed ìsmilingî in photographs with Kavanaugh.ìIím sure I saw her†because it wasnít a huge wedding. And at any wedding, you†would see the people that you went to school with. But I†donít have a specific recollection,î Kavanaugh said.James Roche, Kavanaughís freshman roommate ó who told reporters that Kavanaugh was an excessive drinker and that he believed Ramirez, who was a close college friend, despite having no recollection of such an incident ó also came up in the questioning. Kavanaugh claimed Roche, who then went by Jamie, ìhatedî their third roommate,†Dave White:Jamie and Dave White hated each other. They†got in fights, fist fights during the year. One time Dave White was away for the weekend. Jamie ó when he came†back, Jamie had moved all Dave Whiteís furniture,†everything, like into some other area of Lawrence Hall in a†hallway.He continued:I was friends with Dave White more than†Jamie. I tried to be civil. Jamie wasnít around a lot. I†donít know, I think his parents lived nearby, and so he was†elsewhere or with a girl, I donít know, a woman at Yale. [REDACTED]†He didnít hang out with us very†much, wasnít a great situation.The transcript also includes extensive questioning about Kavanaughís high school yearbook that anti-trump activist and attorney Michael Avenatti has claimed contains secret codes about sexually assaulting girls. In one exchange, Kavanaugh explained that ìdevilís triangleî referred to a drinking game heíd played in high school, not, as Avenatti claimed, a lewd sex act. Asked why he included the reference, Kavanaugh responded, ìI donít know. We were 17.îKavanaughís first use of the phrase ìtwilight zone,î which he also used in response to Avenattiís client Julie Swetnickís claims, occurs when discussing how ìoutragedî he is by the New Yorker/Deborah Ramirez story:The New York Times says as recently as last week, she† was calling around to other classmates saying she wasnít†sure I had done this. And you know, I think ó I think weíre ó this is an outrage for this kind of thin,†uncorroborated, 35-year-old accusation to be leveled in†this fashion at this time. Iíve been in the public eye for†24 years, since I started with the independent counsel in†the fall of 1994, very public at various points in my life.†Iíve been through six background checks. I worked in†the White House at the highest levels, senior staff,†traveling with the President all over the world, seeing the most highly sensitive secrets of our Nation for years.†I†went through a difficult confirmation process for the D.C.†Circuit that was public with two separate confirmation†hearings in 2004 and 2006.Iíve been a judge for 12 years in a very public way.†Iíve been identified repeatedly as a potential Supreme†Court nominee. Whether that was accurate or not, Iíve been†publicly identified. My decisions have been publicly†discussed.†Iíve been very much a presence at the Yale College†reunions. Iíve been on multiple panels there. So Iíve†been active in the class. The class newsletter has talked†about me. The people in my class have been at those†reunions and those events.In all that time, not a word.†And then 4 days, you†know, when just right before a vote for the Supreme Court,†after the nomination itself has been pending for months, †and Iíve been through the hearings and 65 Senate meetings†and all the written questions, and then ó and then, after†all these years, with all this time, and all these†descriptions with no corroboration and with her best friend†saying she never heard about it, you know, Iím ó Iím†really just, you know, stunned. And outraged.Itís the twilight zone. I guess weíre going to get to†a few more of these twilight zone thingsÖKavanaugh will testify in an open hearing Thursday morning to answer allegations from his first accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.

And Iíve already read Dr. Blasey Fordís testimony and I believe her.îAfter Gillibrand stated the FBI should do a complete background check on Kavanaugh in light of the accusations against him, anchor Chris Cuomo asked,†ì[A]re you open to changing your mind?îGillibrand answered,†ìBased on everything I have heard to date, no. And before these allegations came to light, I thought Judge Kavanaughís record was disqualifying. His view on womenís rights, the fact that he doesnít see womenís reproductive freedom anywhere in the Constitution, the fact that he believes insurers have more free speech rights than you and I, if you have a preexisting condition, they should be able to charge you whatever they want, the fact that he believes my boss should decide whether I have access to contraception, all of those things, to me, are disqualifying. Because his views are so far outside the mainstream, so conservative, that I canít imagine him being a force for good on the court, and I canít imagine him actually having the kind of judicial character that is necessary to be a justice on the Supreme Court. Then you just add to that all these allegations. So, no, whatever he says tomorrow, it will not change my view.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/anonymous-letter-kavanaugh-shoved-someones-daughters-friend-in-1998/,"The Senate Judiciary Committee is reportedly investigating another accusation against Judge Brett Kavanaugh Wednesday after a woman in Colorado sent Sen. Cory Gardner (R-CO) an anonymous letter claiming her daughter told her Kavanaugh had shoved her friend against a wall while drinking in Washington, DC, in 1998.NBC News cites the letter and Judiciary Committee staff in reporting that the anonymous letter-writer claimed her daughter was out drinking with Kavanaugh and ìseveral friendsî 20 years ago in Washington. After the group left the bar, the letter claims, ìthey were all shocked when Brett Kavanaugh shoved her friend up against the wall very aggressively and sexually.îNone of the alleged participants are named, but the letter claims, ìThere were at least four witnesses including my daughter.îThe unnamed victim is purported to be too traumatized, 20 years after having been pushed against a wall, to talk about the incident. It is unclear from NBCís report how the letter writer came to the conclusion the victim is traumatized.According to NBC News, ìA Democratic source said the minority wasnít satisfied by the Republicansí questions about the incident during the call, calling them cursory, and believed it should be investigated more deeply.îAs with the other decades old allegations against Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee reportedly promptly denied the letterís claims, under threat of criminal penalty, in a call with committee staff.It is unclear if this latest accusation will feature in Thursdayís Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with the accuser who initially derailed Kavanaughís confirmation schedule, California professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of having groped her at a high school party in the early 1980s.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/dershowitz-third-brett-kavanaugh-accuser-does-not-ring-true/,"Harvard Law School emeritus professor and celebrated defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz told Breitbart News on Wednesday evening that the affidavit by Julie Swetnick, the third woman to accuse Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in high school, ìdoes not ring true.îSwetnick presented a sworn affidavit on Wednesday through her lawyer, Michael Avenatti ó who is also representing porn star Stormy Daniels in her litigation against President Donald Trump, and is exploring a presidential run in 2020 himself.ìAny reasonably competent [defense] attorney could demolish her affidavit,î Dershowitz said, noting that Swetnick had not explained what she meant when she alleged that Kavanaugh was ìpresentî at her gang rape.He also said that she had failed to explain why, if she had witnessed multiple gang rapes at parties among Kavanaughís friends in Maryland, she had kept going back to the parties.The affidavit looked as if it had been prepared in haste, Dershowitz said, as Avenatti likely realized he needed to publish it before Thursdayís hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee if it were to have any impact on the confirmation process.(Kavanaugh is scheduled to testify, along with the first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, whose claims have not been corroborated by any of the eyewitnesses she named.)Swetnick had mentioned two eyewitnesses, Dershowitz noted, but had not named them. ìAny lawyer should have been embarrassed to submit an affidavit like that.îHe criticized the Republican majority on the judiciary committee, however, for selecting Arizona prosecutor†Rachel Mitchell to lead questioning on Thursday. They should have named a defense attorney instead, he argued.ìWhat does a prosecutor know about cross-examintion? A prosecutor puts on a case.îJoel B.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/mark-walters-guns/,"As America watches the Democratic Partyís machine attempt to destroy Judge Brett Kavanaughís reputation, the†tactics employed by the left are on full display.Those tactics have included withholding information from the Committee Chair and the American people, subverting the hearing process with frequent outbursts from themselves and outside protest groups, smearing the nominee with falsified quotes, and other disruptions of the committee hearing process. All of this is designed to defy the President whom American voters chose in 2016; a President many chose for the express purpose of keeping the Supreme Court from being infiltrated by the leftists we are now watching smear a good man and his family.So I ask you, what does this confirmation process have to do with guns and the future of our right to bear arms besides the obvious expected pro-gun votes from the nominee himself should he be confirmed? Ask yourself that question the next time you hear a Democrat politician or leftist gun-prohibitionist say that they do not want to destroy the Second Amendment nor do they want to take away our guns. To believe that, you would also have to believe the party of gun-control currently destroying the reputation of Judge Kavanaugh would not be willing use the same underhanded techniques against those of us in the gun-owning community.For example, we would have to assume they were not capable of making up phony names such as ìassault rifles,î and lying about their use or of demonizing millions of law-abiding Americans by attacking the National Rifle Association as murderers. We would be have to be willing to accept that they would not possibly use false statistics and lump suicide numbers in with actual homicidesñin an efforts to pump up crime statisticsñor exaggerate the number of ìmass shootingsî in an attempt to ban our rights and the guns we choose for self-defense. We might even have to believe this group of Democrats would not dare tell us their goal is ìgun safetyî rather than gun control.But the problem is that Democrats and their leftist supporters are already calling our commonly owned firearms ìassault rifles,î exaggerating the number of mass shootings, and pawning off their entire gun control agenda as a push for gun safety. Because of this, the confirmation process Kavanaugh has faced stands as stark reminder of what law-abiding gun owners can expect should the Democrats regain control of the House and Senate in November.Mark Walters is the host of Armed American Radio and a guest columnist for ìDown Range with AWR Hawkins.î

But I guess the question that Beth Wilkinson, Kavanaughís attorney, is asking, why donít you and your client go to the police, presumably Montgomery County police or D.C. police?AVENATTI: Well, we are certainly considering that, Jake, as of this moment. But look, this is a distraction by counsel for Mr. Kavanaugh. Let me ask you this question. Weíve offered to have my client take a polygraph examination. Why wonít Brett Kavanaugh take a polygraph examination? Why wonít Brett Kavanaugh allow his close friend, Mark Judge, who is very knowledgeable about what happened, very knowledgeable about these allegations. Why are they hiding Mark Judge from the American people and the Senate Judiciary Committee? Why wonít they bring him in to testify truthfully? We wantólook, Jake, I want to be really clear about something. We want all of this aired and we want it aired publicly. And we want the American people to be able to decide who is lying and who is telling the truth. This should not be decided by a bunch of white privileged guys that are basically shaming sexual abuse victims.TAPPER: So youíre willingóyour client would be willing to testify publicly about her charges before the Senate committee?AVENATTI: Yes, absolutely. But we believe first, the first step should be a full FBI investigation. Jake, let me ask you this question. Why is it that when the most heinous crimes appear or occur, I should say, on U.S. soil, whether it be 9/11 or Timothy McVeigh or the Unabomber, the FBI investigates in those instances. Why are the Senate Judiciary Committee and Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump afraid to afraid to have the FBI investigate these allegations?TAPPER: Iím taking no position on it, but you havenít taken these allegations to local law enforcement, which seems like a reasonable thing to do, as far as I know. Iím under the impression there is no statute of limitation for rape in Montgomery County, Maryland. So that is something you could do. You say youíre considering it. I want to ask you about your clientís sworn declaration. She details a horrific assault, saying, quote, in approximately 1982, I became the victim of one of these gang or train rapes where Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh were present. Now she didnít specifically say that Kavanaugh was one of the attackers. Is your client claiming that Kavanaugh raped her?AVENATTI: Iím not going to have any further comment on that specific allegation. Sheís going to detail that for the FBI and hopefully for the Senate Judiciary Committee, ultimately, in a public hearing. But Iím not going to provide any óTAPPER: Thatís a pretty big thing to hang out there. Are you saying Kavanaugh was present? That Kavanaugh was present in the room? He was in the line? He was in the party? I mean, just to say he was present is a really egregious lack of specificity when youíre talking about charges this horrific. And Iím not saying that I donít believe them. Iím just saying, what exactly are you saying, or is she saying, that he did?AVENATTI: Jake, I disagree completely with what you just said. Let me be clear about something. This is not my declaration. These are statements by my client. These are her statements about what happened, and letís just eliminate that paragraph from the declaration, in its entirety, just for the sake of argument. Do you mean to tell me that the balance of the declaration still permits him to be sworn in as a sitting Supreme Court justice? No, it does not. The conduct that is littered throughout this declaration is outrageous. There are plenty of men and women in the United States that serve as attorneys and judges that donít have this kind of conduct in their background.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Your client says he doesnít know Mrs. Swetnick. He calls the allegations ridiculous and from the twilight zone. Is your client 100% confident heís never met her?WILKINSON: He doesnít know her. Heís never met her. We had people calling our office saying they donít know her. Theyíve never seen her at the parties that they attended with him. When you think about the allegations, they are alleging that for years there were gang rapes going on with multiple men, multiple women being victims. Thatís such a frightening allegation. I donít understand how her lawyer didnít go immediately to the police, and back then why people wouldnít have said something. We understand why women donít generally report sexual assault and they often donít talk about it for a long time, but this a quantum leap different. This is a frightening allegation that there were groups of boys with groups of girls over two years involved in drinking, drugs and gang rape. And no one ever went to the police, no one has gone to the police to this day to report those allegations? Itís truly outrageous.TUR: Are you calling her a liar?WILKINSON: Iím not calling her a liar. I think she has known about this for a while, supposedly, and so has Mr. Avenatti. He waved this on some of your programs since last weekend and said he knew about it and he never went to the police. As an attorney, I know what my obligation is. Itís to my client. And if I had represented her, it would have been my duty to go to the police immediately and report this. If this is true, it is a horrible thing. Thereís nothing that could have stopped Mr. Avenatti from going to the FBI or the police to start an investigation on his own. As far as I can tell from reading this, that wasnít done.TUR: All the women who have accused your client of misconduct have one similar thing in common. They all say he drank to excess. There are other folks out there from his high school years and from his college years who say the same thing, he drank to excess. Your client also admits he did at some times have a few too many beers. If thatís the case and if thereís a potential out there for him being black out drunk or very drunk, how is he confident of his memories?WILKINSON: First of all, almost every high school and college student could be accused of the same thing or have done, had drinks, had too many drinks. Thatís not the same as being black out drunk and not remembering this. He knows that he didnít know this woman. Sheís not saying itís once. Sheís saying itís over two years. This wasnít a one time thing. Thatís the same with the other two women. All the people who are supposedly there in those instances have said it didnít happen or they donít have any recollection. Thereís not one person who is saying they were there. In each of the incidents thereís groups of people that were identified as present. Thatís not typical in these allegations. Normally itís one man and one woman and itís hard to determine. Here, especially in the most recent outrageous allegation, thereís scores of people involved for years.TUR: Why is your client not demanding an FBI investigation to get to the bottom of this?WILKINSON: He didnít know about this until it came out today. Mr. Avenatti has had this information for weeks.TUR: Is he now demanding an FBI investigation?WILKINSON: He knows he didnít do it.TUR: Why doesnít he want an FBI investigation? If thereís multiple people who can go on the record or go under oath or be interviewed by the FB, why would he not want the FBI to get involved?WILKINSON: Thankfully our system doesnít work the way youíre suggesting.TUR: This is a job interview. Itís two different things.WILKINSON: Itís out here in the public opinion and what youíre doing is a perfect example. Youíre claiming because he was drinking, he must have done it.TUR: I asked you about his memory. Donít put words in my mouth. I asked if he was confident of his memories. Thatís all I asked.WILKINSON: I heard your last session and you were saying thereís so much detail. Thereís no detail in here. Thereís no place. Thereís one or two years generally. Thereís no other people. Thereís no dates. Thereís no times. Thereís no information. There are multiple people supposedly involved within several years, not just her. She saw other women being gang raped and itís never been reported. I donít know what the lawyer did and I feel sorry for her for getting dragged into this and any other woman getting dragged into it but that doesnít mean the accusations are true. This is a horrible commentary on our process this is what weíre putting people through who wants to be in public service. Itís important to treat everybody in the process with dignity and giving them the presumption of innocence whether youíre inside a courtroom or outside.TUR: Let me read you something the president said about this this morning. ëYou donít find people like this. Heís outstanding. Heís a gem and heís being treated unfairly by the Democrats who are playing a con game. They laugh at what they are getting away with.í Does your client believe itís a con game by the Democrats? That these women are part of a con by the Democrats and that the Democrats are laughing in a back room about what they are able to pull off?WILKINSON: †My client knows that he didnít do this. Heís not speculating about all those things. What he knows is all of his friends and family all say this isnít like him. Nobody corroborates one of these allegations that they saw this happen or were in the room. Even the lady who knows Dr. Blasey and was friendly with her and was in the same party says sheís never met Judge Kavanaugh. Heís not speculating about the politics. What heís telling you is what he knows. He did not do this.TUR: Does your client believe any of the accusers against the president?WILKINSON: Does he what?TUR: Does he believe any of the women who came out and accused the president of sexual misconduct?WILKINSON: I donít know what that has to do with this. Iíve never discussed that with him. Weíre talking about whatís happening here. I came today to be on your program to tell you what he believes and what we know. Thatís it. Iím not here to make political arguments and comment on what the president said or didnít say. The point is someone is making these outrageous allegations about him with no detail over multiple years with multiple people and heís telling you he did none of it. He doesnít know her. Iíve had people call me and email me saying they know him. Theyíve never met her. Theyíve never seen her and never heard of any of these allegations. Iíve got to believe if this was happening over two years someone else would have heard about it and reported it. Not the day before the hearing. Heís had an entire hearing, a background investigation, none of these people, including†Mr. Avenattiís client, came forward until the day before the hearing.TUR: Does he believe Dr. Ford is lying?WILKINSON: He doesnít believe anyone is lying or not lying. All he can say is what he knows. He did not do this. Heís never engaged in that behavior. He was a normal kid. He played sports. He was a good student. He drank beers and sometimes he said things he regrets and cringes at, like all of us. But that is very different than saying did you engage in a sexual assault. Absolutely not. He did not do that.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/obama-era-campus-sexual-misconduct-rules-national-stage-kavanaugh/,"The plight of Brett Kavanaugh ñ presumed guilty of sexual misconduct based solely on a womanís accusation and without due process ñ has been experienced by many young men on college campuses since the Obama administration utilized Title IX to enact its campus sexual assault policies.ìWhat has been happening to young men on college campuses is now playing out on the national stage with Judge Kavanaugh,î retired university administrator Patricia Daugherty told Breitbart News. ìIncredible money and ëtrainingí have gone into efforts to immediately side with the accuser, with little to no interest in due process for the accused. The fever pitch we see on the news has been nurtured in college.îThe Trump administrationís anticipated new rules reversing the Obama-era policies are, in fact, causing a feminist meltdown.At The Mary Sue, Chelsea Steiner†warned†that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos ìwants to protect everyone involved in sexual misconduct EXCEPT the victims.îìThe education secretary, who has endorsed a policy of using mediation to reach informal resolutions in cases of campus assault, wants to allow victims and their accused perpetrators to request any evidence they want from each other,î Steiner said, explaining her alarm. ìIn addition, victims and perpetrators would be able to cross-examine each other during the mediation.îDaugherty, who currently is president of Eagle Forum of Georgia, said parentsí concerns for their sons on college campuses are ìcompletely rational in this climate.îìWe are doing a terrible disservice to young men and also to young women by encouraging such emotional, fear-based atmospheres,î she added.In September 2017, DeVos announced the Trump administration would be scrapping the Obama administrationís policies regarding cases of sexual misconduct on college campuses. DeVos†stressed†in a new ìinterim Q & Aî that all students must be protected from discrimination in school proceedings to investigate sexual assault allegations.In her announcement, DeVos cited cases of students, nearly all male, who were either expelled or punished in some other manner after being accused of actions which were never proven.ìInstead of working with schools,î DeVos said, ìthe prior administration weaponized the Office for Civil Rights.îThe Trump administrationís proposed new rules were†leaked†to the†New York Times†at the end of August. While Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said the information leaked to the†Times†ìis premature and speculative,î the newspaper reported the rules ìnarrow the definition of sexual harassment, holding schools accountable only for formal complaints filed through proper authorities and for conduct said to have occurred on their campuses.îMany college and university officials have said they will ignore the new campus rules put forward by the Trump administration.Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro ñ now known for releasing a grand jury report alleging†at least 1,000 children were sexually abused by Roman Catholic clergy in his state over 70 years ñ condemned the Trump administrationís decision to scrap the Obama-era sexual misconduct policies.Shapiro said reversing the Obama administrationís policies ìthreaten to make college campuses less safe, not more safe.îìWe made important strides over the last years of the Obama administration when it comes to Title IX issues,î Shapiro said, according to TribLive. ìAnd the idea that Secretary Betsy DeVos would want to roll back those Title IX (civil rights) protections is something that does not sit well with me.îìI have all the confidence in the world in our university leaders of Pennsylvania,î Shapiro added. ìTheyíll fill the gap created by the Trump administrationís wrong-headed policies.îJoy Pullmann, executive editor at†the Federalist, told Breitbart News the ideology behind the implementation of the Obama-era policies on campuses sparked the fire that has spread across the nation.ìIt has always been true but is now becoming obvious to more Americans that what happens on campuses does not stay on campuses, or only affect the minority of Americans with college degrees,î she explained. ìU.S. colleges and universities create the ideas, atmosphere, and policies that affect the nation, plus the nationís taxpayers underwrite the bulk of our eliteís credentials through these institutions, and this is why everyone should care and raise his or her voice about what happens there.îìObamaís Title IX rules that amped up campus kangaroo courts were quite clearly a test run of the kind of sexist mob attacks they want to bring to the entire culture,î Pullmann added. ìThe effects are to degrade society by degrading justice itself, by reducing it to identity politics rather than the truth of what happened.îDaugherty said while she is encouraged by the Trump administrationís plans to reverse the Obama Title IX policy, she anticipates a continued battle.ìThat in itself wonít change the emphasis on todayís college campuses,î she warned. ìWay too many faculty and administrators are devoted to far-left political ideologies, and they are teaching these ideologies to their students every day.îParents of sons may continue to have reason to be concerned that liberal university pushback against the Trump administrationís new rules will still place young men, in particular, in danger of false accusations with minimal recourse.ìParents need to teach their sons to treat everyone with respect and dignity, but their sons canít be naÔve,î Daugherty said. ìI donít want them to be suspicious of all women, of course, but they need to be aware of not getting into situations that might come back to haunt them.îWriting at the Federalist, Melissa Danford, an army wife and mother of four boys, said what she is seeing now should stir parents of sons to rise up.ìI cannot accept a world in which my sons will be raised under the tyranny of a lawless, vindictive society that wants to subdue and oppress men in the name of equality for women,î she said. ìThe future isnít female; it belongs to both your daughters†and†my sons. Abandoning the basic standards of the rule of law will not empower women; it will enslave us all.îPullmann agreed it is ìquite rational for mothers to wonder whether their sons will be discriminated against simply because of their sex.îìGiven that we have not only seen high-profile assault hoaxes ñ such as Columbiaís ëmattress girlí and the UVA Rolling Stone hoax ñ but also a litany of lower-profile incidents on campuses throughout the country, some of which are being litigated in real courts due to the egregiously unjust outcomes,î she added.The†Daily Newsís editorial board also†said†due process is exactly what is needed to put an end to the ìkangaroo courtsî that have erupted on college campuses:Today, the accused have no way to see the evidence against them, no way to appeal. Tomorrow, they are likely to be able to cross-examine accusers, and vice versa.ÖThe hands wringing that fair procedures will terrify young women out of reporting serious violations ought to be applauding efforts to make Title IX a credible tool to vindicate victims.Pullmann added traditional sexual morality actually protects both men and women from sexual misconduct allegations and misconduct towards each other.ìBoth men and women should not have sex, or sexually charged interactions, with strangers while drunk,î she asserted. ìEven without alcohol, sex without a marital commitment puts both the man and the woman in danger, not only of accusations but of being mistreated sexually by someone who doesnít love them enough to commit to them for life.îPullmann advised parents to explicitly teach their sons ìnot to trivialize sex, but to regard it, and therefore women, as precious.îìSince neither our culture nor most educational institutions will do this ó sometimes not even churches ó parents must take the task upon themselves all the more if they want to protect both their sons and their daughters from the brutalities of our hookup culture,î she said.

Patty Murray (D-WA) said she was frightened by Republicans calling the allegations against†Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh a smear campaign.When asked about attorney Michael Avenattiís client†Julie Swetnickís new allegations, Murray said, ìI just read it, and it is horrifying. It is important to note that it is an affidavit and she has signed it under perjury or law. So people donít do this randomly. It needs to be investigated, absolutely. But let me step back for a minute and are remind†everybody that what we do as a Senate today and how we react to the allegations, and what message we send by how we deal with them is critically important. If the Senate were to swish this aside and dismiss Mrs. Ford and do what the president said, and start to call the allegations of she was drunk, we will send a message to young girls once again as we did in 1991 to be quiet, sit down and donít talk. And what is that message to young boys? Donít worry. You will get away with it. This is serious, and it needs to be taken absolutely with every, you know, things that we can do to make sure that the voices are brought forward and absolutely investigated. This is something that should not be rushed through. It is deeply disturbing me that these Republicans are doing because we canít send the message again. We just cannot.îAddressing the Republicans calling all the allegations a smear, Murray said, ìThe message that this is a smear campaign frightens me as a woman that once again, we are†saying to women out there, donít come forward, because you will be accused of smear campaigns., no one is going to believe you. Stop and do the investigations, and obviously, witnesses that can be called from both sides and so that we know that evidence and believe it or not, but have an investigation. To have it rushed through right now is such the wrong thing to do.îShe added, ìI believe that there are responsible Republicans who are going to share the view that it is not just a Supreme Court nominee that is on trial right now. It is the United States Senate in the year of the #MeToo movement. We have the obligation to show this country we a take the allegations seriously, and investigate them absolutely, but that they will be listened to and heard. We are on trial here as well. I plead with the Senate Republicans to take to a breath. Having somebody on the court on October 1st is less important than getting this right.îFollow Pam Key On Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/questions-about-julie-swetnick-claims-she-was-in-college-when-brett-kavanaugh-was-in-high-school/,"Questions arose Wednesday about claims by Julie Swetnick, the third ìaccuserî against Brett Kavanaugh, after it was revealed that she would have been in college during the time period she claims he was ìpresentî at gang rapes at high school parties.On Wednesday morning, Michael Avenatti, the aspiring presidential candidate and lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels, released a sworn affidavit from Swetnick in which she claimed to have met Kavanaugh and his friend Mark Judge in ìapproximately 1980-1981.îShe then went on to claim that in 1981-82, she ìbecame aware of effortsî by Kavanaugh, Judge, and others to ìspikeî the punch ìat house parties I attendedî with the intent of incapacitating a girl who could then be gang raped. She said she witnessed Kavanaugh and Judge lining up outside a room waiting for their ìturn.î She also said that in 1982, she was a victim of such gang rape, while drugged, with Kavanaugh and Judge ìpresent.îHowever, according to the New York Times, ìMs. Swetnick grew up in Montgomery County, Md., graduating from Gaithersburg High School in 1980 before attending college at the University of Maryland, according to a rÈsumÈ for her posted online. Judge Kavanaugh graduated from Georgetown Prep in 1983.îThat means she would have met Kavanaugh while she was 17 or 18, and he was 15 or 16 years old. It also would mean that she was attending high school parties while in college.So to summarize claims:Swetnick graduated High School in 1980.
In 1982, as a college student, she was attending high-school parties where druggings & gang rapes occurred with regularity.
She went back to those parties 10 times.
She is just now reporting this, 37 years later.
Okó Benny (@bennyjohnson) September 26, 2018One bit that investigators will focus on (if they ever agree to interview Swetnick) is why she was attending high school parties when she was already in college. https://t.co/keM0MZECIR pic.twitter.com/ZlCWsk7ZQió Yashar Ali  (@yashar) September 26, 2018To review the Avenatti claim: a woman claims that when she was a college aged adult (graduated high school in 1980), she went to high school parties where high school girls were drugged and raped and she, as the adult present, did nothing but avoid the punch.ó Erick Erickson (@EWErickson) September 26, 2018Senate Judiciary Committee staff investigating Swetnickís claims have reportedly failed to find corroborating witnesses or evidence, as of Wednesday afternoon.Joel B.

They refer to the other accusations as ìconsistent,î though Ramirezís claims were also denied by all of the eyewitnesses.It was not clear from the letter whether Democrats would still participate in Thursdayís scheduled hearing, where Ford and Kavanaugh are expected to testify under oath, and the judge ó who has served for twelve years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ó is expected to deny Fordís accusations and others that have emerged.On Wednesday, Swetnickís claims were presented by lawyer and presidential hopeful Michael Avenatti, who also represents porn star Stormy Daniels is a defamation suit against Trump that a federal judge seems poised to dismiss.The signatories to Wednesdayís letter include Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who falsely claimed to have served in Vietnam, and by Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), who admitted during college that he had groped a girl in high school without her consent.All of the claims emerged after confirmation hearings, and after ranking member Sen.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/full-text-brett-kavanaughs-prepared-senate-testimony-i-am-innocent-of-this-charge/,"The following statement is Brett Kavanaughís prepared written testimony, which the Supreme Court nominee will deliver in a Thursday Senate Judiciary Committee hearing:Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the Committee:Eleven days ago, Dr. Ford publicly accused me of committing a serious wrong more than 36 years ago when we were both in high school. I denied the allegation immediately, unequivocally, and categorically. The next day, I told this Committee that I wanted to testify as soon as possible, under oath, to clear my name.Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired. There has been a frenzy to come up with somethingóanything, no matter how far-fetched or odiousóthat will block a vote on my nomination. These are last-minute smears, pure and simple. They debase our public discourse. And the consequences extend beyond any one nomination. Such grotesque and obvious character assassinationóif allowed to succeedówill dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country.As I told this Committee the last time I appeared before you, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. That is the kind of judge I am and will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. This effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. I am here this morning to answer these allegations and to tell the truth. And the truth is that I have never sexually assaulted anyoneónot in high school, not in college, not ever.Sexual assault is horrific. It is morally wrong. It is illegal. It is contrary to my religious faith. And it contradicts the core promise of this Nation that all people are created equal and entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Allegations of sexual assault must be taken seriously. Those who make allegations deserve to be heard. The subject of allegations also deserves to be heard. Due process is a foundation of the American rule of law.Dr. Fordís allegation dates back more than 36 years, to a party that she says occurred during our time in high school. I spent most of my time in high school focused on academics, sports, church, and service. But I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now. But thatís not why we are here today. What Iíve† been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior. I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes.The allegation of misconduct is completely inconsistent with the rest of my life. The record of my life, from my days in grade school through the present day, shows that I have always promoted the equality and dignity of women.I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford. I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford. I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time. But I have never done that to her or to anyone. I am innocent of this charge.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/26/avenatti-my-client-is-willing-to-testify-on-kavanaugh-gang-rape-allegations/,"Wednesday on ABCís ìThe View,î attorney Michael Avenatti called in to discuss his client†Julie Swetnickís allegations against†Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh.Avenatti said, ìMoments ago, we sent a sworn declaration under penalty of perjury signed by my client, Julie Swetnick, detailing her allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge and others relating to the early í80s and what she observed and witnessed, as well as what transpired to her during that time period. We have asked the committee, as we did days ago, to launch a formal FBI investigation. My client is ready to meet with FBI agents to disclose what she knows in detail. We have also offered that sheíll take a polygraph exam if Brett Kavanaugh will take a polygraph exam. And let me also say that Iím looking forward to anyone attempting to challenge the credibility of my client, because she is absolutely credible. She is a very brave woman, and in fact, she has also obtained multiple security clearances issued by the U.S. government over many, many years.îHe continued, ìIf you read further in the declaration, are far more specific relating to Brett Kavanaughís conduct toward women in general, including the attempts to drug women by placing grain alcohol and/or drugs in the punch of many of these parties. Many of these women ended up gang raped, unfortunately. The details are specific. They are shocking. But above all else they are true. And my client stands behind them 100%, and sheís looking forward to having an opportunity to meet with one or more FBI agents hopefully, and describe what happened, and sheís also prepared to testify, if sheís permitted to do so, to the U.S. Senate. But under no circumstances should Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court until these allegations and others are vetted and all of the facts and the truth are known. You know, Brett Kavanaugh went on Fox a couple days ago and he stated that he wanted an opportunity to be heard. Well, heís had an opportunity to be heard. He can certainly have an opportunity to be heard further by the FBI and others. I want my client to have an opportunity to be heard. I want Dr. Ford to have an opportunity to be heard. And I want the corroborating witnesses to have an opportunity to be heard.îHe added, ìShe is willing to testify. Again, sheís willing to meet with the FBI forthwith immediately to describe what she witnessed. Sheís prepared to provide additional corroborating witnessesí names to the FBI associated with that investigation, and weíre hopeful that the committee is going to respond immediately by calling for an FBI investigation so that all of these allegations can be properly vetted and the truth can be known.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Following the publishing of this article, Twitter admitted the tweets were ìviolating our rules against abusive behavior,î but the post featuring a video of Sen.

We took this action based on new reports of Tweets and videos posted yesterday that violate our abusive behavior policy, in addition to the accountsí past violations,î declared Twitter this month. ìAs we continue to increase transparency around our rules and enforcement actions, we wanted to be open about this action given the broad interest in this case.îTwitter currently has hundreds of Antifa and openly pro-Antifa accounts on the social network, even though the group has been registered as a†domestic terrorist group in the United States.
Twitter also claimed last year that they would ìtake enforcement action against organizations that use/have historically used violence as a means to advance their cause,î but have refused to take action against pro-Antifa accounts.Following the publication of this article, Twitter did admit that the Antifa tweets were ìviolating our rules against abusive behavior,î however the tweet in this article remains on the site and no action appears to have been taken.The social network did not reply to a request for comment from Breitbart News.Update ó Shortly after the publication of this of this article, Twitter indicated via email that the ìSmash Racism DCî tweet is ìviolating our rules against abusive behavior,î but the tweet remains live on the platform.Charlie Nash is a reporter†for†Breitbart Tech.

She said she had been almost raped by someone who was now a federal judge. She told me she had been trapped in a room with two drunken guys, and that she had escaped, ran away and hid.îGildo-Mazzon, whose declaration states she has known Ford for over a decade, considers the professor a ìgood friend.îIn Fordís husbandís declaration, Russell alleges he was first made aware of the alleged incident ìaround the time we got marriedî and learned of further details during a 2012 marital therapy session.ìI remember her saying that her attackerís name was Brett Kavanaugh, that he was a successful lawyer who had grown up in Christineís home town, and that he was well-known in the†Washington D.C.†community,î he wrote.While discussing the sexual assault case of†Stanford University student Brock Turner,†Keith Koegler wrote in his declaration that Ford ìexpressed anger at Mr. Turnerís lenient sentence, stating that she was particularly bothered by it because she was assaulted in high school by a man who was now a federal judge in Washington, D.C.îìChristine did not mention the assault to me again until June 29, 2018, two days after Justice Anthony Kennedy announced his resignation from the Supreme Court of the United States,î†Koegler noted.In an email exchange, Koegler claims Ford alleged the individual who had sexually assaulted her was the frontrunner to replace Kennedy.ìI remember you telling me about him, but I donít remember his name.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/26/veteran-sex-crimes-prosecutor-rachel-mitchell-named-as-kavanaugh-hearing-questioner-left-immediately-attacks/,"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) announced Tuesday the identity of the female ìexperienced sex crimes prosecutorî who will question Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, at Thursdayís hearing: Phoenix, Arizonaís number two prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell.Mitchell was hired onto the Judiciary Committeeís roster of staff attorneys for this hearing, taking leave from her office in Phoenix, where she serves as†Maricopa Countyís Deputy County Attorney and division chief the County Attorneyís Officeís Special Victims Division, which handles sex crimes and domestic violence.Mitchell has served for 25 years as a prosecutor in the nationís fourth largest county, including 12 years at the head of the sex-crimes bureau.Grassleyís majority staff had already announced that, despite the protests of Fordís legal team, who evidently would have preferred the appearance of the all-male Republican senators questioning a lone woman, they would appoint a female attorney with specific experience handling sex abuse issues. Her identity, however, was kept private until Tuesday night.In a statement announcing Mitchell as the previously unnamed prosecutor, Grassley wrote:ìAs I have said, Iím committed to providing a forum to both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh on Thursday that is safe, comfortable and dignified. The majority members have followed the bipartisan recommendation to hire as staff counsel for the committee an experienced career sex-crimes prosecutor to question the witnesses at Thursdayís hearing. The goal is to de-politicize the process and get to the truth, instead of grandstanding and giving senators an opportunity to launch their presidential campaigns. Iím very appreciative that Rachel Mitchell has stepped forward to serve in this important and serious role. Ms. Mitchell has been recognized in the legal community for her experience and objectivity.Some commentators on the political left immediately criticized the pick, trying to tie Mitchell, who is an unelected civil servant, to the controversially convicted ó and now pardoned ó Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio.The Maricopa†County Attorneyís Office does not report to the Sheriffís Office. As in most counties nationwide, the Maricopa County Attorney is an independently elected official who runs his office independently, since 2010 Republican Bill Montgomery. Sheriff Arpaio at no time exercised authority over any aspect of the†County Attorneyís Office.The Washington Postís Never Trump blogger Jennifer Rubin, who is regularly identified as a ìconservativeî in media outlets despite distancing herself from the term, insulted Mitchell on Twitter shortly after the announcement, making this mistake:Only this crowd of clueless old white guys wold pick someone from Sheriff Joe's operation. I was saying no self-respecting lawyer would take the job of giving cover to GOP cowards. I was right.ó Jennifer Rubin (@JRubinBlogger) September 26, 2018Former Hillary Clinton adviser Philippe Reines made the same error:11 Fraidy Cat Republican *men* need a ringer to do their dirty work: Rachel Mitchell, 26 years in Arizonaís Maricopa County Attorneyís Office, will interrogate Ford, ask Kavanaugh his favorite color.

Rings a bell.OH, Joe Arpaio was sheriff for 25 of her 26 yrs. https://t.co/dRdz8Y0tFnó Philippe Reines (@PhilippeReines) September 26, 2018Some of the attacks on Mitchellís suitability focused on†controversies over inadequate Sheriffís Office sex-crime investigation under Arpaio last decade. Not only did Mitchell not work at the Sheriffís Office, she, as the†Washington Postís Tuesday report notes was, according to her predecessor Cindi Nannetti, ìone of the prosecutors tasked with finding out why hundreds of sex crimes were unresolved or not adequately investigated by the Maricopa County Sheriffís Office.îNannetti also told the Post that Mitchell was ìone of the finest prosecutors in the country.îDefense attorney Tracey Westerhausen, a self-identified Democrat who represented ìmore than 30î defendants Mitchell prosecuted, told the Post, ìPart of the reason weíre very good friends, she is a very nuanced and wise prosecutor. She doesnít pigeonhole defendants. In my experience, she is a very pointed questioner of adverse witnesses. But she is also very fair.î

Thereís nothing personal about any of this. Kavanaugh stands between the Democratic Party and the power it seeks. He is in the way. He must be crushed ñ in this case, along with his wife and his two little girls. Sorry, thatís the cost of winning.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/25/report-kavanaugh-accuser-ramirez-refuses-to-cooperate-with-senate-committee/,"Deborah Ramirez, the second women to level sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh, is refusing to cooperate in any way with the Senate Judiciary Committee.The Washington Examiner reports that Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA), a sitting member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told staffers Tuesday that Ramirez is refusing to cooperate in any way; she will not testify or even make a statement.Speaking of Ramirezís lawyer, Kennedy said, ìOur counsel repeatedly tried to reach him. They finally did reach him, and he said, ëWe are not issuing a statementí. He said, ëIf you want our statement, read the New Yorker.íîAccording to others present when Kennedy made these remarks, he added that the ìRead the New Yorkerî comment was not a direct quote, just the way he interpreted it.Any testimony given to the Committee, including a statement, would be considered under oath, which carries with it the risk of perjury and imprisonment. So far, everyone appears to agree that Ramirez has not issued a statement, nor has her attorney.The only statement she has made is to the New Yorker, which does not carry any penalty for perjury.For his part, according to the far-left Washington Post, Kavanaugh did speak to the Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and once again denied the Ramirez allegations. During this particular call, Kavanaugh is considered to be under oath and if he is lying would face disgrace, disbarment, and jail time.In a bombshell story co-authored by Ronan Farrow and published in the New Yorker Sunday, Ramirez alleged that during a drunken 1983 party in a Yale dorm room, when both she and the Supreme Court nominee were freshman, Kavanaugh aggressively flashed her.Ramirezís story quickly unraveled, though, and did so on the pages of the New Yorker.For starters, Farrowís in-depth reporting detailed Ramirezís memory problems. In part because she was so intoxicated on the night in question, for 35 years she could not remember who flashed her. It was only when Senate Democrats threatened to tell their version of the story and after she spent six days probing her memory with her attorney (a Democrat politician) that Ramirez agreed to name Kavanaugh.Memory issues are just the beginning of the problems with the Ramirez allegation. Every single person she named as a witness has either said the flashing incident never happened or they did not recall it happening.In other words, as is the case with Kavanaughís first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, all the named witnesses either say this never happened or they cannot remember it happening.As of now, whether or not Ford will testify under oath is also up in the air. After a week of delays and accommodations, Ford agreed to testify this Thursday. Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA), however, said on Tuesday that ìI have no way of knowingî if she will show up.Michael Avenatti, the attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels made famous by CNN, promised on Sunday that he had a third accuser who would come forward within 48 hours against Kavanaugh. On Tuesday, however, Avenatti not only appeared to walk back that promise, he also locked his Twitter account from public view.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.

She was 15 at the time, he was 17, and Ford claimed to have three witnesses.Now that the dreaded Patriarchy is finally coming down (whatever that means), letís ignore two of Fordís witnesses ó PJ Smyth and Mark Judge (who have ZERO recollection of this house party) because Ö they are men, and therefore members of that dreaded patriarchy. ButÖWhat about Leland Ingham Keyser?What about her?Ms. Kesyer is not only a woman and a Democrat, she is a lifelong friend of Fordís, and this female, lifelong friend of Fordís not only cannot remember ever attending this house party, she also says she never met Kavanaugh, and does not know him.Hey, if we are supposed to believe all womenÖKavanaughís second accuser is Deborah Ramirez, who claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken party in a Yale dorm in 1983. Ramirez says she was ìfoggyî drunk at the time and for 35 years could not remember who flashed her, but after talking to Senate Democrats and her Democrat lawyer for six days, she is now sure it was Kavanaugh.Two witnesses to the event named by Ramirez say it never happened. But they are both men, and therefore dreaded members of the patriarchy. ButÖWhat about Ramirezís best friend at Yale?What about her?She says of Ramirez, ìThis is a woman I was best friends with. We shared intimate details of our lives. And I was never told this story by her, or by anyone else. It never came up. I didnít see it; I never heard of it happening.îAnd what about Louisa Garry who ìRamirez alleged [was] involved in the incident?îHere is what she (and two additional men Ramirez claimed were involved) told the New Yorker:We were the people closest to Brett Kavanaugh during his first year at Yale. He was a roommate to some of us, and we spent a great deal of time with him, including in the dorm where this incident allegedly took place. Some of us were also friends with Debbie Ramirez during and after her time at Yale. We can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about itóand we did not. The behavior she describes would be completely out of character for Brett. In addition, some of us knew Debbie long after Yale, and she never described this incident until Brettís Supreme Court nomination was pending. Editors from the New Yorker contacted some of us because we are the people who would know the truth, and we told them that we never saw or heard about this.Garry added later, ìI never saw or heard anything like this.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/25/senate-judiciary-vote-kavanaugh/,"WASHINGTON, DC ñ The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a meeting on September 28, to vote on whether to recommend Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the full Senate for confirmation to the Supreme Court.The committee is currently scheduled to hear testimony under oath from Kavanaugh and his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, on Thursday. Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has hired a veteran prosecutor who specializes in sex crime cases to lead the questioning of both witnesses.While it appears certain that Kavanaugh will be there to testify, there are growing doubts ñ including from Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who initiated the whole affair ñ as to whether Ford will show up at all. (Ford was invited to testify, but is not under subpoena, and therefore has no legal obligation to appear and be placed under oath.)The Judiciary Committeeís rules require three daysí advance notice of any business meeting, so Grassley has issued that notice today if a majority of the committee is prepared to vote after Thursdayís hearing.Once the committee votes on the nomination, it goes to the majority leader ñ Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) who controls the Senate floor schedule for debates and votes. It is certain that McConnell will need to file a cloture motion to bring debate over President Trumpís second Supreme Court pick to a close and proceed to a vote.McConnell has already told senators to expect to stay in Washington on Saturday and even Sunday to move forward on the Kavanaugh nomination.The Supreme Court begins its annual term next Monday, October 1, at 10:00 a.m.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/25/lisa-murkowski-fbi-probe-would-clear-up-questions-about-brett-kavanaughs-past/,"Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) said Tuesday that an FBI investigation into Judge Brett Kavanaughís past would ìclear upî questions surrounding allegations of decades-old sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court nominee.The remark was made in response to a question by CNN senior†congressional correspondent Manu Raju, who asked the lawmaker if the FBI should probe Kavanaughís past, following allegations of sexual misconduct brought forth after the Supreme Court nominee emerged†unscathed from a series of contentious confirmation hearings. ìIt would sure clear up all the questions, wouldnít it?î†Murkowski reportedly told Raju.I just asked Sen. Lisa Murkowski, key GOP swing vote, if there should be a full FBI investigation into allegations from Kavanaughís past. ìIt would sure clear up all the questions, wouldnít it?î she saidó Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 25, 2018An investigation would likely center around decades-old allegations leveled by California psychology†professor Christine Blasey Ford, who alleges was forced into a room and groped by the Kavanaugh during a Maryland house party around 1982, a claim all named eyewitness†public state they have no knowledge of the incident every occurring. Fordís legal and members of Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley staffer reached a tentative agreement Saturday for the professor to testify before lawmakers Thursday. However, a letter sent to the chairman by Fordís attorneys Monday complained of the panelís hiring of an ìexperienced sex crimes prosecutorî to partake in the testimony, suggests the professor may renege†on the agreement.In new letter from Dr Fordís Attorney to the Judiciary Committee, they again object to having outside counsel ask the questions for republicans at Thursdayís hearing, and ask for the name and resume of who that person will be.This does not appear to be a done deal. pic.twitter.com/MwggIeBGbsó Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) September 25, 2018ìIn our view, the hiring of an unnamed ëexperienced sex crimes prosecutorí as Mr. Davis described in his email, is contrary to the Majorityís repeated emphasis on the need for the Senate and this Committeeís members to fulfill their constitutional obligations,î wrote lawyer†Michael Bromwich.†ìIt is also inconsistent with your stated wish to avoid a ëcircus,í as well as Dr. Blasey Fordís repeated requests through counsel that senators conduct the questioning. This is not a criminal trial for which the involvement of an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would be appropriate.îAnother allegation†Murkowski likely believes should be investigated†regards the†New Yorkerës Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer†report,†in which a†woman named Deborah Ramirez alleges that†drunken Kavanaugh, while a freshman at Yale University, ìexposed himselfî to her during a party. Among the pieceís key revelations, Farrow and Mayer were unable to ìconfirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party.îDespite saber-rattling from Democrats, chances of the FBI opening an investigation are slim.The Washington Post writes:The FBI conducts background checks for federal nominees but the agency does not make judgments on the credibility or significance of allegations, according to a Justice Department statement Monday. Instead, the department compiles information about the nomineeís past and provides its findings to the agency that requested the background check. In this case, that would be the White House.There has been no suggestion that Kavanaugh may have committed a federal crime, so the FBI would not conduct a criminal investigation. But Senate Democrats are pushing for the FBI to reopen Kavanaughís background investigation.Amid calls from Democrats to suspend the confirmation vote, Republican leadership is standing shoulder to shoulder with Kavanaugh. On Monday,†Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell lambasted Democrats for launching a ìsmear campaignî against the Trump pick.†ìSenate Democrats and their allies are trying to destroy a manís personal and professional life on the basis of decades-old allegations that are unsubstantiated and uncorroborated,î†he†said. ìThat,†Mr. President, is where we are. This is what the so-called resistance has become, a smear campaign, pure and simple, aided and abetted by members of the United States Senate.îIn a surprise sit-down interview with Fox News host†Martha MacCallum yesterday, Kavanaugh once again denied the allegations and called for ìfair process where I can defend my integrity.îìIíve never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise,î†Kavanaugh, flanked by his wife Ashley,†told†the Fox News host. ìI am not questioning, and have not questioned, that perhaps Dr. Ford, at some point in her life, was sexually assaulted by someone, in some place. But what I know is Iíve never sexually assaulted anyone.î

They should look in the mirror. Talk about undermining basic democratic norms of due process and the presumption of innocence. These are things that go back 800 years to the Magna Carta. And the Democrats, like Mazie Hirono or Richard Blumenthal or other senators, are essentially saying that Brett Kavanaugh is guilty simply because he faces an allegation, allegations in the New Yorker article, that are completely unsupported by any evidence and that, by the accuserís own admission, only came to her after she spent six days working with a former elected Democrat and her lawyer, and allegations from Ms. Ford that are disputed by the four people she claims were in the house at the time what she said happened, happened.îHe added, ìNow, sheíll have a chance to present her case on Thursday. But some of the statements by my Democratic colleagues truly, not just resemble McCarthyism, they resemble the kind of Stalinist show trials you saw in the Soviet Union, that merely making an accusation is enough if itís in the greater interests of the party and the state, as Mazie Hirono essentially said on Jake Tapperís show on Sunday.îFollow Ian†Hanchett on Twitter†@IanHanchett

He has answered six FBI background checks. This has been an incredibly open, transparent process. Republicans have been very fair to Democrats.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/25/vulnerable-senate-democrats-remain-open-supporting-brett-kavanaugh/,"Vulnerable Senate Democrats told reporters this week they continue to keep an open mind regarding their support for President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh.Several Senate Democrats up for re-election this year have remained open to supporting Judge Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court despite the sexual assault allegations brought against the presidentís nominee.Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) face three of the most competitive races this cycle and have continued to watch the accusations against Kavanaugh unfold before they give a decision regarding their support.Manchin told reporters on Monday, ìI want everybody to be able to tell their side of the story if itís validated, and I want him to have a chance to clear his name.îìI just want to hear all the facts, hear what everybody has to say,î†Sen. Donnelly said. He contended that he is not facing pressure to vote to confirm the nominee, stating, ìNo. Iíll just do whatís right, no matter what.îHeitkamp told reporters on Monday that the allegations need to be ìlooked into,î but he declined to elaborate. Rep. Kevin Cramer, Heitkampís Republican challenger, leads the North Dakota Democrat by four points according to a poll released this month.Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), who faces an increasingly tight race against Montana state auditor Matt Rosendale, still has policy questions for Kavanaugh.ìLook, weíre paying close attention to the allegations. Iíve got other issues, too, that I want to talk to him if we can ever get an in-person [meeting] with him,î Tester said, citing privacy, abortion, and campaign finance. ìWeíve got a long list. And these allegations will also be a part of it.îA survey last week found that Rosendale and Tester are in a virtual tie at 44 percent each.While Manchin, Heitkamp, and Donnelly face increasing pressure to back Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, they will likely not signal if they will support him until after he receives a 50-vote majority for Senate confirmation. The 50-vote majority largely rests upon Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Susan Collinsí (R-ME) supporting Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, but they will wait on deciding until they hear California psychology Professor Christine Blasey Fordís testimony about the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh.If Collins and Murkowski back Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, Manchin, Heitkamp, and Donnelly will face continued pressure to vote to confirm him.In contrast to the three Senate Democrats, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) announced last week she will vote against Kavanaugh, saying the accusation against him was ìtroublingî but did not factor into her decision against the nominee.McCaskill is considered one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats. A September poll found that Missouri State Attorney General Josh Hawley is now tied with her for the Missouri Senate race.McCaskill said that Kavanaugh ìhas revealed his bias against limits on campaign donations which places him completely out of the mainstream of this nation.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/25/kavanaugh-accusers-legal-team-still-not-satisfied-with-hearing-setup/,"Lawyers for Judge Brett Kavanaughís accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, sent another email to Senate Judiciary Committee staffers Monday night, indicating their displeasure with preparations for their clientís Thursday testimony.Among the issues raised in the email by new addition to the Ford legal team Michael Bromwich (pictured) include the announcement of a female ìexperienced sex crimes prosecutorî as outside counsel. Fordís lawyers have been objecting to Republicansí ability to use anyone by the all-male roster of GOP senators on the Judiciary Committee since their opening salvos last week.ìIn our view, the hiring of an unnamed ëexperienced sex crimes prosecutor,í as [committee staffer Mike] Davis described in his email, is contrary to the Majorityís repeated emphasis on the need for the Senate and this Committeeís members to fulfill their constitutional obligations,î Bromwich writes. ìThis is not a criminal trial for which the involvement of an experienced sex crimes prosecutor would be appropriate.îThe email also includes a new set of demands including a meeting with the as-of-yet unnamed prosecutor Tuesday as well as an explanation of her role and her resume. ìMr. Davis still has not responded to a number of†outstanding questions about the hearing, including an explanation of the role of the ìexperienced sex crimes prosecutorî in the Committee format,î Bromwich writes. ìPlease identify this person and ask your staff to send us her resume immediately. We respectfully request to meet with her tomorrow.îPrevious demands from Fordís legal team have included that Ford testify only after Kavanaugh has, denying him the ability to defend himself from her still-nebulous accusations.Given the repeated postponement on Fordís behalf of the hearing on Fordís allegation that a 17-year-old Kavanaugh groped her at a high school party 36 years ago, this latest salvo of objections had some commentators wondering if the hearing is again in jeopardy. As NBC Newsís Frank Thorp, who first reported the email in a tweet, expressed his doubts:In new letter from Dr Fordís Attorney to the Judiciary Committee, they again object to having outside counsel ask the questions for republicans at Thursdayís hearing, and ask for the name and resume of who that person will be.This does not appear to be a done deal. pic.twitter.com/MwggIeBGbsó Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) September 25, 2018Whether these new objections prove fatal to Thursdayís eagerly await hearing or not, it is scheduled for a smaller room in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, rather than the main Senate Judiciary Committee room on Fordís request, according to Fox Newsís Chad Pegram.† The witness list has also been published. It contains just two names: Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh.

Ramirezís college best friend also told the paper she ìnever heard ofî the incident in question.Jimmy Kimmel cut to a clip of Judge Kavanaugh and his wifeís Fox News interview on Monday, in which the Supreme Court nominee called allegations from Christine Blasey Ford false and explained that he was a virgin in high school and college.https://youtu.be/935PjmlOH5o?t=3m44sìThank you for admitting that,î Kimmel said in response to the Kavanaugh clip. ìHe was a virgin until many years after. So if he doesnít get to be on the Supreme Court, maybe heíll be The Bachelor.îKavanaugh has reportedly produced calendars from 1982, which purportedly prove he was out of town during the time in which Ford says he attempted to grope her at a house party.ìWhat 17-year-old keeps calendars of his social engagements?î Kimmel asked. ìNo wonder he was a virgin.îKimmel concluded his Kavanaugh monologue with a gruesome suggestion.ìHear me out on this,î Kimmel began ìSo Kavanaugh gets confirmed to the Supreme Court, OK?

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/kavanaugh-speaks-allegations-against-him/,"WASHINGTON, DC ó Judge Brett Kavanaugh spoke publicly on Monday for the first time since being accused of sexual misconduct, telling Fox News Channelís Martha McCallum that the accusations against him are categorically false, that he looks forward to clearing his name before the Senate, and that all he asks for is a fair process.Kavanaugh appeared with his wife Ashley on Fox Newsís†The Story, answering questions from McCallum ahead of his Thursday testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. At issue are allegations from Christine Blasey Ford, who said Kavanaugh groped her at a party when he was 17 years old, and from Deborah Ramirez, who said he exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party when they were freshmen together at Yale.Both womenís accounts are currently unraveling, with the five people Ford said were at the party in question all denying her account, and with more than a dozen people contacted regarding Ramirezís accusations likewise denying the second account.ìAll Iím asking for is fairness and that I be heard in this process,î Kavanaugh said early in the interview, a theme he would repeat several times to emphasize what he was looking for during this unexpected add-on part of his Senate confirmation process to the U.S. Supreme Court.Responding directly to the accusations against him, Kavanaugh was emphatic. ìIíve never sexually assaulted anyone ó not in high school, not ever,î he told McCallum.He noted that within 24 hours of being accused, 65 women who knew him as a student signed a letter affirming that he always conducted himself with grace and dignity and unfailingly acted as a gentleman around women.Nor did he think there was much opportunity to have interacted with Ford. ìWe did not travel in the same social circles,î the 53-year-old told McCallum.ìI was never at any such party,î Kavanaugh said of the event Ford described. ìThe other people who were alleged to be present say that they do not remember any such party.îThe judge also cited the fact that the other teenage young woman Ford named in her story, Leland Keyser, has publicly denied Fordís description of the party. ìShe doesnít know me and never remembers being at a party with me any time in her life,î he recounted from Keyserís response.Brettís wife Ashley was at his side during the interview†and explained why she did not believe these allegations.ìHeís decent. Heís kind,î Ashley asserted. ìHeís good. I know his heart.îRegarding the second accuser, Ramirez, Kavanaugh cut to the chase as to why many commentators think that Ramirez is crashing and burning only 24 hours after going public.ìThe New York Times†just reported that just last week, the person making the accusation was calling other classmates saying she was not sure that I had done this,î he explained. The Times chose not to run the story after they contacted more than a dozen people, none of whom could corroborate Ramirezís account that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a Yale party in which she admitted that she was severely drunk.The interview was uncomfortably candid when Kavanaugh explained that these playboy accusations did not fit the reality that, as a young man, he was something of a ìnerd,î a top student focused on academics rather than a ladyís man. ìI did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter,î he told McCallum.ìSo youíre saying, through all these years in question, you were a virgin?î McCallum asked, referencing the fact that it is uncomfortably unfortunate to have to discuss such intimate personal details in light of the accusations.ìThatís correct,î the judge confirmed.They elevated the discussion by focusing on the path forward by talking about what the nominee was looking for going forward.ìI want a fair process where I can defend my integrity,î Kavanaugh asserted.ìIím not going to let false accusations drive me out of this process,î he responded when McCallum explored whether he was willing to withdraw from the process. ìI have faith in God and faith in the fairness of the American people. America is about fairness, and hearing from both sides.îìI was first interviewed last Monday, the day after the allegation appeared,î the judge explained, ìunder penalty of felony, and I denied this categorically and unequivocally, and I said twice during that ó I want a hearing tomorrow.îìI want to clear my name as quickly as possible,î he declared.He admitted that he has his flaws but insisted that he is innocent of these accusations.ìI think everyone is judged on their whole life. Iím a good person,î Kavanaugh opined. ìIíve led a good life. Iíve tried to do a lot of good for a lot of people. I am not perfect. I know that. None of us is perfect. But Iíve never done anything like this.îAshley addressed the human toll of this ordeal. ìItís very difficult to have these conversations with your children,î she said.She told their two young daughters, ìJust remember, you know your dad.îReferencing the political reality of presidents who sometimes distance themselves from nominees who become problematic, McCallum asked Kavanaugh if President Donald Trump is going to stick with him.ìI know heís going to stand by me,î Kavanaugh responded, saying that the president had recently contacted him to assure him of his support. ìHe called me this afternoon.îThe Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hear from Kavanaugh this Thursday.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

For far too long, the safety and dignity of women was secondary to the needs of powerful men. But that era is done,î Timeís Upís statement continued. ìThe rules have changed. Thoughtful American citizens, regardless of political party, will not tolerate this man as an arbiter of justice on the nationís highest court.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/susan-collins-second-kavanaugh-accuser-should-speak-with-senate-investigators/,"Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) said on Monday evening that Deborah Ramirez, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her while they were students at Yale, should speak to Senate Judiciary Committee investigators under oath.ìI believe that the committee investigators should reach out to Deborah Ramirez to question her under oath about what she is alleging happened,î Collins reportedly said, according to The Hill.†Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) reportedly said on Monday evening that Ramirezís ìcounsel has not been terribly cooperative other than to say to read the New Yorker.îìOur majority staff has been in touch with Ms. Ramirezís counsel. We are told if we want to know the allegations, read the New Yorker. And thatís all theyíre willing to say,î Kennedy reportedly added.When asked if Ramirez should appear at Thursdayís scheduled hearing at which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaughís first accuser, are scheduled to appear, Collins reportedly said, ìNo, because there hasnít even been an interview of her yet and I think that needs to take place first.îDemocrats are trying to convince Collins, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) to consider voting against Kavanaugh in light of the sexual misconducted/attempted sexual assault allegations.Collins said on Friday evening that she will ìhave to be able to look in the mirrorî and say that she did what was the right thing when asked about Kavanaugh.ìIn the end I have to be able to look in the mirror and say I did what I thought was right,î Collins reportedly said at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire.Earlier on Friday, Collins said she was ìappalledî by President Donald Trumpís tweet in which he said that ìif the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents.îTrump added: ìI ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn† date, time, and place!îìI was appalled by the presidentís tweet. First of all, we know that allegations of sexual assault ñ Iím not saying thatís what happened in this case ñ but we know allegations of sexual assault are one of the most unreported crimes that exist,î Collins said. ìSo I thought that the presidentís tweet was completely inappropriate and wrong.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/report-trump-thinks-grassley-badly-handling-kavanaugh-accusers-demands/,"President Donald Trump is none too pleased with how Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley (R-IA) is handling demands made by attorneys for†Christine Balsey Ford, the California psychology†professor who is scheduled to testify Thursday about her decades-old sexual misconduct allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a new report says.According to the Washington Post, President Trump believes Grassley has been ìtoo accommodatingî towards Ford, and he has grown tired of the professorís legal team ìgetting their wayî when it comes to setting the terms of their clientís testimony.As Breitbart News reported, the chairman late Saturday evening granted yet another extension†to Fordís legal team to reply to a request that the accuser testify before lawmakers Wednesday. The following day, Fordís legal team convinced members of Grassleyís staff to allow their client to appear before the panel on Thursday. The tentative agreement came after lawyers for Ford accused the Republicans of being†ìfundamentally inconsistent with the committeeís promise of a fair, impartial investigation into her allegations.î Earlier this month, Ford publically detailed her allegation to the Washington Post, accusing Kavanaugh, then in high school, of forcing her into a room and groping her at a house party around 1982.The Post also reports that in the wake of allegations against Kavanaugh,†President Trump believes, ìRepublicans are too easily manipulated by Democrats,î a view widely shared by his supporters, who see the likes of Sens.†Mazie Hirono (D-HI) and†Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) as bad faith actors attempting to derail the Supreme Court nomineeís confirmation for purely political purposes. Further, a Republican with knowledge of the presidentís†discussions on the matter says†the White House ìdoes not believe [Fordís] accusations are credible.îìIn private talks, Trump has targeted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Grassley for criticism, complaining that they have not been forceful enough in speeding up the process and have been too deferential to Fordís attorneys, according to two people familiar with Trumpís concerns,î the Post reports.McConnell††vigorously defended†Kavanaugh in a†Senate floor speech Monday, accusing the Democrats of launching a ìsmear campaignî against the nominee, vowing the Trump will soon be confirmed to the Supreme Court.ìSenate Democrats and their allies are trying to destroy a manís personal and professional life on the basis of decades-old allegations that are unsubstantiated and uncorroborated,î†McConnell said. ìThat,†Mr. President, is where we are. This is what the so-called resistance has become, a smear campaign, pure and simple, aided and abetted by members of the United States Senate.îOne day after Ford tentatively agreed to testify, the New Yorkerës Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer reported that while a college freshman at Yale University, an inebriated Kavanaugh ìexposed himselfî to fellow student†Deborah Ramirez during a ìdrunken dormitory party.î Akin to Fordís allegation, Farrow and Mayer had no luck in corroborating Ramirezís claims.†ìThe New Yorker†has not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party.†The magazine contacted several dozen classmates of Ramirez and Kavanaugh regarding the incident. Many did not respond to interview requests; others declined to comment, or said they did not attend or remember the party,î the magazineís reporters wrote.Michael Avenatti, attorney for porn star Stormy Daniels and 2020 hopeful, claims to represent a third accuser who possesses†ìcredible informationî regarding Kavanaugh and has asked the committee to look into said evidence.†In an email to Mike Davis, Chief Counsel for Nominations for the Senate Judiciary Committee, the ìcreepy porn lawyerî wrote:†ìWe are aware of significant evidence of multiple house parties in the Washington, D.C. area during the early 1980s during which Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, and others would participate in the targeting of women with alcohol/drugs in order to allow a ëtrainí of men to subsequently gang rape them.îDespite the allegations and violent†threats against his family, Judge Kavanaughís resolve appears stronger than ever.In a sit-down interview with Fox News host†Martha MacCallum on Monday, Kavanaugh, with his wife Ashley by his side, vehemently†denied the decades-old allegations and asked for a ìfair process where I can defend my integrity.îìIíve never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise,î he told MacCallum. ìI am not questioning, and have not questioned, that perhaps Dr. Ford, at some point in her life, was sexually assaulted by someone, in some place. But what I know is Iíve never sexually assaulted anyone.î

Theyíve allowed themselves to be Mau-maued, if you will, by people like Sen. Hirono. Ö The Democrats would never support [Brett Kavanaugh], no matter what. What do they think theyíre going to do here?îCaddell noted an undermining of the idea of presumption of innocence: ìThis notion that youíre guilty until proven innocent, or first the verdict then the trial is like Alice in Wonderland ó ëOff with their heads!í ó is really disturbing. Ö It is out of control.îCaddell went on: ìI am appalled by this notion that everyone will be vulnerable all their lives to anyone who makes an accusation.îDemocrats had betrayed Christine Blasey Ford by leaking her identity, assessed Caddell.ìThey donít even care about their person,î surmised Caddell. ìIf they did, they never would have thrown [Christine Blasey Ford] under the bus. She is roadkill to them as long as they can accomplish their purpose, which is to stop the nomination because theyíre right and everyone else is wrong. Thatís why I fault the Republicans. This has been a joke since the beginning, in terms of how it was handled.îDemocrats would oppose Kavanaugh if Jesus Christ declared Kavanaughís innocence, quipped Caddell: ìThe Republicans have brought this on because they do not understand what they are dealing with. If the Lord Himself came down and announced that Kavanaugh was innocent, the Democrats would vote against him.îBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.Follow Robert Kraychik on†Twitter.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/female-experienced-sex-crimes-prosecutor-will-question-kavanaugh-accuser/,"Documents obtained Monday by Breitbart News indicate Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has enlisted an†ìexperienced sex-crimes prosecutorî to handle questioning at Thursdayís hearing on the 36-year-old sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.The prosecutor has not yet been publicly identified but the documents indicate she is a woman.The use of an outside counsel, a lawyer not normally attached to the Senate, for questioning in investigative hearings is not unusual. In the case of Christine Blasey Fordís accusation that a drunken 17-year-old Kavanaugh pulled her into a bedroom at a high school party with another teenager and groped her, however, the use of one has proved a major bone of contention.Fordís legal team, led by Democratic activist Deborah Katz and now joined by Bill Clinton era Justice Department Inspector General Michael Bromwich, has repeatedly demanded the Senate Judiciary Committee agree not to use a presumably female outside counsel in this hearing. Republican staffers on the committee have reportedly expressed concerns about the ìopticsî of the panel of 11 GOP senators, all men, conducting the questioning of a sexual assault accuser on their own.Evidently concerned with preserving those favorable optics, Fordís legal team, while urging continual delays and postponements for nearly a week, insisted on the Republican senators asking all questions of Ford on their own as a condition for Fordís testimony. Other demands included allowing Ford, the accuser, to testify after Kavanaugh, the accused ñ the exact opposite of centuries of Anglo-American legal tradition. Grassleyís staff called that request ìan affront to fundamental notions of due processî in their response Friday.As to Katzís demand to refrain from enlisting a female lawyer to question Ford, Grassleyís staff also stood their ground, writing, ìThere is no rule of the Senate or the Committee that precludes staff attorneys from asking witnesses questions. We reserve the option to have female staff attorneys, who are sensitive to the particulars of Dr. Fordís allegations and are experienced investigators, question both witnesses.îFordís legal team has been informed of the decision to use†an ìexperienced sex-crimes prosecutorî at Thursdayís hearing, now scheduled for 10:00 a.m.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/ronan-farrow-new-yorker-debunks-ramirez-allegation-against-kavanaugh/,"The New Yorkerís Ronan Farrow and his co-author Jane Mayer are under fire for publishing a second allegation of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. When you look at how thin the story is, that criticism might be valid.But Farrow (pictured, top right) and Mayer (pictured, top left) deserve credit for writing the full story ó a story that not only appears to debunk Deborah Ramirezís allegation but exposes how the institutional left is aggressively working behind the scenes to destroy Kavanaugh with spurious accusations.After 35 years of not being sure it was him, Ramirez now alleges that during a drunken dorm party during her and Kavanaughís freshman year at Yale in 1983, he exposed himself to her in such an aggressive way she ended up accidentally touching his genitals.Obviously, this is a sensational allegation, and the timing is more than a little suspicious. The story appeared on Sunday night just as Christine Blasey Fordís allegations against Kavanaugh began to unravel.Just a few hours earlier, the last of Fordís three witnesses, including a lifelong friend, had not only said (under penalty of imprisonment) they do not recall any misconduct on Kavanaughís part, they do not even recall attending the 1982 house party where the misconduct supposedly occurred.If anything, though, Ramirezís story is even less credible.Like Ford, neither of Ramirezís witnesses recall the party or the alleged incident, nor does her best friend. Whatís more, until Ramirez spent six days with her Democrat lawyer, she was unable to identify Kavanaugh as the man who exposed himself.Because of Ramirezís memory problems (she was also quite drunk at the alleged party) and her supposed witnesses stating none of this ever happened, some argue the New Yorker was irresponsible to publish. In fact, the New York Times found the story so lacking in credibility, the paper chose not to publish.But were it not for the New Yorker, we would not have learned how Democrats are willing to manipulate events behind the scenes in their ongoing effort to destroy Kavanaugh with unsubstantiated allegations from more than 30 years ago.The New Yorker informs us:In her initial conversations with†The New Yorker, she was reluctant to characterize Kavanaughís role in the alleged incident with certainty. After six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, Ramirez said that she felt confident enough of her recollections to say that she remembers Kavanaugh†had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away.In other words, a full 35 years after the incident occurred, Ramirez (who the New Yorker describes as an activist Democrat) could not put the finger on Kavanaugh as the alleged flasher.Moreover, we learn ìRamirez acknowledged that there are significant gaps in her memories of the eveningî and that at the party she ìbecame inebriatedî and ìwas on the floor, foggy and slurring her words.îNevertheless, after all this time, over the past few days, she became sure it was Kavanaugh thanks to ìcarefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney.îThanks to the New Yorkerís in-depth reporting, however, we know exactly who the attorney is who helped Ramirez recall her memory ó ìStanley Garnett, a former Democratic district attorneyî from Boulder,†Colorado.And then there is the role Senate Democrats playedÖAppearing on Good Morning America Monday, Farrow disclosed that Senate Democrats instigated this by reaching out to Ramirez, who had no intention of reporting the incident because she was not sure it was Kavanaugh. One of the primary reasons she came forward, according to Farrow, is that she feared Democrats would tell the story for her.ìShe felt it was important that she tell her story before others did without her consent because so many people on [Capitol] Hill were looking at this,î Farrow said.Farrow also admitted there are no eyewitnesses of this incident.In fact, as the New Yorker reports, the two people named by Ramirez as witnesses state the incident never happened:One of the male classmates who Ramirez said egged on Kavanaugh denied any memory of the party. ìI donít think Brett would flash himself to Debbie, or anyone, for that matter,î he said. Asked why he thought Ramirez was making the allegation, he responded, ìI have no idea.î The other male classmate who Ramirez said was involved in the incident commented, ìI have zero recollection.îAdditionally, Ramirezís own best friend at the time says she knew nothing about this:ìThis is a woman I was best friends with. We shared intimate details of our lives. And I was never told this story by her, or by anyone else. It never came up. I didnít see it; I never heard of it happening.î She said she hadnít spoken with Ramirez for about ten years, but that the two women had been close all through college, and Kavanaugh had remained part of what she called their ìlarger social circle.î In an initial†conversation with†The New Yorker, she suggested that Ramirez may have been politically motivated. Later, she said that she did not know if this was the case.Then there are the three classmates who also back Kavanaughís claim:Dino Ewing, Louisa Garry, and Dan Murphy, disputed Ramirezís account of events: ìWe were the people closest to Brett Kavanaugh during his first year at Yale. He was a roommate to some of us, and we spent a great deal of time with him, including in the dorm where this incident allegedly took place. Some of us were also friends with Debbie Ramirez during and after her time at Yale. We can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about itóand we did not. The behavior she describes would be completely out of character for Brett. In addition, some of us knew Debbie long after Yale, and she never described this incident until Brettís Supreme Court nomination was pending. Editors from the New Yorker contacted some of us because we are the people who would know the truth, and we told them that we never saw or heard about this.îThe only person backing Ramirez is someone who refuses to be named and who allegedly heard about the flashing incident through a second-hand source:A classmate of Ramirezís, who declined to be identified because of the partisan battle over Kavanaughís nomination, said that another student told him about the incident either on the night of the party or in the next day or two. The classmate said that he is ìone-hundred-per-cent sureî that he was told at the time that Kavanaugh was the student who exposed himself to Ramirez.During her own appearance on CBS This Morning, Mayer stated that this person was not a witness, but someone who ìheard it from someone who was there.î But we do not know who that someone is, and both the†New Yorker and the New York Times aggressively tried to reach out to anyone who was part of this circle.Another former student remembered hearing about an incident regarding an exposed penis but did not remember either Kavanaugh or Ramirez being attached to it:Richard Oh, an emergency-room doctor in California, recalled overhearing, soon after the party, a female student tearfully recounting to another student an incident at a party involving a gag with a fake penis, followed by a male student exposing himself. Oh is not certain of the identity of the female student.But again, the only actual witnesses told the New Yorker it never happened, that Kavanaugh did no such thing, and that they witnessed no such thing.Kavanaugh himself unequivocally denies the incident and called it a ìsmear.îFor its part, on Monday morning, the left-wing New York Times corroborated the New Yorkerís reporting about Ramirezís own witnesses contradicting her account, plus her troubling memory issues:The Times had interviewed several dozen people over the past week in an attempt to corroborate her story, and could find no one with firsthand knowledge. Ms. Ramirez herself contacted former Yale classmates asking if they recalled the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr. Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself.Bottom line: reporting from both the New Yorker and the New York Times not only back up Kavanaughís claim he is innocent but every witness named by his accusers also back up Kavanaugh.Meanwhile, despite the facts, Democrats are still working behind the scenes to turn a fuzzy 35-year-old memory into one that perfectly fits their agenda to destroy this man.Had the New Yorker not published the complete story, we would not know any of this, and I cannot think of anything more newsworthy.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

If Grassley waits long enough, the Democrats will come up with the woman claiming to be Kavanaughís secret Russian wife. ó heís a bigamist, too, donít you know ó and Trump paid Kavanaughís second wife to hire a bunch of prostitutes to urinate on the bed Obama slept in while in Moscow.If Grassley doesnít get a handle on this and just do ó and Iíll tell you something else, which everybody also knows.

Youíve demonstrated that you donít hate women.Youíve demonstrated that youíre other open-minded. Youíve demonstrated that youíre gonna hear from her. Youíre never gonna hear from her! Sheís never gonna show up. Sheís not telling a story that can be verified, Senator Grassley. Sheís not gonna show up. If you guys donít conduct this vote in defiance of all this and if Avenatti gets one foot in the door to a Senate committee to start telling his story, then you can kind of kiss good-bye Republican chances in the midterms in November.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/flashback-chuck-schumer-pledged-oppose-kavanaugh-everything-i-have/,"Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) promised he would launch an aggressive anti-Brett Kavanaugh campaign, saying he would oppose ìJudge Kavanaughís nomination with everythingî he has, which he stated the same day in July that President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.On July 9, President Trump announced Judge Brett Kavanaugh as his nominee for the Supreme Court. The same day, Schumer announced that he planned to launch an aggressive campaign to oppose Kavanaughís nomination. He would do it, he said, ìwith everything I haveî because the ìstakes are simply too highî:I will oppose Judge Kavanaughís nomination with everything I have, and I hope a bipartisan majority will do the same. The stakes are simply too high for anything less. Read my full statement on #WhatsAtStake: https://t.co/BYtcB3LWWB  #StopKavanaugh pic.twitter.com/5f2Bomxltbó Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) July 10, 2018ìIím calling on Americans from all walks of life to make their voices heard from now until the end of this battle,î Schumer said.The New York Democrat continued:This nomination could alter the balance of the court in favor of powerful special interests and against working families for a generation and would take away labor, civil, and human rights from millions of Americans. We cannot let that happen. If we can successfully block this nomination, it could lead to a more independent, moderate selection that both parties could support [Emphasis added].Soon after Schumerís statements, reports emerged regarding Senate Democratsí tactics to delay and disrupt the Senate confirmation process. During the Senate Judiciary Committeeís confirmation hearings, many leftist protesters shouted and disrupted the proceedings. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) admitted†he and Senate Democrat leadership participated in conference calls to coordinate with leftist protesters to disrupt the hearings.Immediately after the hearings, Senate Judiciary Committee ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) referred a letter to the FBI that led the Washington Post to reveal that Christine Blasey Ford, a California psychologist, accuses Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both in high school.Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) subsequently delayed the committeeís confirmation vote to hold a hearing with Kavanaugh and Ford. Grassley scheduled the hearing for this Thursday.On Sunday, the New Yorker broke an accusation from Deborah Ramirez, a woman claiming that as a Yale University 18-year-old freshman, Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a drunken party. Ramirez reportedly spent six days discussing this with her lawyer before she was certain it was Kavanaugh.Sen. Feinstein then said that in light of the second accusation against Kavanaugh, the Thursday hearing should be canceled to investigate all of the claims against the Supreme Court nominee:Thursday's hearing should be canceled in light of a disturbing new allegation of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh. The FBI must investigate ALL allegations.ó Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) September 24, 2018Ranking member Feinstein then wrote a letter to chairman Grassley demanding additional delays and investigations into the accusations:I am writing to request an immediate postponement of any further proceedings related to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. I also ask that the newest allegations of sexual misconduct be referred to the FBI for investigation and that you join our request for the White House to direct the FBI to investigate the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford as well as these new claims.Similarly to Feinstein, Schumer called for an independent background check to investigate the sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh. Schumer asked rhetorically, ìIf President Trump and Senate Republicans are so certain the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh arenít true, then why are they blocking the FBI from reopening the background check and investigatingóa routine practice for judicial nominees?îSchumer added, ìWhat are they hiding?î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/24/every-witness-named-kavanaughs-accusers-sides-kavanaugh/,"The two women making sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh claim to have witnesses, but so far, all of their witnesses back Kavanaughís claim that nothing happened.It might be difficult to remember this as Democrats and the media throw around phrases like ìsecond accuserî and ìattempted sexual assaultî and ìexposing himselfî against the Supreme Court nominee. But the facts are still the facts, and every single witness named so far by both accusers say they witnessed nothing of the sort.The first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, is accusing Kavanaugh of attempting to assault her at a house party in 1982 when she was 15 and he was 17. She named three people who were at the party: PJ Smyth, Mark Judge, and Leland Ingham Keyser.By submitting their respective statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee, all three witnesses did so under penalty of imprisonment, and all three have zero recollection of the house party in question.The one witness whom Ford said was in the room when the alleged misconduct took place (Mark Judge) denies it happened. Moreover, another witness, a lifelong friend of Fordís, not only cannot remember the house party, she says she has never met Kavanaugh.PJ Smyth:I understand that I have been identified by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as the person she remembers as ìPJî who supposedly was present at the party she described in her statements to the Washington Post. I am issuing this statement today to make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh. Personally speaking, I have known Brett Kavanaugh since high school and I know him to be a person of great integrity, a great friend, and I have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women.Mark Judge†said, ìI have no memory of the alleged incident. Brett Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school but I do not recall the party described in Dr. Fordís letter. More to the point, I never saw Brett act in the manner Ford describes.îLeland Ingham Keyser stated, ìSimply put, Ms. Keyser does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without, Dr. Ford.îThe above is an email that Keyserís attorney, Howard Walsh, sent to the Judiciary Committee.Furthermore, Keyser is the ex-wife of Democrat operative Bob Beckel and currently produces his podcast. According to public reports, she has only ever donated to Democrats. The far-left CNN reports that Keyser and Ford are ìlifelong friends.îFor his own part, and under penalty of imprisonment, Kavanaugh not only denies any allegation that he acted improperly with Ford (or anyone), he denies being at this party ó a party no one other than Ford remembers.A second accuser came forward Sunday night in a piece the New Yorkerís Ronan Farrow co-authored. Deborah Ramirez alleges that an 18-year-old Kavanaugh exposed himself to her during a drunken 1983 dorm party at Yale.By any standard, this story is a mess, including Ramirezís own ìrecollection.î She admits she was drinking heavily at the party and that there are ìsignificant gaps in her memory of the evening.îWhen the New Yorker†first contacted Ramirez, she said she could not say if it was Kavanaugh who exposed himself. But after ìsix days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, Ramirez said that she felt confident enough of her recollections to say that she remembers Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party.îThe New Yorker added that it ìhas not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party.îIn other words, like the Ford allegation, the New Yorker is not only unable to verify that Kavanaugh exposed himself, none of the witnesses can confirm Kavanaugh even attended the party.The only so-called corroboration comes from an anonymous source who claims to have heard the story second hand. He says, ìAnother student told him about the incident either on the night of the party or in the next day or two.î Another former classmate remembers hearing something about this but has no recollection of who was involved.But the witnesses Ramirez actually named say nothing happened:Witness 1:One of the male classmates who Ramirez said egged on Kavanaugh denied any memory of the party. ìI donít think Brett would flash himself to Debbie, or anyone, for that matter,î he said. Asked why he thought Ramirez was making the allegation, he responded, ìI have no idea.îWitness 2: stated, ìThe other male classmate who Ramirez said was involved in the incident commented, ëI have zero recollection.íîClassmates 3, 4, and 5:In a statement, two of those male classmates who Ramirez alleged were involved in the incident, the wife of a third male student she said was involved, and three other classmates, Dino Ewing, Louisa Garry, and Dan Murphy, disputed Ramirezís account of events: ìWe were the people closest to Brett Kavanaugh during his first year at Yale. He was a roommate to some of us, and we spent a great deal of time with him, including in the dorm where this incident allegedly took place. Some of us were also friends with Debbie Ramirez during and after her time at Yale. We can say with confidence that if the incident Debbie alleges ever occurred, we would have seen or heard about itóand we did not. The behavior she describes would be completely out of character for Brett. In addition, some of us knew Debbie long after Yale, and she never described this incident until Brettís Supreme Court nomination was pending. Editors from the New Yorker contacted some of us because we are the people who would know the truth, and we told them that we never saw or heard about this.îRamirezís best friend at Yale:ìThis is a woman I was best friends with. We shared intimate details of our lives. And I was never told this story by her, or by anyone else. It never came up. I didnít see it; I never heard of it happening.î She said she hadnít spoken with Ramirez for about ten years, but that the two women had been close all through college, and Kavanaugh had remained part of what she called their ìlarger social circle.îIn a statement released Sunday, Kavanaugh called the Ramirez allegation a ìsmear, plain and simple,î and added (accurately), ìPeople who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so.îOnce you separate the media sensationalism and the political posturing from the actual facts, what we have here is a remarkable situation where every witness named by Kavanaughís accusers Ö sides with Kavanaugh.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

If you read Mark Judge, the alleged accomplice in the first assault, the world he describes at Georgetown Prep of really absurd amounts of drinking, weird hostility towards women. Itís all of a piece. It is all consistent with one another. Are they all lies? Perhaps, but it certainly has a ring of truth to me. Ö The question is what are people going to do with this?

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/23/ramirez-yale-classmates-deny-kavanaugh-allegations/,"WASHINGTON, DC ñ The second woman accusing Judge Brett Kavanaugh of inappropriate drunken behavior, Deborah Ramirez, admits ìsignificant gaps in her memoriesî regarding the college party in question. Critics note her allegations come after six days of consulting with a Democratic lawyer, other persons she claims were at the party deny her account, and even her college best friend admits, ìI never heard of it.îDespite focused efforts by Democratic political operatives and left-wing lawyer Debra Katz, the recent account of Christine Blasey Ford appears to be unraveling. Each of the four people she claimed to be present at a 1982 party where she claimed an intoxicated 17-year-old Kavanaugh groped her have either denied her account or said they have no knowledge of it.As that line of attack on President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court nominee falters, another Democrat-supported accuser has suddenly emerged.While allegedly heavily drinking in 1983 at a party when she and Kavanaugh were freshmen at Yale, Ramirez told the New Yorker†that she ìbecame inebriatedî and ìwas on the floor, foggy and slurring her wordsî during the event in question.ìRamirez acknowledged that there are significant gaps in her memories of the evening,î the left-wing magazine explains. ìHer memories contained gaps because she had been drinking at the time of the alleged incident.î However, after she had been coached for six days by a lawyer who is a former Democratic local elected official, ìRamirez said that she felt confident enough of her recollections to say that she remembers Kavanaugh had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party.îIndividuals she said were present at the time deny her accusations today, the New Yorker†acknowledges. ìOne of the male classmates who Ramirez said egged on Kavanaugh denied any memory of the party. ëI donít think Brett would flash himself to Debbie, or anyone, for that matter,í he said.îìI have no recollection,î said a second person she claimed was an eye-witness.The New Yorker†admits that it ìhas not confirmed with other eyewitnesses that Kavanaugh was present at the party.îFour Yale graduates who were friends with both Kavanaugh and Ramirez said ìwith confidenceî if the episode had ever occurred, they ìwould have seen or heard about itóand we did not.î They add that it ìwould be completely out of character for Brett,î and the first Ramirez said anything about it was when Kavanaugh was nominated for the Supreme Court.ìThis is a woman I was best friends with. We shared intimate details of our lives,î added another woman, whose wedding both Ramirez and Kavanaugh attended. ìAnd I was never told this story by her, or by anyone else. It never came up. I didnít see it; I never heard of it happening.îKavanaugh is also denying the allegation:This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen. The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. This is a smear, plain and simple. I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name ñ and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building ñ against these last-minute allegations.The White House is standing by Kavanaugh. Officials note that Sen. Mazie Hironoís (D-HI) quote in the New Yorker†story shows that Democratic senators are colluding with media outlets to create news stories against the judge instead of working with the Senate Judiciary Committee when they become aware of issues.Outside groups are likewise pushing back hard against this latest attack. Judicial Crisis Network Chief Counsel Carrie Severino said in a statement:Senate Republicans must not allow unsubstantiated and discredited allegations from over three decades ago to destroy the life and reputation of a good man. Countless people from every phase of Brett Kavanaughís life have testified that he is a good man of the highest character and integrity. Chuck Schumer vowed to oppose Kavanaugh with everything heís got, and apparently that took the form of character assassination. This has all of the ingredients of a smear campaign on steroids. Senate Republicans should stand up to these unsubstantiated and discredited allegations and move forward with a vote to confirm Kavanaugh.Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) currently plans to hold a hearing on Kavanaughís nomination on Thursday, September 27.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

Many did not respond to interview requests; others declined to comment, or said they did not attend or remember the party.îOne classmate of Ramirez, who declined to be named, said that he was told later about the party and that he remembered being told that Kavanaugh had behaved as described. Others had apparently also heard similar stories but not the names of those involved.However, a woman who described herself as Ramirezís best friend at the time told the New Yorker that she never heard about the story: ìI was never told this story by her, or by anyone else. It never came up. I didnít see it; I never heard of it happening.îFarrow and Mayer also explore other allegations about wild behavior involving ìKavanaugh and his social scene,î without connecting him to further allegations.They note that Kavanaugh had previously told the Senate Judiciary Committee, in response to a standard question from Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) that he had never committed any sexual misconduct as a ìlegal adult.î Kavanaugh would have been 18 at the time of the alleged incident.Read the full story here.Joel B.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/23/5-more-dirty-tricks-democrats-could-still-try-to-derail-brett-kavanaugh/,"Democrats are determined to sink Judge Brett Kavanaughís nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court even if Christine Blasey Fordís original accusation unravels ó as it is beginning to do, with all four named witnesses thus far contradicting her story.But the left is not above dirty tricks ó such as failing to mention the accusation against Kavanaugh until after the confirmation hearings ó and there are several more Democrats could pull that might have the potential to block Kavanaugh regardless.1. Create additional accusations. Even assuming that Dr. Fordís story is true, one of the problems that Democrats have faced is that Kavanaugh has shown no similar pattern of behavior. But if one or more new accusers emerged, that could create new suspicions that would at least delay his confirmation. The accusations would not need to be true; they would just need to cast the judge in a negative light. (Sunday nightís ìdildoî story, apparently in the works from the New Yorker,†is a perfect example.)2. Instigate a local prosecution. If state or county prosectors were to announce that they were investigating Kavanaugh for attempted rape, which has no statue of limitations in Maryland, that could end his confirmation. If that sounds far-fetched, State Sen. Cheryl Kagan (D-Montgomery) has already tried it, urging Gov. Larry Hogan to order an investigation by state police. He refused, but prosectors in the office of the Montgomery County stateís attorney ó a Democrat ó are noncommittal.3. Block the hearing.†Fordís claims could look less credible by Thursday. Kavanaugh reportedly produced calendars from 1982 on Sunday showing he was out of town for much of the period in question. If so, Democrats might not want Ford to testify ó but might want to delay a committee vote. They†praised the protesters who interrupted Kavanaughís confirmation hearing earlier this month; they could arrange massive protests during or before the hearing to disrupt it and delay the process.4. Organize a Bar protest. The left-leaning American Bar Association (ABA) gave Kavanaugh a unanimous ìwell-qualifiedî rating before his confirmation hearings. But Democrats could organize left-leaning lawyers to pressure the ABA to revise that conclusion, or to issue a statement of protest. Alternatively, they could organize a ìlawyersí protestî of their own, stating that they will refuse to argue cases before the Supreme Court so long as Kavanaugh is seated without a full FBI investigation.5. Character assassination.†If Fordís story falls apart, the campaign against Kavanaugh will go down as one of the worst smear campaigns in American history. But Democrats have time to make it even worse. They can ratchet up the pressure on the judge and his family to the point where he concludes it is simply not worth the effort. Already, the†Washington Post is reporting that Kavanaugh refused to answer some personal questions in mock hearings ó hinting, perhaps, at worse to come.Joel B.

Fallout from Hurricane Florence! Surely this would be a bad week for Trump. But at every turn, the establishment media fell on their faces trying to pin down Trump, telling bald-faced lies, fostering strange obsessions, and making gross analogies that exposed them†as dishonest and ridiculous.The week started out with CNN host Anderson Cooper dedicating almost 10 minutes to ìdebunkingî a tweet from Donald Trump Jr.Last weekend, Trump Jr. posted a story from Breitbart News about CNNís falling ratings (written by this reporter), along with a photo of Anderson Cooper standing in waist-deep water while his camera crew was on much higher ground.The photo was not from the recent Hurricane Florence, but was actually from Hurricane Ike in 2008.Though some Twitter users falsely claimed otherwise, Trump Jr. never once claimed the photo was from Florence.On Monday night, Cooper dedicated a long-winded segment to ìdebunkingî Trump Jr.ís tweet, and later followed up by tweeting, ìwhat are the chances DonaldJTrumpJr apologizes for lying about me? Im not holding my breath.îwhat are the chances @DonaldJTrumpJr apologizes for lying about me? Im not holding my breath. Check out the video below rebutting his false claim. https://t.co/r8fRX7VM3eó Anderson Cooper (@andersoncooper) September 18, 2018During his monologue, Cooper said:ìNow, over the weekend, however, the son of the president, Donny Jr., tweeted out this picture of me in waist high water, my camera crew, a few feet away, on higher ground, in only a little bit of water.†Donny Jr. was claiming it showed me in Florence faking the depths of flood waters in order to somehow harm his father.†And I quote from his tweet ëstop lying to try to make @realDonaldTrump look bad.'îThis is a total lieóTrump Jr. never said that the photo was from Florence.Trump Jr. responded on Twitter, accusing CNN of ìCrying & Lying.îCNN doing what they do best.

Par for the course. I never said the pic of him was from Florence. When I tweeted out the picture of AC360 it was with a link to an article about CNNís dwindling ratings.

Stormy Danielsí new book about her life is not that book. Wow. She tells all,î Tapper said to introduce the segment.During the piece, CNN correspondent Sara Sidner recalls how Daniels describes Trumpís penis.ìWhen Daniels came out of the bathroom, she claims Trump was lying on the bed in his underwear. They had sex.†She then describes his genitalia in great detail. ëHis penis is distinctive in a certain way,í she writes.†Proof, her attorney Michael Avenatti says, she is tired of being called a liar by Trumpís people.îLate night hosts also went into full obsession mode over Trumpís genitals, with Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, and Seth Meyers all dedicating bits to Trumpís penis.Finally, in reporting on the controversy surrounding allegations made against Brett Kavanaugh, many in the media catapulted themselves into full dishonesty mode.CNNís Jim Acosta played a blatantly misleading video clip of a speech Brett Kavanaugh gave in 2015.Jim Acosta on the 2015 Kavanaugh clip (which CNN edits so it begins after the reference to his three male friends): ìThere are portions of his childhood heíd rather not come to light."" Note how even Susan Hennessy thinks he's reaching. pic.twitter.com/swDqI2YcHhó Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 18, 2018Meanwhile, CNNís Chris Cillizza lied in a tweet, falsely accusing Trump of ìtelling the FBI to ignore an allegation of sexual assault.îNo big deal: Just the president telling the FBI to ignore an allegation of sexual assault https://t.co/lvO8w9ccOmó Chris Cillizza (@CillizzaCNN) September 18, 2018As Breitbart Newsí John Nolte wrote:To begin with, in his statement, all the president did was reiterate what the FBI has already said. On†two occasions, through the Department of Justice, and independent of Trump, the FBI accurately pointed out that their agency does not investigate local sexual misconduct allegations, especially ones that happened 36 years ago when both parties were still teenagers in high school.The worst part of Cillizzaís lie, though, is that if you look at Trump ës precise words, he actually said he would support the FBI had they decided to get involved ó which is the exact opposite of ìtelling the FBI to ignoreî the matter.ìI donít think the FBI really should be involved because they donít want to be involved,î Trump said, adding, ìif they wanted to be I would certainly do that, but as you know they say this is not really their thing.îFinally, a number of Republican women bucked the narrative and defended Brett Kavanaugh to CNN reporter†Randi Kaye during a segment that aired on Anderson Cooper 360 Thursday.ìBecause one woman made an allegationñsorry, I donít buy it,î one woman told CNNís Kaye.†Kaye asked the group of women, ìWhy would she come forward if this wasnít true? Because it has basically destroyed her family. Sheís had to move. Sheís gone undercover. Sheís gotten death threats. So if sheís lying, why come forward?îìSheís also destroying his life, his wifeís life, his childrenís lives. His career. I mean, why didnít she come out sooner if sheís telling the truth?î a woman named†Irina Villarino responded.MSNBCís Chris Hayes closed off the week by sending an unhinged tweet comparing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court to rape on Friday.ìSo even though Dr Ford is saying please stop, slow down, Iím not comfortable with the way this is going, the GOP is gonna plow through, ignore her telling them to stop and just take what they think is rightfully theirs?î Hayes tweeted.So even though Dr Ford is saying please stop, slow down, Iím not comfortable with the way this is going, the GOP is gonna plow through, ignore her telling them to stop and just take what they think is rightfully theirs?ó Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) September 22, 2018No wonder why many distrust the media more than ever.Itís a shame that CNNís ratings are down 41%.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/23/hirono-refuses-to-say-kavanaugh-has-presumption-of-innocence-women-need-to-be-believed/,"Sunday on CNNís ìState of the Union,î Senate Judiciary Committee member Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI)†refused to say Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh is presumed innocent†regarding the allegation by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.Partial transcript as follows:TAPPER: The ìWall Street Journalî editorial board wrote a piece about the presumption of guilt, they say. They quoted you directly to argue that a core tenet of American law is not being applied to Kavanaugh. They write, quote, ìThe Democratic standard for sexual assault allegations is, they should be accepted as true merely for having been made. The accuser is assumed to be telling the truth because the accuser is a woman. The burden is on Mr. Kavanaugh to prove his innocence. This turns American justice and due process upside down. Whatís your response?HIRONO: If ìThe Wall Street Journalî really cares about due process, I would say that they should care that there is no independent investigation of these allegations. I think that this kind of attitude is what makes it really difficult for victims and survivors of these kinds of traumatic events to even come forward. You know, we donít seem to have come very far from the Anita Hill days. But, as I said, for ìThe Wall Street Journalî to come out and talk to us about, talk to me about due process, or all the women out there that Iím hearing about who never came forward, it is really important, not only for these survivors to be heard, but if their stories are credible, as Dr. Fordís story is, they need to be believed.TAPPER: So, four people said to be at the party Ford described have denied knowledge of the incident, Brett Kavanaugh, obviously, Mark Judge, who she says was in the room, P.J. Smith, and even Fordís longtime friend Leland Keyser. So there hasnít been a law enforcement investigation, but there are these statements from the four people she remembers being there who donít remember the incident or donít even remember being at the party in question, according to her friend Leland Keyser, who says she believes herÖHIRONO: Yes.TAPPER: Ö but doesnít have any memory of it.HIRONO: Yes.TAPPER: Doesnít Kavanaugh have the same presumption of innocence as anyone else in America?HIRONO: I put his denial in the context of everything that I know about him in terms of how he approaches his cases. As I said, his credibility is already very questionable in my mind and in the minds of a lot of my fellow Judiciary Committee members, the Democrats. So he comes, and ó when I say that heís very outcome-driven, he has an ideological agenda, is very outcome-driven. And I can sit here and talk to you about some of the cases that exemplifies his, in my view, inability to be fair in the cases that come before him. This is a person that is going to be sitting on our Supreme Court, making decisions that will impact womenís reproductive choice. He has a ó he very much is against womenís reproductive choice.TAPPER: Mm-hmm.HIRONO: And I can tell you two very important cases in which he applied the same standard, but came to totally different results to make it much harder for women to get this kind of coverage. So thereís ó there are so many indications of his own lack of credibility. And I put that in a context.TAPPER: It sounds to me like youíre saying, because you donít trust him on policy and because you donít believe him when he says, for instance, that he does not have an opinion on Roe v. Wade, you donít believe him about this allegation about what happened at this party in 1982? Is that fair?HIRONO: Well, without ó this is why it is so important that there be at least an investigation, so that thereís some effort at collaboration. And we think that there was a lot of drinking going on. As far as the friend, his friend Mark Judge, not even testifying, that is astounding to me. He was right there in that room. He refuses to testify.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/local/2018/09/23/dana-rohrabacher-backs-brett-kavanaugh-left-pounces/,"Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) backed Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh last weekend ó and the left is outraged.Rohrabacher was secretly recorded ó against California law, which requires two-party consent for taped conversations ó as he spoke to supporters last Saturday, before the†Washington Post published Christine Blasey Fordís name and the details of her accusation last Sunday, which claims that Kavanaugh groped her at a party in high school more than 35 years ago.The tape was leaked to the liberal website Talking Points Memo, which summarized Rohrabacherís comments (at 9:54). The context was a discussion about how the government could use surveillance and ìhate speechî rules to restrict freedom.:ìGeorge Orwell, he was so incredibly insightful and could see whatís going to happen. But thatís the challenge youíre going to have. At least I didnít have to worry about that Ö †This guy whoís going to be our Supreme Court justice ó and he better be our Supreme Court judge ó heís a perfect candidate, and what do they say? ëWell, in high school you did this.í High school?

A recent†New York Times / Sienna College poll found that he was tied, 45%-45%, with Democrat challenger Harley Rouda.Talking Points Memo apparently tried to make the most out of the recording, publishing it after Dr. Fordís story had emerged. Several local news outlets picked up the story. However, the effect may have been the opposite of the one intended, as Fordís story has since been contradicted by every single potential witness she has named, including one of her own friends. A poll last week indicated that only 25 percent of American women believed that Dr. Fordís story about Kavanaugh is credible.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/22/gary-bauer-kavanaugh-confirmation-process-political-waterboarding-redux-of-clarence-thomas-hi-tech-lynching/,"Gary Bauer, conservative activist and former president of the Family Research Council (FRC), said on Friday that the politicization of the Supreme Court nominee confirmation process has been going on for decades but is reaching new levels today as the United States Senate considers Brett Kavanaugh for a seat on the high court.ìThis is a travesty,î Bauer said at the 2018 Values Voter Summit in Washington, D.C.† ìI cannot imagine what it has felt like for Judge Kavanaugh to be in that hearing room.îìItís almost like political waterboarding ó thatís what our political process has become,î Bauer said.Bauer, who has been in Washington for more than three decades and has witnessed the confirmation process for judges in four Republican administrations, provided a history lesson, beginning with President Ronald Reaganís nomination of Robert Bork, who was voted down because he was an atheist by a Senate that is tasked with preserving and protecting Americansí religious liberty.President George H.W. Bush nominated David Souter, who turned out not to be a conservative, but then Bush redeemed himself, Bauer said, when he nominated Clarence Thomas, in 1991, to replace Thurgood Marshall.Clarence Thomasís confirmation, like Kavanaughís, was thrown into chaos when, near the end of the process Anita Hill, ó a woman who had worked with Thomas at the United States Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) ó accused him of sexual harassment in a report leaked to the media.Thomas categorically denied he had ever spoken inappropriately to Hill or shared pornographic materials with her as she claimed.Bauer said he and other Thomas supporters formed the Citizens Committee to Confirm Clarence Thomas to fight against the Democrats and pro-abortion activists who opposed him, just like Kavanaughís opposition.But, Bauer said, rather than the loud and rude protesters at Kavanaughís recent hearing, supporters showed up to cheer Thomas on as he faced the Senate Democratsí scathing interrogation.ìFor Clarence Thomas ó with that being the last thing he saw ó walked into the hearing room, sat down at that chair and confronted those senators,î Bauer said.ìImagine this young man that had grown up in poverty, raised by a single mother, had overcome all kinds of problems to get to the level where he was,î Bauer said of Thomas. ìBut he had made one mistake in his life. He was a black American willing to defend conservative principles. And that is why they needed to stop him.îBauer read from Thomasís now iconic testimony, which came as something new to many of the young people at the summit.ìThis is not an opportunity to talk about difficult problems privately or in a closed environment,î Thomas said. ìThis is a circus.îìItís a national disgrace,î Thomas said. ìAnd from my standpoint as a black American, it is a high tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas.îìAnd it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order this is what will happen to you,î Thomas said. ìYou will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the U.S. Senate rather than hung from a tree.îìThatís what weíre going through now,î Bauer said. ìA circus.îìWhen the history books that matter are written, it will show that because of Clarence Thomasí fifth vote, time and time again, that this country is a better place than it would have been otherwise,î Bauer said.Fast forward to today and Christine Blasey Fordís 11th-hour claim that Kavanaugh groped her at a party 35 years ago when the two were in high school.But even if the similarities between the nominations of Thomas and Kavanaugh are striking, the outcome his opponents seek is more than destroying a manís reputation and ambitions.Thatís clear from what unfolded at Kavanaughís hearings, Bauer said, including the behavior of Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee. He cited Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) and their pandering to todayís radical left in the Democratic Party.ì[Booker] knows the current grassroots of the progressive Democrat movement in this country is demanding that people like Senator Booker break all the rules to resist the duly elected president and vice president of the United States and to overturn the election results where 63 million Americans voted for [President Donald Trump],î Bauer said.Bauer also chided Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the ranking member on the committee, who has had Fordís letter since July and did not bring up its existence at Kavanaughís hearings or in her private meeting with him.ìShe sat on that letter hoping, I suspect, that these other tactics they were using would be able to stop judge Kavanaugh,î Bauer said. ìAnd when it failed, then all of a sudden the letter becomes public and we are in the middle of this circus.îBauer said there is no proof yet that what Ford alleges is true, ëbut there is something we can prove, and thatís Kavanaughís character,î which he said is clear not only in his professional record but from the dozens and dozens of people who have spoken out on his behalf.Moreover, at the end of the day, Bauer said he believes another stellar conservative will be seated on the high court.ìAnd my friends in a few weeks, when Judge Kavanaugh is sworn in as the next Supreme Court justice, we will not just be celebrating that day, we will be celebrating for the next 30 years,î Bauer said.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

A grand jury has reportedly been impaneled in that case.Bromwich and his business partner Melissa Schwartz confirmed reports he had agreed to help Christine Blasey Ford on Twitter:Iím honored to be joining Debra Katz and Lisa Banks in representing Dr. Ford https://t.co/WdhWj0qmSwó Michael R. Bromwich (@mrbromwich) September 22, 2018Ford accuses Kavanaugh of having drunkenly groped her at a high school party when he was 17.Like Katz, a Democratic donor and left-wing activist, Bromwich has a long history of involvement in cases closely tied to the political ambitions of the Democratic Party. During the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s, he served as an Office of Independent Counsel prosecutor. He helped secure convictions of Reagan administration National Security Council staffer Lt. Col. Oliver North. Those convictions were all later reversed on appeal.In 2010, following the Deepwater Horizon disaster, President Barack Obama picked Bromwich to oversee efforts to overhaul offshore drilling regulations. His recommendations quickly came under fire from the energy industry for ìstiflingî production.In 2012, as the Fast and Furious scandal broke, Bromwich served as counsel to Jason Weinstein, a DOJ official he had originally hired in the 1990s who resigned from the department after Inspector General Michael Horowitzís report savaged him over his oversight of the ATFís ìFast and Furiousî gun-walking operation.Bromwich will join Fordís team shortly after Katz sent the Senate Judiciary Committee a letter in which she claims her client ìagreesî to testify. The text of that letter, however, quickly makes clear Katz has come to no agreement, having agreed neither to any of the dates offered by the committee or to any of the terms that were made clear in a letter addressed to Fordís legal team on Friday.As with all previous public communications on the matter, Katz demands further delays, which, at this point, stand the very real possibility of rendering Kavanaughís confirmation before the start of the Supreme Courtís October term impossible.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/09/22/hillary-clinton-stephen-colbert-fbi-must-investigate-brett-kavanaugh/,"Hillary Clinton told Stephen Colbert Friday that the FBI needs to investigate the sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.The two-time presidential loser appeared on the anti-Trump late-night show to publicize the paperback version of her book What Happened. Inevitably, the conversation turned to the 36-year-old allegations against the supreme court nominee.As of now, things are at a standstill. Kavanaughís accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, has missed numerous deadlines to agree to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, even as Republicans bend over backward to accommodate her demands ó some of which are being criticized as unreasonable. For example, Ford does not want Kavanaugh to have the chance to rebut her testimony, she does not want to be questioned by lawyers, and she refuses to fly in from California.Many see these as delaying tactics, as an attempt by Ford and her left-wing handlers to stretch out the process until after the election, which could kill Kavanaughís confirmation if Democrats take over the Senate.Another delaying tactic has been this call for an FBI investigation. Although the FBI does not investigate local crimes, Ford, Democrats, and now Hillary Clinton continue to push for the FBI to get involved in an alleged incident that happened in 1982 when Kavanaugh was still a minor ó 17-years-old.Whatís more, Ford says she cannot remember where or when it happened.For his part, Kavanaugh unambiguously denies the allegation and two witnesses back him up. Whatís more, unlike his accuser, Kavanaugh appears eager to testify to his innocence in public and under the penalty of perjury.On Friday, Hillary not only called for the FBI to get involved, she also accused Republicans, who are now in a second week of delay, of rushing things.Republicans are ìtrying to rush this through to the detriment of the American public who deserves to have answers to whatever charges might be presented,î she said.ìSo Iím hoping that at some point there will be an agreement to have an investigation,î she added. ìIt would be very easy for the FBI to go back and finish the background investigation, to investigate these charges.îThe FBI has already completed six background checks on Kavanaugh.ìAnd, you know, maybe find out thereís nothing to them, maybe find out thereís something to them, but at least have that investigation completed. And I think thatís what is a fair request, for due process to be asked for.îColbert also brought up Merrick Garland, who was President Obamaís Supreme Court nominee after the 2016 death of Antonin Scalia.ìDo you think the nomination process in general is irreparably damaged following the Republicans not allowing Merrick Garland to be heard?î Colbert asked.ìWell, itís one of the reasons I think a lot of Americans are just fed up with the political process,î Clinton answered, adding, ìBecause in a democracy, you have to have at least enough trust to be able to work with each other and try to solve difficult problems.îReferring directly to Garland, she said, ìWhen the Republicans refused to give a distinguished judge, appointed by President Obama, even the courtesy of meetings let alone a hearing, that sent such a terrible message.îWhat Clinton left out, though, is that Republicans refused to consider Garland because this Supreme Court opening occurred in the heat of the 2016 presidential election.The precedent for not going through a Supreme Court confirmation process during a presidential election year is nothing new. In fact, Barack Obamaís own vice president backed this precedent in 1992.There was no Supreme Court vacancy in 1992. When he made those remarks (linked above), Biden was getting ahead of that possibility. But had there been a vacancy in 1992, and had the vacancy been held until after the election, it would have been Hillary Clintonís husband, President Bill Clinton, who benefited from the precedent.Lost on no one, though, except the sycophantic Colbert, is the irony of having Hillary Clinton (of all people) seriously discuss the issue of sexual misconduct. For decades Hillary has been seen as her husbandís chief enabler, a man credibly accused of rape, who settled a sexual harassment suit as president, who engaged in a sleazy Oval Office sexual affair with a young subordinateÖThe left, including feminists, and the establishment media, never wanted the FBI to investigate any of this.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/22/chuck-grassley-gives-kavanaughs-accuser-more-time-missed-deadline/,"Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley granted†another extension to Christine Blasey Ford, the California psychology professor who recently brought forth a decades-old sexual misconduct allegation against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, in reply to her lawyerís latest counteroffer.Minutes prior to Grassleyís 10:00 p.m. deadline to respond, Debra Katz, an attorney for†Ford, sent a letter to the chairman, alleging†the time limitís ìsole purpose is to bully Dr. Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-altering implications for her and her familyî:NEW: Letter from Ford's lawyer to Grassley's staff blasts them for announcing Monday vote, asks her to ""be given an additional day to make her decision."" pic.twitter.com/cUAdmgyD6Xó Sam Stein (@samstein) September 22, 2018In a near-midnight tweet, the Iowa lawmaker wrote that if the professor does not wish to testify, ìsay so so we can move on,î adding, ìI want to hear ur testimony.îìFive times now we hv granted extension for Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w her desire stated one wk ago that she wants to tell senate her story Dr Ford if u changed ur mind say so so we can move on I want to hear ur testimony,î Grassley tweeted. ìCome to us or we to uî:Five times now we hv granted extension for Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w her desire stated one wk ago that she wants to tell senate her story  Dr Ford if u changed ur mind say so so we can move on I want to hear ur testimony.

The 53-year-old Californian now†claims†that in 1982, an inebriated Kavanaugh forced her into a room and groped her during a house party. Ford has stated she never mentioned the alleged incident to anyone until 2012, when she revealed it during a marriage counseling session with her husband.As Breitbart News reported, the Senate Judiciary chairman turned down Fordís request that only senators, not attorneys, be allowed to ask questions. Further, Grassley rejected her proposal that she testify after Kavanaugh, a position lawyers consider advantageous because it gives them a chance to rebut accusations.ìSome of your other demands, however, are unreasonable and we are unable to accommodate them. You demanded that Judge Kavanaugh be the first person to testify,î Grassley wrote in a statement. ìAccommodating this demand would be an affront to fundamental notions of due process.îGrassley said he would schedule a hearing for Wednesday, rather than Thursday, as Ford prefers.The Iowa lawmaker also rebuffed other Ford requests, including calling additional witnesses. Ford wants an appearance by Mark Judge, a Kavanaugh friend whom Ford asserts was at the high school party and in the bedroom where Kavanaughís assault occurred. Ford eventually escaped.Grassley consented to other Ford demands, including that she be provided security and that Kavanaugh not be in the hearing room when she testifies.Kavanaughís ascension to the Supreme Court seemed a sure bet until Ford emerged last weekend and provided details of the alleged assault. Kavanaugh, a District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals judge, has repeatedly denied the accusation.While rallying in support of†Republican†Missouri Senate candidate Josh Hawley, President Donald Trump†assured supporters that Kavanaughís confirmation is ìgoing to happen,î while reminding them of the importance of sticking by the Supreme Court nominee.ìI said, ëWe have to fight for him, not worry about the other side,íî President Trump said of Kavanaugh.During his remarks before the Values Voter Summit in Washington, DC, on Friday,†Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell drew a standing ovation when he assured a gathering of evangelical activists that the conservative Kavanaugh would soon be a justice. ìWeíre going to plow right through and do our jobs,î he said.Kavanaugh had seemed to gain momentum among Republican senators this week, with growing numbers saying it was approaching time to vote and those who had voiced concern about Fordís charges stopping short of expressing opposition to Kavanaugh. But with the slender 51-49 GOP majority and the unpredictability of how Ford and Kavanaugh would come across to millions of American voters should she agree to testify, his approval remains in question.The†Associated Press contributed to this report.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/sen-cory-booker-admitted-to-groping-female-friend-at-15/,"A†Star-Ledger†columnist has revisited a piece written by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, in which he admitted to ìgropingî a female friend at age 15.On Thursday, Paul Mulshine asked, ìGuess who wrote the followingî:New Yearís Eve 1984 I will never forget. I was 15. As the ball dropped, I leaned over to hug a friend and she met me instead with an overwhelming kiss. As we fumbled upon the bed, I remember debating my next ëmoveí as if it were a chess game. With the ìTop Gunî slogan ringing in my head, I slowly reached for her breast. After having my hand pushed away once, I reached my ìmark.îOur groping ended soon and while no ìrelationshipî ensued, a friendship did. You see, the next week in school she told me that she was drunk that night and didnít really know what she was doing.Mulshine had cited a portion of a piece†written in 1992 by ñ as he calls him ñ ìour junior U.S. Senator, Cory ëSpartacusí Booker,î when the senator was a student at Stanford University.The column, titled ìSo Much for Stealing Second,î was apparently written by Booker to highlight his conversion from a 15-year-old who was ìtrotting around the bases and stealing secondî to a ìsensitive manî who came to understand women as victims of menís sexual ìpower plays.îIn his piece, Booker proudly boasted that his transformation was so stark, one college friend even referred to him as a ìman-hater.îIn a second column,†cited by Fox News, in which Booker referred to ìdate rape,î he admitted, ìWith this issue as with so many others, a dash of sincere introspection has revealed to me a dangerous gap ó a gap between my beliefs and my actions.îBookerís writings have drawn criticism, as they have circulated once again, since he is considered to be a potential 2020 presidential contender.ìBut that column puts the senator in an awkward position regarding the allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by psychologist Christine Blasey Ford,î Mulshine pointed out as well.Now-Sen. Booker has called for a delay in the vote to confirm Kavanaugh, in light of Fordís accusation of sexual misconduct against the nominee ñ which Kavanaugh denies ñ over 35 years ago.ìIt takes enormous courage to come forward publicly as Ms. Ford has,î Booker said. ìThe Senate owes it to her and every survivor of sexual trauma to listen to her story and gather all of the facts before moving forward with this nomination.îThe New Jersey Democrat also said Fordís accusations against Kavanaugh are ìserious, credible, and deeply troubling,î and called for an FBI investigation into the allegations.ìBut based on that Stanford Daily column, Booker should be giving Kavanaugh the benefit of the doubt as well,î Mulshine asserted. ìThe point of it was that the future senator had ëa wake-up callí and decided ëI will never be the same.íîLeading Anti-Kavanaugh Senator Admitted Teen GropingÖ https://t.co/zUqD3lNNTPó DRUDGE REPORT (@DRUDGE_REPORT) September 20, 2018Fox News reported†that Bookerís office denied he is guilty of any hypocrisy, and painted the senator as a victim of a ìright-wing attack.îìThis disingenuous right-wing attack, which has circulated online and in partisan outlets for the past five years, rings hollow to anyone who reads the entirety of Senator Bookerís Stanford Daily column,î Bookerís spokesperson said in a statement.ìThe column is in fact a direct criticism of a culture that encourages young men to take advantage of women ñ written at a time when so candidly discussing these issues was rare ñ and speaks to the impact Senator Bookerís experience working to help rape and sexual assault survivors as a college peer counselor had on him,î the spokesperson added.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/trump-get-out-and-vote-in-the-midterms-because-youre-voting-for-me-in-2018/,"President Trump delivered a rousing appeal to his supporters to get-out-the-vote for Republican candidates at a rally in Springfield, Missouri on Friday night in support of Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, the GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate seat on the ballot this November.The president also strongly supported Judge Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee to serve on the Supreme Court.ìWe have to fight for him, not worry about the other side,î the president said†he told a Republican senator in Washington of Kavanaugh.He also aggressively attacked the platform of the Democrat party.ìThe new platform of the Democrat party is radical socialism and open borders. A vote for any Democrat this November is a vote for massive regulation, massive taxes, and massive crime,î Trump told the large and enthusiastic crowd.ìThe Democrat party is held hostage by angry mobs, ëDeep Stateí radicals and their establishment cronies,î the president continued.ìWeíre going to be fighting [in 2018] to keep what we have,î he added.ìYou canít be complacentî he told the crowd about the 2018 midterm elections.ìGet out in 2018, because youíre voting for me in 2018,î the president said.The current Real Clear Politics Average of Polls shows Hawley and incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) are statistically tied in a state the president won by 19 percent in 2016.With 46 days until the election, absentee ballot voting (both by mail and in-person) begins in Missouri just four days from Friday, and the stakes in the race could not be higher. Republicans hold a slender 51 to 49 majority in the Senate, and, though the electoral map does not favor Democrats this cycle, they could regain a majority in the upper chamber of Congress with a net pick-up of two seats.Missouri is one of many states where incumbent Democrat senators must hold on in order for the party to accomplish that two-seat net gain. Some optimistic Democrats are eyeing Arizona and Tennessee, which the Cook Political Report currently rate as ìtoss-ups,î as potential Democrat Senate seat flips.The enthused and energetic crowd cheered throughout the entire rendition of Lee Greenwoodís ìGod Bless the USAî as Trump entered the hall.As President Trump stepped to the podium, the crowd broke into chants of ìUSA! USA! USA!îTrump immediately blasted McCaskill and praised Hawley, her Republican opponent.ìMcCaskill voted for the liberal Obama judges who want to destroy your 2nd amendment. They want to destroy your health care, they want to destroy your wealth. They all as a group, they want to raise the hell out of your taxes,î he added.ìShe reveals her true colors when she pretended to tour the state in an RV when she was actually flying around the state in her luxurious private airplane,î Trump said of McCaskill.ìMcCaskill doesnít represent the people of Missouri, she represents the radical Democrats in Washington, D.C. who are trying to take over. Ö Claire McCaskill voted no on tax cuts. And thatís tax cuts for the middle class families,î the president pointed out.Trump continued to run down a long list of bad votes by McCaskill.ìMcCaskill voted no on Kateís Law. How do you vote no on Kateís Law? You know why?† Because Schumer and Pelosi told her,î the president said.ìAnd she voted no on enhanced vetting for refugees. She wants to let everybody pour into our country. She wants to give them free health care Ö McCaskill voted no on our new Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsich. How good is he?î the president asked rhetorically.ìWe need Josh. Ö We have to fight for him,î Trump said of Hawley.ìPlease welcome a special man, a special talent Ö the next United State Senator from Missouri, Josh Hawley,î the president said as he introduced Hawley.ìHow about the leadership of President Donald J. Trump?î Hawley asked, as the crowd responded with loud cheers.ìWe had to turn away about 20,000 people who couldnít get into the stadium,î Hawley told the audience.Other press reports indicated the line to get into the 11,000 capacity stadium extended for as long as two miles.ìHave you noticed something about our president? When he makes a promise he keeps it. When he makes a commitment he delivers. Heís delivering big for the state of Missouri and the United States of America,î Hawley said.The GOP candidate for Senate then turned his attention to the current confirmation battle for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.ìThe president said heís going to put pro-Constitution judges on the bench and he has. Judges who love the Constitution. Judges who love our country. Judges like Brett Kavanaugh,î Hawley said.ìThereís somebody in the state of Missouri who hasnít heard what youíve been telling her. Thereís somebody who hasnít been willing to work with the president. That somebody is Claire McCaskill,î he added.ìShe said sheís going to vote no on Judge Kavanaugh,î Hawley said.ìIím not sure who sheís with, but sheís not with the state of Missouri. Ö This November in this state, letís make history again, letís make America great again,î he concluded, turning the podium back to the president.ìJosh is a star. Heís one hundred percent pro 2nd amendment. We need Josh in the Senate to fight for Missouri,î the president said of Hawley.ìWeíll never ever get a vote from Claire McCaskill,î Mr. Trump said, pointing to her promised no vote on Kavanaugh as the most recent example.The president ended the hour and fifteen minutes rally with another push to get out the Republican vote.ìFor years you watched as your leaders apologized for America. Now you have a president who will never apologize for America, but only will stand up for America,î Trump said, adding:We are standing up for your values we standing up for Missouri, and we are standing up for our national anthem.To continue this momentum, to protect your family your jobs and country . . .You need to get out and vote Republican, and vote for Josh Hawley.ìWe are going to win,win, win,î the president said, adding:We will win for our familiesWe will win for our freedomsWe will win for our great American flagWe will not bend we will not break. . .We will always fight on to victory.Our hearts truly bleed red white and blue.We are one people one family and one glorious nation under GodìGo vote for Josh!î were the presidentís closing words as the event ended.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/kavanaugh-accusers-lawyers-refuse-to-meet-grassleys-final-deadline/,"UPDATE: Approximately 90 minutes after the expiration of the 10:00 p.m. deadline, Chairman Grassley took to Twitter, where he made clear that, despite his repeated extensions, he is offering yet another extension to Christine Blasey Fordís legal team, presumably until Saturday, for her to decide whether to testify, in line with attorney Deborah Katzís demands:Five times now we hv granted extension for Dr Ford to decide if she wants to proceed w her desire stated one wk ago that she wants to tell senate her story  Dr Ford if u changed ur mind say so so we can move on I want to hear ur testimony.

That 10:00 p.m. Eastern deadline was imposed after Grassleyís relenting from a 10:00 a.m. deadline to let the Judiciary Committee know if Ford would be testifying under oath on Monday. A new date of Wednesday was offered, with an initial deadline to accept of 5:00 p.m., but after rejecting a series of Fordís lawyers controversial demands, a final extension of five hours was offered.Among these demands were a Thursday or later hearing date and a prohibition on the Senate Judiciary Committee enlisting female outside lawyers to assist them in taking Fordís testimony. Most controversially, Fordís legal team demanded that Ford, the accuser, testify after the accused, Kavanaugh. In their final offer letter, Republican Judiciary Committee staff called this demand in a particular ìan affront to fundamental notions of due process.îIf Grassley and his fellow Republicans on the Judiciary Committee stick to their announced plan, the committee will convene for a vote Monday. If, as expected, the Republican majority votes to approve Kavanaughís confirmation, it will pass to the full Senate, where a vote for cloture, setting up a final full-Senate vote, can be taken Wednesday morning. That final vote could then be taken Thursday, allowing Kavanaugh to take a seat on the Supreme Court in time of the start of the Courtís October term.In her Friday night email, Katz insists that ìthe 10 p.m deadline is arbitrary. Its sole purpose is to bully Dr. Ford and deprive her of the ability to make a considered decision that has life-altering implications for her and her family.îTiming in the case, however, has serious implications for Kavanaughís confirmation. Without a hearing Monday, or at the very latest Wednesday, as Grassley had offered, confirming Kavanaugh before the start of the Supreme Courtís new term becomes virtually impossible.

Ted Cruz (R-TX) said Friday evening during a highly-anticipated debate against his Democrat Senate opponent†Rep. Beto OíRourke (D-TX)†in Dallas, TX, that the progressive congressman†ó akin to Hillary Clinton†ó supports the appointment of Supreme Court Justices that would ìeffectively write the†Second†Amendment out of the Constitution.î(Watch: 16:07 ñ 18:07)A partial transcript is as follows:†DEBATE MODERATOR: And weíre moving on here, the next question [is] for Senator Cruz. Details are still being worked out, but Dr. Chrstine Blasley Ford may testify about her allegations of attempted sexual assault†against Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Is there anything you could hear from here that would make you change your vote.SEN. TED CRUZ: Well, absolutely. Listen, I very much hope Dr. Ford comes next week and testifies before the Judiciary†Committee. I publically called for her to be given an opportunity to testify and I urged my colleagues. The allegations sheís raised are serious and they deserve to be treated with respect. I hope that she comes. As a full opportunity to tell her story in a way that is respectful, but I also think Judge Kavanaugh deserves a full opportunity to defend himself and to let the American people listen and come to an assessment†of what happened. We donít know right now. We need to give them a full hearing. I will say more broadly than this, this issue, whether it is Judge Kavanaugh, whether it is Neil Gorsuch, whether it is other Supreme Court nominees, reflects one of the many massive divides on policy, substance, and record between me and Congressman OíRourke.†Congressman OíRourke doesnít want Judge Kavanaugh confirmed. He said that before these allegations, he said that after these allegations. He didnít want Neil Gorsuch confirmed.Congressman OíRourke agrees with Hillary Clinton. He wants liberal judiciary activists on the court, who will impose their particular policy. I have devoted virtually my entire life to defend the Constitution and Bill of Rights. I think one of the major issues the American people had before us in 2016 was ëwhat vision of the court you want?í I believe Texans want Constitutions on the Supreme Court, who will defend the First Amendment, who will defend free speech, who will defend religious liberty. religious liberty, one of the fundamental†liberties, has been under assault. Who will defend the†Second†Amendment, and I would note that the Justices Congressman OíRourke would insist upon, like Hillary Clinton, are Justices that would undermine and effectively write the†Second†Amendment out of the Constitution. Those are radical views and theyíre not views consistent†with the overwhelming†majority of Texans.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/grassley-sends-final-deadline-for-kavanaugh-accusers-lawyers-10-p-m-friday/,"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) set what he says is the final deadline Friday for Judge Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Fordís lawyers to agree to have her testify at a hearing next week.If Fordís attorneys do not reach an agreement to one of the several options they have been offered for their client to tell her side of the story, Grassley will schedule a committee vote on Kavanaugh for Monday.ìDespite the fact that the July 30th letter remains hidden, my committee has been investigating the allegations and has heard from multiple witnesses since Sunday,î†Grassley said in a statement to reporters after Fordís attorneys, led by Democratic activist Deborah Katz, failed to respond first to a 10:00 a.m. deadline to agree to testify Monday and then a concession offer of 5:00 p.m. to testify Wednesday.The statement continues:Ms. Katz has discussed Dr. Fordís allegations in numerous media interviews and said on TV Monday morning that Dr. Ford wants to share her account with the Senate Judiciary Committee. Itís Friday night and nothingís been agreed to despite our extensive efforts to make testimony possible. Iím extending the deadline for response yet again to 10 oíclock this evening. Iím providing a notice of a vote to occur Monday in the event that Dr. Fordís attorneys donít respond or Dr. Ford decides not to testify. In the event that we can come to a reasonable resolution as Iíve been seeking all week, then I will postpone the committee vote to accommodate her testimony. We cannot continue to delay.Grassleyís move represents the firmest language yet that Senate Republicans have reached the end of their patience since Fordís allegation that Kavanaugh had groped her at a high school party more than 35 years ago threw the confirmation process into disarray last weekend. Grassley set a full public hearing under oath, only for Fordís lawyers to repeatedly not agree to have their client testify.In the intervening time, those lawyers have reportedly issued a fluid set of demands including excluding outside counsel from asking any questions at the hearing, having Ford not be required to appear in the same room as Kavanaugh, testifying in the opposite order of an actual trial with the accuser having the last word and the accused, Kavanaugh, having no opportunity to reply, and finally, Friday, claiming a further delay was needed because Ford was unwilling to board a plane for fear of confined spaces.The Judiciary Committee also released the text of the previous offer, originally made with 5 p.m. deadline, that was put to Fordís lawyers after they failed to meet the 10 a.m. deadline for the Monday hearing. ìThe Chairman has offered the ability for Dr. Ford to testify in an open session, a closed session, a public staff interview, and a private staff interview,î the offer letter explains. ìThe Chairman is even willing to fly female staff investigators to meet Dr. Ford and you in California, or anywhere else, to obtain Dr. Fordís testimony.îThe letter goes on to refuse some of Fordís lawyersí most controversial demands:Some of your other demands, however, are unreasonable and we are unable to accommodate them. You demanded that Judge Kavanaugh be the first person to testify. Accommodating this demand would be an affront to fundamental notions of due process.ÖYou also demanded that only senators be permitted to ask questions of the witnesses. We are also unable to accommodate this demand. There is no rule of the Senate or the Committee that precludes staff attorneys from asking witnesses questions. We reserve the option to have female staff attorneys, who are sensitive to the particulars of Dr. Fordís allegations and are experienced investigators, question both witnesses.ÖYou demanded that the Committee issue subpoenas for the testimony of Mark Judge and other unidentified witnesses. The Committee is unable to accommodate this demand. The Committee does not take subpoena requests from witnesses as a condition of their testimony.ÖYou demanded that the Committee call additional witnesses that Dr. Ford requests. We are unable to accommodate this demand. The Committee does not take witness requests from other witnesses.The Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, led by Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who withheld a letter detailing Fordís account of her alleged sexual assault for more than six weeks, meanwhile issued a response admonishing Republicans for their handling of the situation. ì[W]e are disheartened to see many of our colleagues in the majority have already made up their minds and begun to dismiss and diminish Dr. Fordís experience,î the Democrats letter reads. ìUp to this point, the Committee majorityís treatment of Dr. Ford has unquestionably been worse than the disgraceful treatment that Anita Hill received 27 years ago.†We are better than this.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/21/steve-schmidt-kavanaugh-is-a-lose-lose-for-gop-there-is-a-blue-tsunami-coming/,"Friday on MSNBCís ìDeadline,î former campaign strategist for George W. Bush and the late John McCainís 2008 fail presidential campaign Steve Schmidt said in the midterm elections, Republican lawmakers were in a ìlose-loseî situation concerning President Donald Trumpís nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh.Schmidt said ìTheyíre in a lose-lose situation now. You would see a demoralized base. It would be a major defeat for the president. He will be seen to have backed down. The base will be angry. It will be enraged at Republican Senators who they think will have betrayed the president. But also if they force it through and Kavanaugh is confirmed, it will intensify passions on the Democratic side. It will drive women turnout in this election in 2018, and I think that whatever the size of the blue tsunami thatís comingóand I think there is one comingóI think itís going to grow. I think it could be the difference, for example, between Beto OíRourke narrowly being defeated by Ted Cruz and Beto OíRourke narrowly winning that race.îHe added, ìBut there will be a profound political implication no matter what. This is a terrible circumstance. Let me just say that I think that itís going to be impossible to find out what happened in that room between teenagers 36 years ago, but itís not impossible to find out in the moment if someoneís lying about memories of where they were and when it happened and specifically if there is any knowledge by Judge Kavanaugh about the Ed Whelan conspiracy theory where a middle school teacher was smeared and publicly identified as the person who possibly did that. If that was a coordinated strategyóand Iím not suggesting for a second that Brett Kavanaugh had any knowledge about itóI say this as someone who ran two of these, the nominees donít have much say in the political strategy around themóbut if he knew, then I think that disqualifies him, and it has to go down. At the end of the day, this is Collins and Murkowski who are the two senators that are going to determine whether he sits on the court or whether he doesnít.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

And they can do it without convicting Kavanaugh of whatís been accused, but by just saying thereís too many questions. I think that the president might have tilted it in a way that he really will regret.îI have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/09/21/alan-dershowitz-absurd-and-outrageous-to-make-kavanaugh-testify-before-ford/,"Harvard Law School Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz described demands for Judge Brett Kavanaugh to testify before Christine Ford as ìabsurd,î ìoutrageous,î and ìinconceivable.î†He offered his remarks in a Friday interview on SiriusXMís Breitbart News Daily with Breitbart News Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow.Ford, a California professor, accused Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh of a ìrape attemptî when both were high schoolers in the 1980s.Dershowitz said, ìItís obvious what should happen. [Christine Ford] should testify first, make the accusation, lay it out, and then [Brett Kavanaugh] should be asked to respond.îLISTEN:Dershowitz added, ìCivil liberties have to be complied with, and the ACLU, we donít hear from them. When the accuserís lawyer says that the accused has to go first, thatís such a fundamental denial of due process, the way they used to do it in the Star Chamber, you call somebody in, have him deny everything, and then you bring in the accuser afterward. Thatís just not the way the Anglo-American system of justice has ever worked.îDershwoitz continued, ìIt would be outrageous to have him testify first and her testify only in response, and I want to hear from the American Civil Liberties Union on that issue. For years and years theyíve talked about due process of law and due process canít apply only to Democrats and not to Republicans.îDershowitz explained the centrality of an accusedís right to respond to his or her accuser.ìWhatís not reasonable, at all, and what really destroyed the credibility of some of the other reasonable claims, is this demand that he go first,î said Dershowitz. ìItís just impossible to imagine a legal system that is anything consistent with the rule of law which puts the accused on the stand first before the accuser takes the stand. Itís just inconceivable that that should happen.îDershowitz criticized assumptive descriptions of Ford as a ìvictimî and ìsurvivor,î as well as descriptions of Kavanaugh as a ìperpetrator.îìWhat you have is media on the left calling her a victim and calling her a survivor, we donít know if thatís true,î noted Dershowitz. ìIt may very well be true, and calling him a perpetrator, and we donít know whether thatís true. The presumption of innocence has to still apply.îBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.

How many of you believe Judge Kavanaugh when he says this didnít happen?î CNN reporter Randi Kaye asked a group of women.All of the women answered that they believed him.ìBecause one woman made an allegationñsorry, I donít buy it,î a woman named†Lourdes Castillo de la Pena said in part.ìIn the grand scheme of things, my goodness, there was no intercourse. There was maybe a touch. Can weñreally? 36 years later? Sheís still stuck on that? Had it happened,î Irina Villarino said.ìI mean, weíre talking about a 15-year-old girl, which I respect.

Sheís gotten death threats. So if sheís lying, why come forward?î CNNís Kaye asked.ìSheís also destroying his life, his wifeís life, his childrenís lives. His career. I mean, why didnít she come out sooner if sheís telling the truth?î†Villarino answered.ìWhy didnít she come out when he was going into the Bush White House? Why didnít she come outñheís been a federal judge for over a decade,î Angie Vazquez wondered.Kaye compared the allegations against Kavanaugh to allegations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas.ìThis is not the same. This is a high school kid. I mean, itís not Anita Hillís story,î Lourdes Castillo de la Pena said.ìAs women, though, do you have some sympathy for her for what sheís going through?î CNNís Kaye also asked.ìNo, I have no sympathy. And perhaps maybe at that moment she liked him, and maybe he didnít pay attention to her afterward, and he went out with another girl, and she got bitter or whatever the situation is. Theyíre kids.î Castillo de la Pena answered.ìIf it is true, would it be okay with you if he became a justice on the Supreme Court?î Kaye finally asked.ìAs long as thatís an isolated incident, yes,î Lourdes Castillo de la Pena answered.ìHe was 17. He was not even an adult, and we all make mistakes at 17. I believe in a second chanceî Sosa said.ìIíd be more than okay with him being Supreme Court judge,î Villarino said.ìIf the person made a mistake and they move on, and they have been a good human being, you know, who are we to judge?î Castillo de la Pena added.Follow Justin Caruso on Twitter†@justincaruso2

For me, this is not political. Ö My being here has nothing to do with politics,î Fitzgerald said as she stood on stage with the other Kavanaugh-supporting women at Washington, DCís, JW Marriott hotel. ìIím here because I felt it important to share my perspective on Brettís character and to talk about a man that I have known for over 35 years.îLike the other speakers, Fitzgerald was offering her experience with Kavanaugh in light of California professor Christine Blasey Fordís allegation that more 35 years ago, a teenage Kavanaugh assaulted and groped her at a high school party. The allegation, withheld during Kavanaughís extensive confirmation hearings, has thrown his confirmation process into turmoil and jeopardized his ability to take a seat on the Supreme Court before the October 1 start of the Courtís new term.ìThe allegation against Brett is inconsistent with everything that I have known about him as a person,î Fitzgerald said. ìIn both public and private, Brett treated me and everyone I know with respect. He has always been kind and good-natured. He has always been caring and concerned with the well-being of others.îFitzgerald recounted how Kavanaugh had written her a note offering support when her friend was in a coma after a car wreck. ìThat was very typical of Brett, openly and unabashedly delivering care and compassion,î she said. ìTo my recollection, he was the only friend, male or female, who wrote a note to me after that terrible time.îFitzgerald also recalled Kavanaugh as gracious guest at her parentsí vacation home when they were growing up. ìIt was a full house, but Brett was always welcome. He was polite and considerate to my siblings and to the parents,î she told the audience.ìBrett was the kind of you wanted to take home to meet your parents. Brett was then, and still is, a stand up guy,î Fitzgerald concluded, yielding the podium to the next of the six women who spoke to offer her story of knowing Judge Kavanaugh.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/feminists-kavanaugh-ford-dont-need-prove-beyond-reasonable-doubt/,"Assorted heads of feminist organizations described Christine Blasey Ford as a ìsurvivorî of sexual assault ó accepting Fordís allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh prima facie ó during a Thursday conference hosted by the Feminist Majority Foundation†in Washington, DC.The word ìsurvivorî was used 32 times by the conferenceís featured speakers, according to C-SPANís automated transcription of the event. ìTraumaî was said 23 times.Roger Canaff, a former assistant district attorney in New York City, said a ìreasonable doubt standardî is not needed to block the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court:Weíre not dealing with a reasonable doubt standard, either. Thatís really important. We donít need to demonstrate this beyond a reasonable doubt. Judge Kavanaugh is not on trial. This is about whether or not he should have the privilege of serving in the highest court in the United States.Canaff also said Americans must ìstart by believingî all women who make allegations of sexual assault against men:Another thing that we believe in violence against women is to, what we call, ìstart by believingî: SBB. That doesnít mean that we continue to believe despite any fact that might emerge. Ö When we begin by believing survivors, then we allow them to open up their minds. We allow their anxiety to go down, their self-esteem to go up. More facts come forward, we actually reduce bias, and weíre able to get to the truth a lot faster.Indira Henard, executive director of the DC Rape Crisis Center, said Americans must ìbelieveî Fordís accusations against Kavanaugh:It is not our job to dissect Dr. Fordís story or any survivorís story of sexual violence. It is our job to believe them. It is our job to support them. It is our job to hold those responsible accountable. The burden of proof should not be on survivors of sexual violence. Dr. Ford should not be on trial. What we are seeing in the treatment of Dr. Ford is a travesty.Henard warned against senators ìperpetrating another level of violenceî against Ford in the event of Fordís testimony before a Senate committee:If [Christine Blasey Ford] shows up on Monday Ö [senators] are going to be perpetrating another level of violence because itís not going to be a trauma-informed process.We have to be very careful that our institutions are not reperpetrating violence which will be retraumatizing for survivors of sexual violence. Dr. Ford is not just standing as one; she is standing for ten thousand. What is happening to her is also happening to other survivors of sexual violence.Lisalyn Jacobs, an attorney, described Fordís claims as ìserious and credible charges of sexual violence.î She added that ìtime has vindicated [Anita Hill].î She continued:[Ford] is not on trial. Justice demands that we respect that Dr. Ford is a survivor of trauma and that the Senate Judiciary Committee hear from experts on the lasting impact of trauma on survivors. Justice demands that the hearing process be paused while the FBI reopens its investigation.Kiersten Stewart, a director at Futures Without Violence, called on Americaís men to ìbelieve womenî:To the men controlling this process: This is your test, as well. Do you respect women, or donít you? If you do, as you say, then you need to show it with your actions, now, when it matters.ÖTo the men out there: Now is your moment to take a stand. You know sexual violence is wrong. Most of you would never do it and hate is as much as we do. Speak out. Believe women. Use your power. Use your voice. Speak up for a fair process.Toni Van Pelt, president of National Organization for Women (NOW), noted the race and sex of Republican senators on the Senate Judiciary Committee:Only Chuck Grassley and Orrin Hatch still remain on the Senate Judiciary Committee that unfairly interrogated Anita Hill with malice and spitefulness. Today, all 11 white men on the Republican side of the dais seem intent on creating their own Anita Hill with Dr. Ford their new target.NOW calls on the Judiciary Committee to delay these hearings and to open them to witnesses who may wish to confirm Dr. Fordís account. Ö Dr. Ford made a brave decision to come forward.ìClearly, she is not lying,î added Pelt in reference to Ford.Some women attending the events held signs with the following messages: ì#CancelKavanaugh,î ìI stand with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford,î and ì#IBelieveChristine.îFollow Robert Kraychik on†Twitter.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/christine-blasey-ford-wants-thursday-hearing-to-stop-brett-kavanaugh-from-joining-supreme-court-oct-1/,"Christine Blasey Ford, the California psychology professor who has emerged to accuse Judge Brett Kavanaugh of groping her in high school over 35 years ago, wants to move Mondayís scheduled hearing to Thursday instead, among other demands.There is only one possible reason that Dr. Ford and her attorneys could want a Thursday hearing ó not Wednesday, as the GOP has now counter-offered, or Monday as originally scheduled: a Thursday hearing could preclude Kavanaugh from joining the Court for its new session on Oct. 1. (Dr. Ford has until Friday to respond to the counter-offer.)Here is why. The earliest that the Senate Judiciary Committee could vote for Judge Kavanaughís nomination to be considered by the full Senate would be Wednesday afternoon, if the hearing takes place. That would likely mean the earliest that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) could introduce a motion to confirm Kavanaugh would be Thursday morning. The Senate would then have 24 hours before a cloture motion Friday morning. Then there would be 30 hours of debate, meaning that the earliest that the Senate could vote to confirm Kavanaugh would be Saturday afternoon or evening ó September 29.But if the hearing were Thursday, the earliest the full Senate could vote would be Sunday evening, Sep. 30, with just hours to spare.That would create the very risk that a vote might not be held before Oct. 1, if procedural roadblocks arose (and they would). And some wavering Republicans might be uncomfortable voting to confirm a Supreme Court justice in the dead of night.The only possible reason for Dr. Ford to demand a Thursday hearing (as opposed to Wednesday/Tuesday or the scheduled Monday) is to prevent the Senate from voting to confirm Brett Kavanaugh before month's end, leaving him off the bench when the Supreme Court's next session starts.ó Joel B. Pollak (@joelpollak) September 21, 2018Theoretically, Kavanaugh could join the Court after Oct. 1. But once the Court began its fall session, the Democrats could argue that there is no rush to confirm him, that there should be more investigations, and that the president should let voters decide in November. That would turn the midterm elections into a referendum on the Court, and potentially create a huge political opportunity for Democrats ó and a problem for McConnell and the GOP, who promised a confirmation on time. Republican moderates could start to waver, effectively defeating the nomination ó and infuriating the conservative base.That is why Thursday is so important to Democrats. It also looks less suspicious than demanding a hearing on Friday, or demanding Republicans postpone the process for weeks or more.There is little doubt Ford is coordinating with Democrats. On Thursday, Republicans released the audio of a conference call held by the liberal American Constitutional Society in July with Democratic strategist Ricki Seidman, who is now one of Fordís advisers. In it, she laid out a strategy to defeat the nomination (3:19 to 3:33): ìI do think that over the coming days and weeks there will be a strategy that will emerge, and I think itís possible that that strategy might ultimately defeat the nominee.îFordís accusations ó which were known to ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) ó have become the ìstrategy that will emerge,î and demanding a Thursday hearing ó not Wednesday, or Monday ó is the way to bring it to fruition.Joel B.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/21/kavanaugh-friend-heartbroken-over-way-his-precious-family-has-been-treated/,"Laura Cox Kaplan joined more than 75 other women Friday at the #IStandWithBrett press conference and expressed her outrage over how close friend†Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his family have been treated after Christine Blasey Fordís allegation.ìThe nomination process should be one that weeds out those who are not qualified or suited to serve,î†Kaplan, who like Kavanaugh served in the George W. Bush administration, said from the podium at Washington, DCís JW Marriott hotel. ìSadly, this process isnít. It seems anyone can lodge an allegation, without corroboration or evidence, and dismantle a personís career, and their life, and the lives of their family members. This is wrong.îìMy husband Joel and I have been friends with Brett and Ashley Kavanaugh from the early days of the George W. Bush administration and well before the four of us were married,î Kaplan explained. ìFor more than 15 years, weíve shared lifeís victories and its heartaches, its highs and lows.îìThere are no two people who are more humble, more honorable, more generous, or more gracious and, in Brettís case, more qualified, to serve this country in the role for which he has been nominated,î Kaplan said, recounting stories of shared childrenís birthday parties and holidays between their two families.Kaplan focused on the pressures put on Kavanaughís family who, after intense left-wing media scrutiny, have received threats since Fordís accusation about a high school party in the early 1980s when Kavanaugh was 17 emerged after the close of regular confirmation hearings. She told the audience:While Brett is the person whoís been nominated, his family is going through this process too. My friend Ashley, and her precious girls, Margaret and Liza, who I love. I am heartbroken over the way that this precious family has been treated. What saddens me the most is that I know this person, Brett Kavanaugh, to be a person of the highest moral character and integrity ó someone who is humble, who puts others before himself, and someone who is beyond well-qualified for the position of the U.S. Supreme Court.The #IStandWithBrett conference was put on to bring together more than 75 women who have known Brett Kavanaugh for years or decades and stand by him. Some of the women have known Kavanaugh since the high school days where he is alleged, without corroborating evidence, to have drunkenly groped Ford at a small party. Kaplan was one of six who spoke.ìIt would have been a lot easier not to come here today. This is not particularly fun,î Kaplan said. ìBut it wouldnít have been right. And it wouldnít have been what Brett would have done.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/brett-kavanaugh-accusers-attorney-cancels-fundraiser-democrat-senator/,"A fundraiser for Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) slated for October at the office of Katz, Marshall & Banks, LLP ó the firm where Debra Katz, attorney for Brett Kavanaughís accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, is a partner ó was canceled once news of the partisan event surfaced.Katz and attorney Lisa Banks were listed as headliners for the ìcocktails and conversationî event to raise money for Baldwinís 2018 re-election bid, according to an invitation†obtained by CNN.Invitees were asked to pay $1,000 to attend the October 1 event at the Washington, DC, law firm, CNN reported:After CNN contacted the Baldwin campaign and the attorneys, Katz called CNN to say that the event was being canceled. The invite was sent Thursday morning, but a campaign spokesman called it an ìold inviteî scheduled before Fordís accusation became public.ìThe short answer is this: We did a fundraiser for Sen. Baldwin six years ago when we ran for the Senate, we supported her then,î Katz told CNN. ìWe are not going to be doing a fundraiser now. Weíre going to be focused on the issues involving the Kavanaugh confirmation process.îIn the eleventh hour of Brett Kavanaughís confirmation process to be seated on the United States Supreme Court ó days after long hearings and days before a scheduled Senate Judiciary Committee vote ó Ford accused the federal judge of groping her at a party while the two were in high school.Since making the allegation, Republicans in charge of the committee have scrambled to offer Ford the opportunity to testify on Monday and gave her several options for an interview venue with the committee or committee staff in D.C. or even in her home state of California.Initially, Katz said Ford would not testify until after the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) had completed a probe into her claim ó even after the agency said it would not conduct an investigation.Now Katz has said her client would be willing to come before the committee but not on Monday.Republicans still hope to have Kavanaugh confirmed before the high court begins its next session on October 1.A Baldwin campaign spokesman confirmed the event was canceled, according to CNN.ìThe event was scheduled before Dr. Ford made the allegations,î the spokesman said. ìDr. Fordís lawyers are no longer involved in the event.îFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/21/former-colleague-recounts-brett-kavanaugh-caring-for-her-on-9-11-was-a-gift/,"Sara Fagen, a friend and former colleague of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, recounted Friday how the future Judge offered her moral support moments following the†terror attacks of†September 11, 2001.Speaking before the ì#IStandWithBrettî press conference in Washington, DC, Fagen, a George W. Bush White House political director, said of Kavanaugh, ìOur friendship was forged on 9/11, the fateful day when many of my colleagues and I hastily†left the White House after being told by a Secret Service agent to run as fast as we could. Within seconds, I was in a sea of strangers walking up 17th Street†ó scared and alone†ó with nothing in my pocket.îFagen continued, ìI looked up, and there was Brett Kavanaugh. My colleague took care of me that day. He made sure I was safe, had food and money, and also made sure I got home safely that evening. The days after 9/11 in the White House were long and stressful, but Brett took the time to follow up with me and ensure I was doing okay. For me, running into Brett Kavanaugh that day was a gift.îThe conference, attended by around 75 women, took place as the Supreme Court nominee faces a 36-year-old sexual misconduct allegation leveled by California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford. The accuser alleges Kavanaugh and a friend shoved her into a room and groped her during a Maryland house party in 1982 or thereabout.Mike Judge, who the professor†alleges was in the room with her and Kavanaugh told the Weekly Standard that the claim was ìabsolutely nuts.îIn a statement Monday, Kavanaugh†denied†the claim, describing the decades-old allegation as ìcompletely false.îìI have never done anything like what the accuser describesóto her or to anyone,î the judge wrote. ìBecause this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. îSpeaking with reporters earlier in the week, President Donald Trump†defended†his Supreme Court pick, describing Kavanaugh as an ìoutstanding man,î and encouraged Ford to meet with the Senate Judiciary†Committee.ìLook, if she shows up and makes a credible showing, that will be very interesting and weíll have to make a decision,î President Trump said. ìBut I can only say this: heís such an outstanding man ó very hard for me to imagine that anything happened.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/21/timeline-democrats-changing-demands-for-christine-blasey-fords-testimony/,"The timeline of events following Christine Blasey Fordís decision to go public with her allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh can be characterized as a series of solicitous accommodations on the part of the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chairman, followed by shifting demands and stonewalling from Democrats and Fordís lawyers.The letters, statements, and public comments from Senate Republicans and the White House make clear their eagerness for Ford to come forward and be heard before the Senate Judiciary Committee, either in private or in public. At first, Democrats demanded that the accuser be heard. But once Republicans agreed, the goalposts moved, and moved, and moved ó always in the direction of delaying the confirmation vote.The following is a timeline of events.(Editorís†Note: scroll down for the latest updates.)Summer 2018: Christine Blasey Ford, a professor of clinical psychology at Palo Alto University, contacted the Washington Postís tip line after learning that Judge Brett Kavanaugh was on President Trumpís shortlist to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Washington Post reported.The Post also reported that around that same time, Ford contacted Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (D-CA), her representative in Congress.Monday, July 9, 2018: Trump officially nominated Kavanaugh to serve as retiring Justice Kennedyís replacement on the Supreme Court.Late July 2018: According to the Washington Post, in late July, Ford sent a letter through Rep. Eschooís office to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. In the letter, Ford requested anonymity and alleged that Judge Brett Kavanaugh attempted to sexually assault her at a party 35 years ago when they were both teenagers and he was ìstumbling drunkî at the time.Sen. Feinstein did nothing with Fordís letter. She did not alert the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), as is customary. She did not alert the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), so that they could include it in their background investigation of the nominee. She did not even alert her fellow Democrats on the Committee.†She would later claim that her lack of action was due to her desire to honor Fordís request for confidentiality.Early August 2018: Ford hired Debra Katz, a lawyer with a long history in Democratic politics who specializes in sexual harassment cases. On Katzís advice, Ford took a polygraph test. The results were later provided to the Washington Post, which reported that the test ìconcluded that Ford was being truthful when she said a statement summarizing her allegations was accurate.îLate August 2018: According to the Washington Post, in Late August, ìFord had decided not to come forward, calculating that doing so would upend her life and probably would not affect Kavanaughís confirmation. ëWhy suffer through the annihilation if itís not going to matter?í she said.îTuesday-Friday, September 4-7, 2018: The Senate Judiciary Committee held confirmation hearings with Kavanaugh from September 4 through 6. On Friday, September 7, they heard expert testimony from Kavanaughís supporters and detractors. This would have been the appropriate venue for Ford to present her accusations. However, if she desired to remain anonymous, Sen. Feinstein could have raised the allegations directly with Kavanaugh during any of the hearings on Tuesday through Thursday. Instead, the hearings concluded without any mention of Fordís allegations.Wednesday, September 12, 2018: Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee ìfirst learned about [Fordís] letterís contents at a meeting called at the last minute†on Wednesday night,î according to the Washington Post. The New York Times reported: ìSeveral Democrats advised [Feinstein] to take [the letterís] claims to the F.B.I., and others pressed for it to become public.îThe story of Fordís letter then†leaked†to the Intercept, which reported that ìDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have privately requested to view a Brett Kavanaugh-related document in possession of the panelís top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, but the senior California senator has so far refused, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation.îThursday, September 13, 2018: Feinstein finally issued a statement confirming the existence of the letter but declining to offer any details.ìI have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,î Feinstein wrote. ìThat individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities.îNEW: Sen. Feinstein: ìI have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court"" and ""referred the matter to federal investigative authorities.î pic.twitter.com/ORpIeiNhpIó NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) September 13, 2018The New York Times reported, ìThe F.B.I. said in a statement on Thursday that it had received Ms. Feinsteinís referral and included it in Judge Kavanaughís background file. A bureau official also said that no criminal investigation had been opened related to the matter.îThe updated copy of Kavanaughís file with the letter was then sent by the White House to Senate Judiciary Chairman Grassley, as is customary.ìIn addition to criminal investigations, the F.B.I. conducts background checks on all major government appointees, including Supreme Court nominees,î the Times noted.The media soon worked itself into a frenzy to discover the name of the accuser and the exact nature of her accusation, which the New York Times said†involved ìpossible sexual misconduct.îFord began to worry that her identity would become public after a Buzzfeed reporter turned up at her home and workplace and another reporter contacted her colleagues.In response to news of the mysterious letter, White House†spokesperson Kerri Kupec issued the following†statement:†ìThroughout his confirmation process, Judge Kavanaugh has had 65 meetings with senatorsóincluding with Senator Feinsteinósat through over 30 hours of testimony, addressed over 2,000 questions in a public setting and additional questions in a confidential.îìNot until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new ëinformationí about him,î the official added.Friday, September 14, 2018: Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer of The New Yorker got their hands on the contents of the letter and reported the most accurate description to date of the alleged incident.Sunday, September 16, 2018: Ford went on the record with the Washington Post revealing her name and conveying the entire incident in her own words. She told the Post, ìNow I feel like my civic responsibility is outweighing my anguish and terror about retaliation.îFordís lawyer Debra Katz told the Post: ìVictims must have the right to decide whether to come forward, especially in a political environment that is as ruthless as this one. She will now face vicious attacks by those who support this nominee.îFordís account to the Post also made clear that she was uncertain about key details, such as the exact date of the event, location, and how she got to the party and got home from it. She also revealed that she told no one about the incident until 2012, when she and her husband were in couples therapy. That year, Kavanaughís name was included in a short list of potential Supreme Court nominees for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.The notes Fordís therapistís wrote, which the Post acquired in part, contained glaring discrepancies about the incident. The therapist wrote that four boys were involved in the alleged assault, but Ford claimed that only two were: Kavanaugh and his friend, Mark Judge. The therapistís notes also do not contain Kavanaughís name. Ford blamed the discrepancies on the therapistís transcription.The editorial board of Sen. Feinsteinís hometown newspaper, the San Francisco Chronicle, denounced her handling of Fordís allegations, calling it ìunfair all around. It was unfair to Kavanaugh, unfair to his accuser and unfair to Feinsteinís colleagues ó Democrats and Republicans alike ó on the Senate Judiciary Committee.îMonday, September 17, 2018: President Trump said he was open to having the Senate Judiciary Committee delay the confirmation vote to consider Fordís allegation.ìI want the American people to be happy because theyíre getting somebody that is great. I want him to go in at the absolute highest level. And I think to do that you have to go through this. If it takes a little delay, itíll take a little delay,î Trump said.Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley issued the following statement:Anyone who comes forward as Dr. Ford has deserves to be heard, so I will continue working on a way to hear her out in an appropriate, precedented and respectful manner.The standard procedure for updates to any nomineeís background investigation file is to conduct separate follow-up calls with relevant parties.†In this case, that would entail phone calls with at least Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford. Consistent with that practice, I asked Senator Feinsteinís office yesterday to join me in scheduling these follow-ups. Thus far, they have refused. But as a necessary step in evaluating these claims, Iíll continue working to set them up.Unfortunately, committee Republicans have only known this personís identity from news reports for less than 24 hours and known about her allegations for less than a week. Senator Feinstein, on the other hand, has had this information for many weeks and deprived her colleagues of the information necessary to do our jobs. The Minority withheld even the anonymous allegations for six weeks, only to later decide that they were serious enough to investigate on the eve of the committee vote, after the vetting process had been completed.Itís deeply disturbing that the existence of these allegations were leaked in a way that seemed to preclude Dr. Fordís confidentiality.Over my nearly four decades in the Senate I have worked diligently to protect whistleblowers and get to the bottom of any issue. Dr. Fordís attorney could have approached my office, while keeping her client confidential and anonymous, so that these allegations could be thoroughly investigated. Nevertheless, we are working diligently to get to the bottom of these claims.Other Republican senators ó including crucial GOP swing votes ó†agreed with the need to hear from Ford.Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) said, ìProfessor Ford and Judge Kavanaugh should both testify under oath before the Judiciary Committee.îSen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said: ìIf they push forward without any attempt with hearing what sheís had to say, Iím not comfortable voting yes. We need to hear from her. And I donít think Iím alone in this.îSen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) said, ìI think [delaying the vote] might be something they might have to consider, at least having that discussion. This is not something that came up during the hearings. And if there is real substance to this, it demands a response.îSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), a member of the Judiciary Committee, said, ìIf Ms. Ford wishes to provide information to the committee, I would gladly listen to what she has to say and compare that against all other information we have received about Judge Kavanaugh.îNow that there was general agreement that Fordís testimony should be heard, the Democrats deftly moved the goalposts with a new demand that would delay the confirmation even more. They insisted that the FBI must conduct an investigation into Fordís allegations, despite the fact that the FBI had already fulfilled its obligation in this matter by including Fordís letter in Kavanaughís background file and forwarding it to the White House.Nevertheless, Sen. Feinstein tweeted, ìThereís a lot of information we donít know and the FBI should have the time it needs to review this new material.îSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) agreed, tweeting, ì[Senate Republicans] cannot impartially investigate these disturbing allegations. That must be done by the FBI, and the vote must be postponed until it is complete.îSenate Republicans ran a transparently partisan confirmation process and then immediately insinuated Prof Ford is being untruthful. They cannot impartially investigate these disturbing allegations. That must be done by the FBI, and the vote must be postponed until it is complete.ó Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) September 17, 2018Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats then sent a letter to Sen. Grassley demanding the vote on Kavanaugh be delayed for an FBI investigation.Their letter stated: ìAs you are aware, Dr. Fordís serious allegations were submitted to the FBI for investigation last week. Now that her story is public, it is even more important that we give the Bureau the time it needs to follow up. All Senators, regardless of party, should insist the FBI perform its due diligence and fully investigate the allegations as part of its review of Judge Kavanaughís background. Staff-level examination of these allegations should not go forward until the FBIís career professionals with the requisite investigative expertise have completed their review. Once the FBI has completed its independent work, we hope that we can work together in a bipartisan manner to decide on next steps.îThe Department of Justice shot down this talking point in a statement issued Monday night, declaring that the FBI can not and will not be investigating Fordís allegation because it†ìdoes not involve any potential federal crimeî and is therefore beyond the FBIís jurisdiction.The statement explained that the FBIís role in conducting a background investigation into a nominee is ìto determine whether the nominee could pose a risk to the national security of the United Statesî and then to provide that information ìfor the use of the decision makers.î The DOJ said, ìitís not the job of the FBI to judge the significance or the credibility of an accusation.îThat afternoon, Sen. Grassley issued a statement that the Judiciary Committee was attempting to reach Ford, who was not responding to their inquiries, but would cancel the confirmation vote scheduled for Thursday, September 20, and instead hold a public hearing on Fordís claim on Monday, September 25.ìAs I said earlier, anyone who comes forward as Dr. Ford has done deserves to be heard. My staff has reached out to Dr. Ford to hear her account, and they held a follow-up call with Judge Kavanaugh this afternoon.† Unfortunately, committee Democrats have refused to join us in this effort.†However, to provide ample transparency, we will hold a public hearing Monday to give these recent allegations a full airing,î†Grassley said.Tuesday, September 18, 2018:†Ignoring the Department of Justiceís prior statements on the matter, Senate Democrats sent a letter to FBI Director Chris Wray and White House Counsel Don McGahn demanding the FBI investigate Kavanaugh.They wrote:†ìThe need for the FBI to perform its due diligence has become even more important in light of Chairman Grassleyís announcement that he plans to move forward with a hearing on this matter next Monday. The Committee should have the completed report before any hearing occurs and we ask that you take immediate steps to make sure that we have the FBIís report before we proceed. Please notify us as soon as possible whether this can be completed in time.îWednesday, September 19, 2018:†Sen. Grassley responded to the Judiciary Committee Democratsí letter with a letter of his own detailing why their demand for an FBI investigation was totally unnecessary now that Fordís allegation has been made public. Such a demand, Grassley explained, was akin to demanding that the FBI do the Senateís job. It is now the duty of the Senate Judiciary Committee to call witnesses, gather evidence, and conduct the investigation going forward, not the FBI.Grassleyís letter stated (emphasis in the original):Your letter requests that I demand that the FBI conduct an additional investigation into this matter. This request demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the FBI background investigation process. Before nominating an individual to a judicial or executive office, the White House directs the FBI to conduct a background investigation. The FBI compiles information about a prospective nominee and sends it to the White House. The White House then provides FBI background investigation files to the Senate as a courtesy to help us determine whether to confirm a nominee. But the FBI does†not†make a credibility assessment of any information it receives with respect to a nominee. Nor is it tasked with investigating those matters that this Committee deems important. The Constitution assigns the Senate, and only the Senate, with the task of advising the President on his nominees and consenting if the circumstances merit. We have no power to commandeer an executive branch agency into conducting†our†due diligence. The job of assessing and investigating a nomineeís qualifications in order to decide whether to consent to the nomination is ours, and ours alone.Second, your request ignores the fact that Dr. Ford has already made her allegations public. The purpose of the background investigation process is to compile information in a†confidential†manner. Confidentiality permits people to speak freely and candidly about the character and qualifications of the nominee. The White House requires the Senate to keep background investigation files private so that people can speak anonymously to investigators if they so desire. Because Dr. Fordís allegations are in the public arena, there is no longer a need for a confidential FBI investigation.In this same letter, Sen. Grassley also†fact-checked the Democratsí claim that their request for an FBI investigation into Fordís allegation is no different than the way the FBI investigated Anita Hillís allegation against Clarence Thomas in 1991. He wrote (emphasis in the original):In 1991, the FBIís additional investigation into Professor Anita Hillís allegations occurred when the allegations were still non-public. When the Senate received Professor Hillís non-public allegations of sexual harassment, then-Chairman Biden expeditiously notified the White House. (That decision sits in sharp contrast to Senator Feinsteinís decision to sit on Dr. Fordís allegations for more than six weeks.) The White House directed the FBI to conduct a handful of interviews regarding Professor Hillís allegations. The FBI completed the interviews within a few days. The White House turned the interview reports over to the Senate as a courtesy. The contents of one of those reports was leaked to the public soon after. The hearing was subsequently reopened†five days†after the allegations were made public.We are in the same position the Committee was in†after†Professor Hillís allegations were leaked.†After that leak, we did not ask the FBI to conduct an investigation. Instead, we reopened the hearing and assessed the testimony that was given on our own. As in 1991, it is now up to the Senate to gather and assess the relevant evidence.On Wednesday, Sen. Grassley also sent a letter to Sen. Feinstein request she provide him and the rest of the Republicans on the Committee a copy of the letter submitted to her by Ford.Grassley wrote, ìMy staff has made repeated requests for this document ó which has become a significant piece of evidence in Judge Kavanaughís confirmation process ó but your staff has so far refused to provide a copy of the letter. You are able to share this unredacted copy with all the members of your caucus and their staff, as well as anyone else you choose. The only version we have of this letter is a redacted version contained in the supplemental FBI background investigation file that only senators and a handful of very select staff are authorized to read.îGrassley then called out Feinsteinís politicization of this process and total disregard for the wellbeing of the accuser, the accused, and her colleagues who want to get at the truth. He wrote (emphasis in the original):Sexual assault allegations deserve serious attention, and those who make such allegations must be heard. They should not be deployed strategically for political gain. You received this letter approximately seven weeks ago. But the contents of the letter were leaked only last week when it appeared the Senate was about to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. There were numerous opportunities to raise the serious allegations made in the letter during the course of this nomination process. They could have been raised in your closed-door meeting with Judge Kavanaugh on August 20. Sixty-four other senators also met with Judge Kavanaugh prior to his confirmation hearing. These senators could have asked Judge Kavanaugh about these allegations if you had shared the letter.Your staff could have raised these allegations during routine background investigation phone calls in late-August. Questions about these allegations could have been asked of Judge Kavanaugh during his more than 32 hours of testimony before the Committee over the course of three days. You could have asked him about these allegations during the closed session of his confirmation hearing, where sensitive material can be discussed. But you did not attend the closed session. Finally, these allegations could have been addressed in one of the nearly 1,300 written questions issued to him after the hearingómore written questions to any Supreme Court nominee than all prior Supreme Court nominees combined.You have said that you didnít raise Dr. Fordís allegations previously because you wanted to protect Dr. Fordís anonymity. But these allegations could have been raised to me, or to Judge Kavanaugh, while protecting Dr. Fordís anonymity. Indeed, the only version of her letter that I have is the redacted version from the FBI, which protected Dr. Fordís anonymity. Had Dr. Ford not made her allegations public via the Washington Post over the weekend, I still would not know her identity. The fact is that these allegations could have been raised both within the last seven weeks and in a way that protected Dr. Fordís anonymity. Instead, you chose to sit on the allegations until a politically opportune moment. I cannot overstate how disappointed I am in this decision. It has caused me to have to reopen the hearings for the fifth day of testimony, when we easily could haveóand should haveóraised these issues before or during the first four days of the hearing.Grassley also made clear that the committee would go out of its way to accommodate Ford so that she could provide her testimony in whatever manner was most comfortable for her ó even going so far as to send his staff to California to get Fordís testimony at her home so that she wouldnít have to travel to D.C.† He†wrote:Dr. Ford has asked for the opportunity to be heard in a hearing, and I believe she should have that opportunity. I recognize that testifying publicly about sexual assault allegations may be difficult for Dr. Ford, so I have offered her the opportunity to testify in any of four possible venues: (1) a public hearing; (2) a private hearing; (3) a public staff interview; or (4) a private staff interview. I am even willing to have my staff travel to Dr. Ford in Californiaóor anywhere elseóto obtain her testimony.Later that day, Fordís lawyer, Debra Katz, sent a letter to Sen. Grassley. Echoing the Senate Democratsí talking points, Katz demanded an FBI investigation on behalf of her client before she would provide any testimony. Katz also objected to any attempt to make her client ìtestify at the same table as Judge Kavanaughî or endure an ìinterrogationî from senators who donít believe her.Katzís letter stated:As you know, earlier this summer, Dr. Ford sought to tell her story, in confidence, so that lawmakers would have a fuller understanding of Brett Kavanaughís character and history. Only after the details of her experience were leaked did Dr. Ford make the reluctant decision to come forward publicly.In the 36 hours since her name became public, Dr. Ford has received a stunning amount of support from her community and from fellow citizens across our country. At the same time, however, her worst fears have materialized. She has been the target of vicious harassment and even death threats. As a result of these kind of threats, her family was forced to relocate out of their home. Her email has been hacked, and she has been impersonated online.While Dr. Fordís life was being turned upside down, you and your staff scheduled a public hearing for her to testify at the same table as Judge Kavanaugh in front of two dozen U.S. Senators on national television to relive this traumatic and harrowing incident. The hearing was scheduled for six short days from today and would include interrogation by Senators who appear to have made up their minds that she is ìmistakenî and ìmixed up.î While no sexual assault survivor should be subjected to such an ordeal, Dr. Ford wants to cooperate with the Committee and with law enforcement officials.As the Judiciary Committee has recognized and done before, an FBI investigation of the incident should be the first step in addressing her allegations. A full investigation by law enforcement officials will ensure that the crucial facts and witnesses in this matter are assessed in a non-partisan manner, and that the Committee is fully informed before conducting any hearing or making any decisions.Sen. Grassley responded in a letter to Fordís attorney, in which he solicitously offered her client the option of a private or public hearing and respectfully explained ó yet again ó why an FBI investigation was wholly unnecessary at this point now that the Senate was conducting its own investigation:As you know, I have reopened the hearing on Judge Kavanaughís nomination in light of Dr. Fordís allegations. That hearing will begin again on Monday, September 24, at 10:00 a.m. I have invited Dr. Ford to testify regarding her allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. And in recognition of how difficult it can be to discuss allegations of this kind in public, I have also offered her the choice of testifying in either a public or closed session of the hearing. In response to my invitation, however, you wrote yesterday that ìan FBI investigation of the incident should be the first step in addressing her allegations.îI certainly understand and respect Dr. Fordís desire for an investigation of her allegations. That is precisely what the Senate is doing. That is why our investigators have asked to speak with your client. That is why I have invited Dr. Ford to tell her story to the Senate and, if she so chooses, to the American people. It is not the FBIís role to investigate a matter such as this. Before nominating an individual to a judicial or executive office, the White House directs the FBI to conduct a background investigation. The FBI compiles information about a prospective nominee and sends it to the White House. The White House then provides FBI background investigation files to the Senate as a courtesy to help us determine whether to confirm a nominee. The FBI does not make a credibility assessment of any information it receives with respect to a nominee. Nor is it tasked with investigating a matter simply because the Committee deems it important. The Constitution assigns the Senate, and only the Senate, with the task of advising the President on his nominee and consenting to the nomination if the circumstances merit. We have no power to commandeer an Executive Branch agency into conducting our due diligence. The job of assessing and investigating a nomineeís qualifications in order to decide whether to consent to the nomination is ours, and ours alone.I have reopened the hearing because I believe that anyone who comes forward with allegations of sexual assault has a right to be heard, and because it is the Committeeís responsibility to fully evaluate the fitness of a nominee to the Supreme Court. I therefore want to give Dr. Ford an opportunity to tell her story to the Senate and, if she chooses, to the American people. I also want to give Judge Kavanaugh an opportunity to respond to the allegations. By hearing out both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh, the Committee will endeavor to discover the truth of the matter, and will be better able to make an informed judgment about Judge Kavanaughís nomination.Sen. Grassley then provided Katz with a deadline for confirming that her client would testify:You have stated repeatedly that Dr. Ford wants to tell her story. I sincerely hope that Dr. Ford will accept my invitation to do so, either privately or publicly, on Monday. In the meantime, my staff would still welcome the opportunity to speak with Dr. Ford at a time and place convenient to her. And I remind you that, consistent with Committee rules, Dr. Fordís prepared testimony and biography are due to the Committee by 10:00 a.m. on Friday, September 21, if she intends to testify on Monday.A report by Fox News†confirmed Grassleyís assertions that the FBI has no jurisdiction to investigate Fordís allegations because they do not involve a federal crime. An FBI source told the network, ìThis is a political issue, not a law enforcement one.îAnother source told Fox News, ìItís totally inappropriate for someone to demand we use law enforcement resources to investigate a 35-year-old allegation when she wonít go under oath and canít remember key details including when or where it happened.îìIn an FBI background investigation, the bureau is only responsible for finding information and passing it along, which they have done in the Kavanaugh case, a source said. The source said the FBI would not ëinvestigateí the information found,î Fox News reported.However, late Wednesday evening, another of Fordís lawyers, Lisa Banks, issued a new statement that shifted her clientís demands again ó now demanding a hearing for ìmultiple witnesses.îì[Ford] continues to believe that a full non-partisan investigation of this matter is needed and she is willing to cooperate with the Committee,î Banksí statement read. ìHowever, the Committeeís stated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigation; there are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding.The rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth.îJUST IN: Lawyer for Christine Blasey Ford issues new statement: ìThe rush to a hearing is unnecessary, and contrary to the Committee discovering the truth.î https://t.co/LvTe3kGtgN pic.twitter.com/bocCe54CvHó ABC News (@ABC) September 19, 2018Banks was perhaps alluding to the two other individuals named by Ford as being at the party 35 years ago when the alleged incident occurred. The two men, Mark Judge and†Patrick J. Smyth, both issued statements denying any knowledge of the incident and declining any invitation to speak further on the matter.Mark Judge stated that he had ìno recollection of any of the events describedî by Ford and that he ìnever saw Brett act that way.îIn a letter to Sens. Grassley and Feinstein, Smyth wrote, ìI am issuing this statement today to make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh.îìTo safeguard my own privacy and anonymity, I respectfully request that the Committee accept this statement in response to any inquiry the Committee may have,î he added.Thursday, September 20, 2018: On Thursday morning, the Senate Judiciary Committeeís official Twitter account tweeted out confirmation that they had contacted and obtained statements ìunder penalty of felonyî from Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, Patrick J. Smyth, and another person who was allegedly at the party where the incident occurred.In other words, the Committee was, in fact, reaching out to multiple witnesses ó including Cristina King Miranda, a classmate of Fordís who deleted her Facebook post claiming knowledge of the incident and later†admitted, ìThat it happened or not, I have no idea. I canít say that it did or didnít.îWithin hours of learning Dr. Fordís identity from press reports on Sunday Chairman Grassley took swift action making contact w the alleged witnesses.

And we would love to hear from Dr. Ford.

The Post reports that Katz is concerned that ìthe potential of an outside counsel coming in to question Fordî would ìwould be too much like a trial.îSecond, Kavanaugh cannot be in the hearing room when Ford gives her testimony.Third, Kavanaugh must give his testimony first, without the benefit of hearing the testimony of his accuser.Fourth, Ford wants the Senate Judiciary Committee to subpoena Mark Judge to testify.Finally, Katz suggested that Thursday, rather than Monday, ìwould be a good hearing date.îThis last request has great political significance because pushing the hearing to Thursday would mean Kavanaugh could not be confirmed in time to join the Supreme Court for its new session on October 1, as Republicans and the White House hope. (Breitbartís Joel Pollak explains why here.)Fox News reports that it ìwould be highly unusual for a witness before a Senate committee to dictate who receives a subpoena as a precondition to testifying.î However, CNN reporter Manu Raju tweeted that these demands were ìmostly asks and appear to be negotiable.îBefore his rally in Las Vegas, NV, on Thursday evening, President Trump told Fox Newsís Sean Hannity that he doesnít think the hearings should be delayed any further if Ford refuses to appear on Monday.ìI donít think you can delay it any longer. Theyíve delayed it a week already,î Trump said. ìThey have to get on with it.îFriday, September 21, 2018: The Senate Judiciary Committee has yet to respond to Fordís lawyerís demands.CNN reports that the Republican possible counter-offer to Ford includes a Wednesday hearing; Ford will testify first, followed by Kavanaugh; and questions will be asked by an independent counsel.BREAKING ON CNN: the LIKELY ñ key word, likely ñ GOP counteroffer to Prof. Ford is as follows 1) hearing Wednesday, 2) Ford testifies first, #Kavanaugh second, 3) Independent counsel asks questions. via @DanaBashCNN @Phil_Mattinglyó Catherine Valentine (@CNNValentine) September 21, 2018Update: NBC News also reports on the GOPís counter-offer to Ford, including the new detail that only two witnesses will be called and the Committee will ìpick a lawyer for questionî Ford.JUST IN: Judiciary Cmte.

I donít know if it will always be this way.îShe added, ì[Dr. Christine Blasey Ford] could, at any point, make that criminal complaint to the police in Maryland, who would not be bound by some expiration of the statute of limitations here. Such a complaint count start a criminal investigation conceivably of a sitting Supreme Court justice for felony attempted rape.

Yet they will do the same next year, if voters give them a chance to govern again.They intend on turning the House ó or the Senate ó into a Star Chamber that could make the McCarthy hearings look like a model of procedural fairness.They are not interested in oversight, any more than they want to hear from Christine Blasey Ford. They want to turn oversight into ìoverthrow.îMcClatchy briefly sketched Democratsí plans Thursday:Democrats want to examine President Donald Trumpís tax returns. Thereís talk of launching an independent commission into his administrationís handling of the hurricane that wracked Puerto Rico. Progressive activists are ready to start impeachment proceedings.Get ready. If Democrats take control of a chamber in the November election, expect a flood of hearings, investigations, probes and special commissions starting in January.Last month, a spreadsheet emerged that listed 100 investigations that Republicans believe Democrats will launch the moment Nancy Pelosi seizes the speakerís gavel. Many of them are redundant, or ridiculous, aimed only at embarrassing the president and preventing Congress from achieving anything more on his watch.For example, Democrats want to probe the payment to porn star Stormy Daniels ó a matter already in the ambitious grasp of the U.S. Attorney of the Southern District of New York.The ultimate goal is Trumpís impeachment, removal of office ó and, perhaps, worse. House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD), the second-ranking Democrat behind Pelosi, has†declared Trump guilty of ìtreason,î for which one punishment is death.Pelosi has tried to downplay the impeachment issue, without success, because the so-called ìResistanceî demands nothing less and because Tom Steyer, the partyís top donor in the last midterm election, is spending over $100 million promoting the cause.But even if Democrats do not succeed in ousting Trump ó thanks, in theory, to Republican opposition in the Senate ó they will destroy our democratic institutions in the process.In the Kavanaugh controversy, Democrats are backing a demand by Dr. Fordís attorney that the judge be required to speak†first ó before he has heard the accusations against him. It is a complete inversion of civil rights, one familiar to totalitarian dictatorships, and a preview of how Democrats will conduct ìoversight.îDemocrats have also demanded the FBI investigate Kavanaugh, for a seventh time. They have learned nothing from 2016 and are eager to use ó or abuse ó the powers of law enforcement for political gain.†And Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) helpfully offered this advice to American men: ìJust shut up.îSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA),†who is chiefly to blame for the way Democrats have handled the Kavanaugh accusation, was elected in 1992, after female voters marched to the polls to express their outrage at the way Anita Hill was questioned about her accusations against Clarence Thomas. She has predicted†2018 will be another ìyear of the woman,î and is determined to make it so.But there are also millions of American men ó and women ó who are outraged by what is happening to Kavanaugh. It is up to them to stop this liberal totalitarianism from taking over our country.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/09/20/politico-editor-in-chief-god-is-laughing-at-brett-kavanaugh/,"Politico Editor-in-Chief John Harris penned an op-ed on Monday suggesting that ìGod is laughing at Brett Kavanaugh,î noting the supposed irony that Kavanaugh once investigated Bill Clintonís infidelity only to have the Senate Judiciary Committee and the media now investigate a sexual misconduct allegation brought against the Supreme Court nominee.Harris wrote his op-ed one day after the Washington Post revealed that California psychology professor, Christine Blasey Ford, is the woman that now accuses Supreme Court Justice nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were both in high school in the 1980s.Ford alleges that back in 1982, a 17-year-old†Kavanaugh and a friend of his pulled Ford into a room during a high school party in suburban Maryland, forced her onto a bed, and groped her over her clothing before she was able to escape.The Politico chief noted the irony in this accusation considering that Kavanaugh spent his early 30s investigating Bill Clintonís ìmost intimate moral failings,î or his affair with then-21-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. And now the Senate Judiciary Committee and the media are investigating Kavanaughís alleged groping of a woman when he was in high school.ìGod, itís sometimes said, has an awesome sense of humor,î Harris remarked.The Politico head continued:So here was Kavanaughówho spent his early 30s as a Ken Starr warrior pursuing Bill Clinton for the political and legal implications of his most intimate moral failingsónow in his early 50s facing a political crisis over disturbingly vivid, passionately contested, decades-old allegations about Kavanaughís own possible moral failings.Few prosecutors, it seems likely, would ever open an assault caseó36 years lateróon the basis of Christine Blasey Fordís account of being pinned down on a bed by a drunken Kavanaugh, then 17, and being aggressively groped until a friend of his physically jumped in.Harris contends that few people would investigate a 36-year-old sexual assault accusation; however, few people would have also investigated a ìmiddle-aged manís lies about adultery if that person had not been President Bill Clinton.î The Politico chief†neglects to mention that President Clinton was impeached for lying under oath before a grand jury and for obstruction of justice, not for sexual impropriety.The comparison between Kavanaugh and Clinton also fails to note that President Clinton did, in fact, have an affair with Lewinsky during his presidency, while Kavanaugh has continued to vehemently deny the accusations brought against him.Now on Thursday, Ford has said that she is willing to testify before the committee next week, but not on Monday, ìso long as her safety is assured and hearing is fair.îNEW: Lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford have told Senate Judiciary Committee staff she is ""prepared to testify"" next week ó but not Monday ó so long as her safety is assured and hearing is fair.  My latest.  https://t.co/WiA3kXb2d8ó Sheryl Gay Stolberg (@SherylNYT) September 20, 2018Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) gave Ford and her lawyers until Friday morning to say if she plans to testify either in private or public.Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) suggested that, if Ford does not testify, the committee should move forward with Kavanaughís nomination, and key moderate senators are beginning to say the same.President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he would like to hear from Kavanaughís accuser despite her reluctance to testify. The president also said that the last-minute accusation revealed by Democrats was ìvery unfairî to Kavanaugh and his family.ìI can only say this: He is such an outstanding man. Very hard for me to imagine that anything happened,î Trump added.Harris concludes in his editorial, ìWith a vote on his career-long dream of serving on the high court scheduled for three days from now, Kavanaugh can be forgiven if he is not in an ironic frame of mind.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/20/trump-dems-trying-to-besmirch-kavanaugh-have-to-get-on-with-it/,"President Donald Trump on Thursday evening said Democrats are trying to ìbesmirchî Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and need to ìget on with itî without any more Senate Judiciary Committee delays.ìI donít think you can delay it any longer. Theyíve delayed it a week already,î Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity before a Las Vegas, Nevada, rally. ìThey have to get on with it.îBefore the rally, Trump told Hannity that he thinks ìitís a sad situationî and said that Kavanaugh is an ìoutstanding person.î Trump, referring to Christine Blasey Ford, the Northern California psychology professor who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, asked, ìWhy didnít somebody call the FBI 36 years ago?îìTo take a man like this and besmirch,î Trump said, adding that he has been ìaccommodating.î ìNow, with that being said, let her have her say and letís see how it all works out.îLater at the rally for Sen. Dean Heller (D-NV), Trump said, ìOne of the reasons I was elected was because you believed I was going to pick great Supreme Court Justices.îìBrett Kavanaughóand Iím not saying anything about anybody elseóbut I want to tell you that Brett Kavanaugh is one of the finest human beings you will have the privilege of knowing or meeting. A great intellect. A great gentleman. An impeccable reputation. Went to Yale. Top student. Went to Yale Law School. Top student,î Trump said at the rally. ìSo weíll let it play out, and I think everythingís going to be just fine. This is a high-quality person.îOn Thursday afternoon, Fordís lawyers told Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) that though Ford will not testify on Monday, Ford ìwishes to testify, provided that we can agree on terms that are fair and which ensure her safety.îìA hearing on Monday is not possible and the Committeeís insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event,î Fordís lawyers wrote Grassley, who had given Fordís team a Friday morning (10 a.m. ET) deadline to make their decision about testifying. ìDr. Ford has asked me to let you know that she appreciates the various options you have suggested. Her strong preference continues to be for the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow for a full investigation prior to her testimony.îKavanaugh also wrote Grassley and said he ìwill be thereî on Monday and looks ìforward to the opportunity to testify before the Committee.îìI continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name,î Kavanaugh wrote. ìSince the moment I first heard this allegation, I have categorically and unequivocally denied it.†I remain committed to defending my integrity.îOn Thursday evening, Fordís lawyers reportedly indicated that Ford could be willing to testify on Thursday of next week so long as certain conditions are met. Fordís lawyers reportedly are opposed to Senators using outside lawyers to question Ford. They also want Kavanaugh to testify first and to not be in the same room at the same time as Ford.Earlier in the week, Lisa Banks, one of Fordís lawyers, told CNNís Anderson Cooper that her client was ìnot preparedî to testify on Monday and indicated that Ford did not want to do so before a full FBI investigation into her allegations. Banks also claimed that the Judiciary Committeeís ìstated plan to move forward with a hearing that has only two witnesses is not a fair or good faith investigationî and added that ìthere are multiple witnesses whose names have appeared publicly and should be included in any proceeding.î

The longtime Democrat operative was also the deputy communications director during the Clinton years.One Republican official told Politico that†Seidmanís involvement ìfeels more like a Democratic super PAC than a legal effort to get at the truth.îAn email obtained by the New York Times reveals Ford has declined to testify on†Monday†and is instead proposing to appear before lawmakers on an unspecified day next week if given ìterms that are fair and which ensure her safety.î Appearing before the committee ìis not possible and the Committeeís insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event,î the email written by Fordís lawyer reads.In an interview with the†Washington Post†released over the weekend, Ford came forward with her allegations against Kavanaugh, in which she claimed the future judge pinned her down on a bed and proceeded to grope her during a Maryland house party in the 1980s.†Ford reportedly does not recall who organized the gathering or its exact time and date.Mike Judge, who Ford claims jumped atop her and Kavanaugh sending the pair tumbling to the ground, told the†Weekly Standard that the accusation is†ìabsolutely nuts.îLast Monday, Kavanaugh denied the allegation, issuing the following statement: ìThis is a completely false allegation.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/20/gillibrand-how-dare-republicans-not-even-afford-the-basic-courtesies-to-dr-ford/,"Thursday at a Capitol Hill press conference, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said Republicans were not giving ìbasic courtesiesî to Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct.Gillibrand said. ìI believe Dr. Blasey Ford because she is telling the truth and you know it by her story, by the fact she told her therapist from five years ago. It was documented at the time. We have the therapistís notes. She told her husband. This is a trauma she has been dealing with her whole life. She doesnít want to be in a bedroom that doesnít have two doors. People knew that about her a long time ago. They told a friend a year ago before Kavanaugh was ever named. These are the hallmarks of truth. These are the hallmarks of someone who has to be believed.îShe continued, ìShe fears if this person is confirmed he will do terrible things for American women. She is concerned he doesnít have the character, the integrity, the honesty to be a Supreme Court justice. I believe her because sheís telling the truth. Sheís asking the FBI to investigate her claims. Sheís asking for that kind of review, that investigative work, that oversight and accountability, because sheís telling the truth. Someone who is lying does not ask the FBI to investigate their claim. Who is not asking the FBI to investigate these claims? The White House. Judge Kavanaugh has not asked the FBI to investigate these claims. Is that the reaction of an innocent person? It is not. We have to get to the bottom of these claims before we put someone on the Supreme Court for life. Iím very concerned that they are unwilling to get to the bottom of this, donít want the facts. Even the Anita Hill hearing had an investigation, an FBI investigation, of her allegation in advance of the hearing. She had 22 witnesses, some of them corroborating witnesses. Those things are not being afforded Dr. Blasey Ford. They are the basics. This is not something thatís debatable or negotiable, or we only do it sometime. A background check is required for all judicial nominees, especially the Supreme Court, but they canít complete that background check if they donít investigate these claims. Right now we have an incomplete background investigation by the FBI.îShe added, ìShe is not asking for extraordinary measures. She is asking for basic fairness. This is about basic fairness. I do hope the American people, I do hope every woman in America is paying very close attention to what is happening in this body, in the U.S. Senate, today. This is not 1991 and how dare them not even afford the basic courtesies that were afforded them. They are not giving her an option. The option is show up Monday or donít show up at all. I consider that to be bullying. I consider that to be disregarding. I consider that to be something set up for failure. They would like a he said/she said scenario. Because you know what happens in those scenarios? The men are typically believed. You see those issues through your own lens. Why not have the witnesses? What are they afraid of? Why not have the therapist come in, her husband come in, her friend come in? Why not have Mark Judge testify under oath to the FBI and in front of the committee. What are they afraid of? What is this White House afraid of? What is this president afraid of? What is the U.S. Senate afraid of?† What are the Republican members of the judiciary afraid of? Those are the questions we need to ask today.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Although you probably deserve it,î another email read.On Wednesday, Mrs.†Kavanaugh is said to have received a note with the following subject line: ìF*** YOU AND YOUR RAPIST HUSBAND.îThe U.S. Marshals Service has yet to issue a statement regarding the matter.According to the Journal, ìOne person close to the confirmation process said that while Mrs. Kavanaugh is upset by the attacks on her husband, she doesnít want him to withdraw. Judge Kavanaugh himself hasnít considered withdrawing.îMrs. Kavanaugh, who serves as Town Manager of Marylandís Chevy Chase, met the future Supreme Court nominee while working in the George W. Bush White House.In addition to Mrs. Kavanaugh,†Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) has received†multiple threats in a bid to intimidate†her into voting against the Trump Supreme Court pick.ìMy office has received some pretty ugly voice mail threats, terrible things said to my staff, so this has been a very ugly process and I think thatís very unfortunate,î Collins told radio station†WVOM on Wednesday. Last week, Collinsís chief of staff, Steve Abbot, told a Maine television station, ìWeíve had some very abusive callersî regarding Kavanaughís nomination. ìWeíve had some very vulgar calls and sort of harassing the staff.îChristine Blasey Ford, the California psychology professor accusing Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a house party around 1982, has also been the subject of threats, according to her lawyer Debra Katz.†ìAs you are aware, she has been receiving death threats, which have been reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and she and her family have been forced out of their home, Katz wrote in an email sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.In a separate email, Fordís second lawyer, Lisa Banks, claimed†to lawmakers that the professor has faced ìvicious harassmentî after coming forward with her story.†ìAs a result of these kind of threats, her family was forced to relocate out of their home. Her email has been hacked, and she has been impersonated online,î the attorney wrote. According to the New York Times, Ford will meet with the FBI in†San Francisco Friday to discuss the threats.In a letter sent to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on Thursday, Kavanaugh confirmed he will appear before the committee on Monday to address the decades-old accusation. ìThank you for the invitation to appear before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on Monday, September 24.†I will be there.†I look forward to the opportunity to testify before the Committee,î wrote the Supreme Court nominee.Conversely, Ford has†declined†to testify on†Monday†and has proposed to appear before the committee on an unspecified day next week if offered ìterms that are fair and which ensure her safety.î According to Fordís attorney, meeting with lawmakers ìis not possible and the Committeeís insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event.î

I will be there. I look forward to the opportunity to testify before the Committee,î the Supreme Court nominee wrote. (Emphasis added.)The letter comes hours after Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of drunkenly groping, restraining, and attempting to undress her at a high school party more than 35 years ago, communicated through her lawyers that she was not willing to appear at the open hearing under oath Monday.Fordís lawyers made clear she was ìwilling to testifyî but that it was ìnot possibleî for her to do so Monday. Grassley previously offered the opportunity for Ford to address the committee behind closed doors at a bi-partisan conference and other Republican committee members reiterated Wednesday that Ford is still welcome to testify privately.By contrast, Kavanaugh expressed eagerness to defend himself further after having already done so to Judiciary Committee staff behind closed doors and stated he was willing to conduct the additional hearing as early as this past Tuesday. ìI also appreciate the time that Committee staff took to interview me on Monday, September 17. During that interview, I twice requested a Committee hearing for the following day, Tuesday, September 18,î Kavanaugh goes on. ìI continue to want a hearing as soon as possible, so that I can clear my name.îKavanaugh closes the letter with another denial of Fordís claims. ìSince the moment I first heard this allegation, I have categorically and unequivocally denied it. I remain committed to defending my integrity,î his letter reads.The Monday hearing already represents a delay to Kavanaughís confirmation process. He had been scheduled to come up for a committee vote this Thursday, the last hurdle before a final full-Senate debate and vote, when Fordís allegations surfaced over the weekend. During his four days of public hearings, no mention was made of the alleged incident despite ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) having been in possession of a letter from Ford detailing her account for weeks.Democrats, including Feinstein, are now claiming the Monday hearing is too soon and that the FBI needs to investigate the allegation first:This is exactly right.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/20/pence-accuser-should-be-heard-but-democrats-unfair-to-kavanaugh-and-his-family/,"Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday that he and President Donald Trump want to hear from Christine Blasey Ford ó the woman who has accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of attacking her in high school ó but that the ìprocessî the Democrats have used to put last-minute doubt into the confirmation process has been unfair to Kavanaugh and his family.ìLet me just say to begin with that I had the opportunity to meet Judge Kavanaugh before the president made a decision, and to review his record,î Pence told Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council on his Washington Watch radio program. Pence went on to say:Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a man of integrity, deeply committed to his family, with a lifetime of service to this country in a variety of roles. On the District of Columbia Court of Appeals more than 300 opinions that reflect a strong and principled judicial philosophy that again interprets statutes as written, will interpret the Constitution as written, will not legislate from the bench, and we believe that he will make an outstanding justice to the Supreme Court of the United States.That being said, as President Trump has said over the last several days, with the allegations that have emerged, itís important that we give it time, that we hear from both sides, and we have every confidence that Senator Grassley and the Republicans in the Senate will handle these allegations properly. I know Senator Grassley has laid forward a range of options from an open session hearing to a closed session to private staff interviews, and theyíve already ó the staff and the judiciary committee has already begun following up on leads ó following Dr. Fordís allegations. And thatís all very important.And again ó weíre confident the Senate will handle it, but that being said, what Senator Diane Feinstein has done here ó what Democrats in the Senate have done here ó is very unfair to Judge Brett Kavanaugh and it is a great disservice to the process. The fact that Senator Feinstein apparently had this letter more than six weeks ago, never raised the issue in her interview with Judge Brett Kavanaugh, never brought the issue to the attention of other members of the judiciary committee, itís a great disservice to the process, and to the American people, and, of course, to Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his family.Pence also said the Democratic senators on the Judiciary committee also harmed the confirmation process by how they handled questioning Kavanaugh at the hearings.ìAnd frankly, it follows on conduct by many Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee who I think virtually embarrassed themselves during the public hearings that were on display just a few short days ago,î Pence said. ìSo, that being said, I would just say the president and I believe that Judge Brett Kavanaugh will make an outstanding addition to the Supreme Court of the United States.îìWeíre very confident that the Senate will handle this all in a proper and appropriate way,î Pence said.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/20/kavanaugh-accuser-refuses-to-appear-monday-prepared-to-testify/,"Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaughís accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, will not appear at the Monday hearing Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) set to address her claims, her attorneys wrote Thursday.The New York Times published†portions of an email from Fordís lawyers to Judiciary Committee staff claiming it ìis not possibleî for her to appear Monday and that the ìCommitteeís insistence that it occur then is arbitrary in any event.î Ford ìwould be prepared to testify next week,î but only on ìterms that are fair and which ensure her safety.îThe Monday hearing was set to discuss, under oath, Fordís accusation that more than 35 years ago, a 17-year-old Kavanaugh had pulled her into a room at a high school party with another teenager and groped her. The email made clear she would not appear at the Monday hearing at which Kavanaugh has already agreed to testify.Grassley had set a Friday morning deadline for Ford to let the Judiciary Committee know if she would appear. He has also stated that the hearing may be cancelled if Ford refuses to testify.Grassley, who first suggested Ford and Kavanaugh address the accusation in a bipartisan conference call, then offered a full, open-door hearing under oath and set a date for Monday. Other Republican senators, like Susan Collins (R-ME), also made clear that Ford would have an option to testify in private with or without Kavanaughís presence if she so preferred:I hope that Dr. Ford will reconsider and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. It is my understanding that the Committee has offered to hold either a public or a private session, whichever would make her more comfortable.ó Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) September 19, 2018Fordís camp and the Democrats opposed to Kavanaughís confirmation quickly balked, demanding an ìFBI investigationî despite the Department of Justiceís repeated assertion that the accusation, as it involves no potential federal crime, is not under the Bureauís general investigative jurisdiction and that their role in background investigations for nominees†does not include credibility determinations.ìThe FBI make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation.†The purpose of a background investigation is to determine whether the nominee could pose a risk to the national security of the United States,î a Justice Department spokesman said in a statement.ìIt is important to remember that an FBI background investigation is entirely different from an FBI criminal investigation,î a former federal prosecutor further explained to Breitbart News Thursday. ìThe letter referred by Feinstein has already been added to Kavanaughís file, so the normal background element is complete.îìWhat Ford is now asking for with a full investigation would be a criminal investigation,î the prosecutor went on. ìThe FBI does not do that when there is no federal crime being alleged.îFordís lawyersí email appears to drop this demand for an FBI investigation after Fordís lead attorney, Democratic donor Debroah Katz, claimed Tuesday that her client would not testify without such an investigation. The letter states a†ìstrong preferenceî for ìa full investigationî but reportedly does not mention the FBI.The New York Timesís report notes no specific reasons for further delay, but notes that Katz hopes to set up a call Thursday evening to†ìdiscuss the conditionsî for her clientís testimony. The scheduling of the Monday hearing was already a delay on Kavanaughís confirmation process, which included four days of public hearings at which Fordís allegations were never mentioned and was set for a committee vote Thursday. A letter detailing Fordís claims was in Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinsteinís (D-CA) possession during the entirety of Kavanaughís original hearing and for several weeks before.The email also makes notes of ìdeath threatsî and Ford an her family being ìforced out of their home,î and implied her ìsafetyî was one of the conditions for her appearing in on Capitol Hill.

Hatch and Grassley, there for Anita Hill, who called for an FBI investigation, and rightly so in those years, are walking away from their own precedents on the committee.

She has to go under oath.îDershowitz noted an accusedís right to challenge his or her accuser within Americaís justice system and broader Western legal history.ìShe has to testify,î Dershowitz said. ìNobody should be referring to her as a victim or him as a perpetrator until we hear from both of them under oath [and] subject to cross examination. There is nothing more essential to American justice than the opportunity to cross examine your accuser, to confront your accuser. Itís in the Constitution. Essentially, it goes back to Magna Carta.îDershowitz went on, ìThe idea that weíre calling somebody a perpetrator and somebody else a victim based solely on he-said-she-said is just wrong, and itís un-American. She should testify. They should also call in [Mark] Judge and any other witnesses who were at the party, who claim they werenít at the party. Sure, let them broaden it beyond the two of them.îìNeither men nor women were born with a gene to lie or tell the truth. Women lie. Men lie. Women forget. Men forget. These are very emotional issues.îDershowitz described the ìMe Tooî campaign as framing men accused of sexual improprieties and/or crimes as guilty until proven innocent.ìThatís whatís happened today with the Me Too movement,î remarked Dershowitz. ìIn fact, in many respects, men are denied even the opportunity to prove their innocence. In colleges and universities today, itís enough for a preponderance of the evidence ó that means 51 percent ó that means 49 out of every 100 people accused on a college campus and convicted may well be innocent.îFollow Robert Kraychik on Twitter†@rkraychik.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2018/09/20/huffpost-bombshell-reveals-kavanaughs-female-clerks-advised-look-outgoing/,"An anonymous woman told HuffPost she was ìwarnedî to look ìoutgoingî if she wanted a job clerking for Brett Kavanaugh.Kavanaugh is the Supreme Court nominee whose confirmation has been temporarily stalled due to a 36-year-old sexual misconduct accusation leveled at the last possible moment. Kavanaugh says the alleged incident (when he was 17) did not occur. Two witnesses back him up.To bring Kavanaugh down, the media are currently throwing whatever it can against the wall in the hopes of peeling off enough moderate Republican senators to kill his confirmation chances.And for that reason, a wildly misleading HuffPost headline reads, ìBrett Kavanaugh Liked Female Clerks Who Looked A ëCertain Way,í Yale Student Was Told.îBut if you actually read the story, that is not even close to the truth.Naturally, the truth is buried under a dozen or so paragraphs of innuendo.The storyís opening makes it sound as though Kavanaugh is grooming female law clerks for something untoward:A few years ago, as she was prepping to interview for a judicial clerkship, a student at Yale Law School received a troubling combination of warning and advice from her professors about one federal judge in particular: Brett Kavanaugh, she was told, liked his female clerks to have a ìcertain look.îHuffPost then links the Kavanaugh dress code ìwarningî to former appeals court judge Alex Kozinski, who retired last year under a cloud of harassment allegations: ì[She was warned] about two judges in particular: First, Alex Kozinski, then a judge on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, was known to sexually harass his clerks, he told her. (Kozinski retired in December amid accusations of harassment.)îAt first, HuffPost tells us this anonymous woman did not know what that ìcertain lookî was, stating only ìIt was very clear to me that he was talking about physical appearance, because it was phrased as a warning <U+2015> and because it came after the warning about Judge Kozinski.îBut a full fifteen paragraphs into the piece, we discover that she was, in fact, told what a ìcertain lookî meant.It meantÖìOutgoing.îYes, you read that correctly; people are telling budding law clerks that Brett Kavanaugh wants female law clerks to look ìoutgoing,î which the dictionary defines as ìfriendly and socially confident; extroverted.îMerriam-Webster uses ìoutgoingî this way in a sentence: ìHis†outgoing†personality made him popular at school.îIn other words, you should dress for success, with confidence, sharp, ready to conquer the world, to succeed Ö and not like a granola with a chip on your shoulder.Moreover, the person giving this ìoutgoingî advice is Ö a woman. Her name is Amy Chau, and she is a Yale Law School professor. The other person offering the advice is Chauís husband, Jed Rubenfeld, also a Yale professor.Without explanation, HuffPost describes Chau as ìcontroversial.îSomehow, though, the HuffPost story gets worse.A full 16 paragraphs in, we learn this advice might have been meant especially for this anonymous woman.ìThe woman said she was not sure if Chua was giving this advice to others,î HuffPost is forced to admit.ìA friend suggested that the student needed the advice because she was ëawkward,í according to a transcript of a Gchat conversation that the Yale student had at the time and that was viewed by HuffPost.îAnd so, if you read between the lines, it sounds as though this anonymous law student dressed like a slob, and a couple of concerned professors, hoping to advance her career, brought this to her attention in the most diplomatic way possible.For her part, Chau supports Kavanaughís nomination and says she has placed ten clerks with him over the years, eight of them women, one of them her own daughter.ìAs I wrote in the Wall Street Journal, he has also been an exceptional mentor to his female clerks,î Chau told HuffPost. ìAmong my proudest moments as a parent was the day I learned our daughter would join those ranks.îA full 22 paragraphs into the piece, HuffPost finally informs readers, ìGiving law students advice on what to wear to an interview isnít terribly odd.îOf course, this is followed by a ìbut.îìÖbut the particular warning about Kavanaugh is unusual.îA columnist told HuffPost the advice is ìsexist.îExcept it is not Kavanaugh offering the advice; it is a professional woman motivated to help other women.Oh, and despite her misgivings about appearing ìoutgoing,î despite her ìmixed feelingsî about Kavanaugh, this anonymous woman still interviewed with him.Obviously, she did not get the job.Just one week ago, according to the media, Kavanaugh was a teenage ìrapist.î Now the media are reduced to publishing misleading headlines, followed by a pile of dishonest paragraphs that are only there to bury the inconvenient truth of Kavanaughís stellar record when it comes to advancing the careers of ìoutgoingî women.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

A sexual assault victim canít sleep in her home tonight because of threats,î Swalwell tweeted, referring to reports Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford has received death threats. ìSheís on her own while you and your @SenateGOP colleagues try to rush through a hearing.îIn his now-deleted tweet, Swalwell ó who is considering a presidential run in 2020 ó responded to a Hill article detailing the threatening voicemails and phone calls Collinsí office received:ìMy office has received some pretty ugly voicemails, threats, terrible things said to my staff,î Collins said in an interview with WVOM on Wednesday.ÖìWeíve had some very abusive callers. Ö Weíve had some very vulgar calls and sort of harassing the staff,î Steve Abbot, Collinsís chief of staff, told a Maine TV station at the time.ÖìHave you seen the emails Ö where he talked about Roe v. Wade not being settled law. He [bleeped] lied to you. How [bleeped] naive do you have to be?î the caller in the voicemail said.Just last week, in a widely reported story, on top of other threats and acts of intimidation, Collinsí office received a rape threat:ìThe [leftís] frustration has boiled over at points,î the†Times†understates. ìAnnie Clark, a spokeswoman for Ms. Collins, provided The New York Times with copies of a letter and multiple voice mail messages addressed to the senator using vulgar language and outright threats.îOne example of a threat is a ìcaller [who] told a 25-year-old female staff member at one of Ms. Collinsís Maine offices that he hoped she would be raped and impregnated.îBoth Thursdayís Hill report and last weekís report in the far-left New York Times document threats only coming from those opposed to Kavanaughís nomination.Under pressure, Swalwell later tweeted out an apology. ìSexual assault victims deserve respect. And senators shouldnít be threatened by the public,î he said. ìI said something stupid and minimized ugly behavior. That tweet is deleted and Iím sorry for that.îThis minimizing of threats against Republicans comes less than two weeks after a Republican congressional candidate ó running for Swalwellís seat ó†was attacked with a knife by man†making ìdisparagingî and ìprofanity-lacedî remarks about President Donald Trump and the Republican Party. During that same week, a shooting threat was made against Trump supporters gathering Washington, DC.Breitbart News has documented over 560 separate acts of violence, vandalism, intimidation, and harassment committed by leftists against Republicans.Nevertheless, elected Democrats like Swalwell and his allies in the establishment media continue to both ignore and stoke this ongoing epidemic of political violence.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

For instance, on Tuesday, ABC Newsí chief political analyst Matthew Dowd also labeled Thomas a ìsexual Predator,î despite the fact that the Justice was found not guilty of the sexual harassment charges he faced during his own confirmation hearings in 1991.Indeed, the FBI took three days to investigate the allegations of sexual harassment submitted by Anita Hill and at the conclusion of that investigative review, the agency said that Hillís charges were unfounded.But Hillís accusations were heard during the actual confirmation hearings, not afterward. Today, Democrats want Christine Blasey Fordís allegations heard despite that the actual confirmation hearings are long over and despite that these sudden accusations of sexual assault were not made public for 35 years.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/09/20/samantha-bee-brett-kavanaugh-accuser-did-america-a-favor/,"TBS late-night host Samantha Bee insists that Brett Kavanaughís accuser ìdid America a favorî by coming forward with her hazy accusations that the judge sexually assaulted her over 30 years ago.On her Wednesday evening broadcast of Full Frontal, Bee suggested that anyone supporting Kavanaugh is doing it because they are ìconfessing to something themselves,î and went on piously to proclaim that itís ìnever OK to rape somebody,î even though Kavanaugh was accused of groping, but not necessarily of rape.Bee concluded that the accuser ìdid America a favorî coming forward with her accusations.ìChristine Blasey Ford didnít ask for any of this shit,î Bee proclaimed. ìShe did America a favor by coming forward with extremely relevant background information about an important job applicant.îComedienne Sarah Silverman also chimed in to attack Kavanaugh. Silverman targeted the SCOTUS nominee on her Hulu show, I Love You, America. Indeed, Silverman imagined that Ford is ìbraveî for coming forward with her hazy memories about a 35-year-old alleged assault.ìI think sheís doing something really brave,î Silverman exclaimed. ìAnd now in this time when we should be thoroughly vetting Kavanaugh, we are vetting her. Someone who is exposing her personal life at the expense of her entire life. And sheís OK with it because thatís the code she lives by.îOf course, Kavanaugh has received a lot of vetting already. Not only has he undergone six deep dive FBI background checks, but he has also already been unanimously confirmed to the second highest court in the land.As to the accuser, despite all the lauding of Ford and the pleas for the Senate to allow her to ìtell her story,î the accuser has thus far refused to do just that and has turned down repeated offers to appear before the U.S. Senate to tell her tale and answer questions about her supposed encounter with a teenaged Brett Kavanaugh.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.

ìI hope that she does, because Iím afraid that what the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee really want is they want her to go away,î Schiff replied. ìThey donít want the country to hear from her, and they certainly donít want the country to hear from her live and on television.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) tweeted the video out and asked, ìIs this really what American wants in its next Supreme Court Justice?îAs far as CNN is concerned, there are actually two falsehoods in the segment embedded below. The first is the CNN chyron that claims the GOP is ìpushingî Kavanaughís accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.This is simply not true. Through her attorney, Ford had said she wanted to tell her story and the GOP is simply asking her to do so under oath. If she chooses not to, which now appears to be the case, she chooses not to.Whatís more, the GOP is obviously trying to accommodate her, and has even offered to hold the hearing in a private session. The truth is that Ford has now aligned herself with Democrats in calling for a FBI investigation into her allegations, even after the FBI said local crimes are not in its jurisdiction. Many see this as a stalling tactic as Democrats hope to run out the clock until the midterms.Acosta is even more dishonest than the chyron.Acosta airs video of Kavanaugh giving a speech in 2015 where he jokes about ìWhat happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep.î thinkîAfter the clip, Acosta gravely informs CNN viewers that this video ìis not a conclusive piece of video that says that he did anything, but it does speak to Ö this notion that perhaps there are portions of his childhood that he would rather not come to light.îJim Acosta on the 2015 Kavanaugh clip (which CNN edits so it begins after the reference to his three male friends): ìThere are portions of his childhood heíd rather not come to light."" Note how even Susan Hennessy thinks he's reaching. pic.twitter.com/swDqI2YcHhó Tom Elliott (@tomselliott) September 18, 2018In other words, hereís a smoking gun proving Kavanaugh is covering up things he did during his high school days.But here is what Acosta and the far-left CNN do not want you to know ó that Kavanaugh was specifically referring to three of his former classmates, with whom he has remained friends. It was a laugh line (referring to the famous Las Vegas slogan) and was not in any way a ìmoral code.îMoreover, the friends he names are not involved in Fordís allegations. Here is the FULL context of Kavanaughís remarks to the Columbus School of Law:By coincidence, three classmates of mine at Georgetown Prep were graduates of this law school in 1990, and are really, really good friends of mine ó [names his friends], and they were good friends of mine then and are still good friends of mine as recently as this weekend when we were all on email together. But fortunately we had a good saying that weíve held firm to this day as the Dean was reminding me before the talk, which is, ëWhat happens at Georgetown Prep stays at Georgetown Prep.í Thatís been a good thing for all of us, I think.In the past, Acosta has been caught being wildly dishonest in his attacks on Trump.

Maybe the party was at Haven Monahanís house. (He was the instigator of the fraternity gang rape reported in Rolling Stone, which never happened and ó luckily for Monahan! ó who doesnít exist. Otherwise, he was in BIG trouble.)But the psychology professor at Palo Alto University ó who recently signed a letter denouncing President Trumpís border policies (thank you, Attorney General Sessions!) ó says a teenaged Kavanaugh threw her on a bed at a party and began groping her, trying to take off her clothes.Hereís the kicker: ìI thought he might inadvertently kill me.îWe went pretty quickly from drunken teenaged groping to manslaughter.This is always my favorite part of any feminist claim: The leap from ìhe used a bad wordî to ìHE ADMITTED COMMITTING SEXUAL ASSAULT!î (Thatís what the media lyingly said about Trumpís remarks on the ìAccess Hollywoodî tape, as detailed in Chapter Two of my new book, Resistance Is Futile!: How the Trump-Hating Left Lost Its Collective Mind.)Kavanaugh emphatically denies that anything of the sort ever occurred at any party, but feminists are already off on, Maybe heís one of these sick people who rapes corpses!Itís also great how the media act as if attempted rape was perfectly acceptable in America, until we were educated by the #MeToo movement. No, the breakthrough of the #MeToo movement was that it was finally acceptable to call out liberal sexual predators.Until recently, it was OK to rape and even murder girls ó but only if your name was ìClinton,î ìKennedyî or ìWeinstein,î et al. Then Hillary lost, and Teddy was dead, so there was no point in ferociously protecting the Democratsí rapists any longer.Thus, for example, The New York Times defended Blasey Fordís failure to tell anyone about the alleged groping/manslaughter for 30 years, claiming things were different in the 1980s. ìMore likely,î the editorial explained, ìa girl in the early 1980s would have blamed herself than report it.îAs proof, the Times linked to a Washington Post article citing the Timesí own treatment of a Kennedy victim. After Patricia Bowman accused William Kennedy Smith of rape, the Times ìreported on her speeding tickets, partying in adulthood and even dredged up an unnamed woman who claimed Bowman showed a ëlittle wild streakí in high school.îSo the Timesí defense of the decades-old, therapy-induced recovered memory by Kavanaughís accuser is, Look at the way we abused a Kennedy accuser! We were horrible to her! OK, New York Times, you win.Most hilarious is the mediaís insistence that Kavanaughís accuser is putting herself at enormous risk by coming forward.Oh, cut the crap, media. In terms of press coverage, no one alive would prefer to be Kavanaugh than his accuser. Everywhere you look, someone is praising the ìsurvivorî for her stunning, unprecedented courage as she viciously tries to derail Kavanaughís nomination.True, accuse a Clinton, a Kennedy or a Weinstein (et al), and youíll be treated like dirt. Youíll get the Patricia Bowman treatment. Paula Jones was smeared and laughed at for three years, until Stuart Taylorís 15,000-word article defending her in the American Lawyer. (That took courage.)But accuse the elitist white male Duke lacrosse team, Haven Monahan or a Republican nominee to the Supreme Court, and you can upgrade to a much better university and spend the rest of your life being showered with awards, fellowships, honorary degrees, media appearances and so on. Look up ìAnita Hill.îAnd, boy, was Hill right about Clarence Thomas! (Honorary white male.) He got confirmed, and now he issues conservative rulings. We warned you.Following days of the entire media demanding that the victim (by which they mean the accuser) be allowed to tell her story, it turns out sheíd really rather not. Blasey Ford spent an eternity deciding whether to accept the Senateís invitation to testify, finally announcing on Tuesday night that she would appear only after a thorough and complete FBI investigation.Tell me what an ìinvestigationî of this matter involves. Do agents go door to door in Montgomery County, Maryland asking everyone who went to high school in the early 1980s if they remember going to some kind of party?Second: ITíS NEVER THE VICTIM WHO NEEDS AN INVESTIGATION! She knows what her story is. Itís the accused who wants an investigation to know exactly what heís accused of.Blasey Ford already knows what she thinks happened. Iíve been waiting my whole life to unburden myself about that night in 1981, 1982 or 1983 in a dark bedroom. Well, Iím not sure if it was a bedroom, but it definitely had a door. And a ceiling and a floor-ish kind of thing. And walls ó I know I was surrounded by walls. I remember thinking, ìOH MY GOSH, IíM IN A CLOSED SPACE!î On one hand, walls keep me warm, but thatís also why Iíve never enjoyed sex.The only reason for the professor to insist upon an ìinvestigationî is to delay having to give her story under oath until she knows what can be proved ó and what can be disproved.Of course, the main purpose of an ìinvestigationî is to give the media time to browbeat Republicans into withdrawing Kavanaughís name and doing the honorable thing by nominating someone more suitable.

Susan Collins (R-ME) publicly asked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford Wednesday afternoon to ìreconsiderî testifying before the Senate with her story of an alleged high school sexual assault from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.ìI hope that Dr. Ford will reconsider and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday,î Collins wrote on her Twitter account. ìIt is my understanding that the Committee has offered to hold either a public or a private session, whichever would make her more comfortable.îI hope that Dr. Ford will reconsider and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Monday. It is my understanding that the Committee has offered to hold either a public or a private session, whichever would make her more comfortable.ó Sen. Susan Collins (@SenatorCollins) September 19, 2018Fordís attorney Debra Katz said Tuesday night that her client will not testify before the Judiciary Committee until the FBI completes an investigation into her allegation that Kavanaugh pinned her down on a bed during a drunken party when the now-judge was 17 years old. However, the Bureau has said on multiple occasions to multiple news outlets that it has no jurisdiction and no plans to investigate Fordís charge.Breitbart Newsí senior legal editor Ken Klukowski reports that the FBI cannot take any action on Fordís claims unless President Trump expressly orders them to do so:ìIt is important to remember that an FBI background investigation is entirely different from an FBI criminal investigation,î a former federal prosecutor told Breitbart News. ìThe letter referred by Feinstein has already been added to Kavanaughís file, so the normal background element is complete.îìWhat Ford is now asking for with a full investigation would be a criminal investigation,î the prosecutor continued. ìThe FBI does not do that when there is no federal crime being alleged.îAnother source explains that the purpose of an FBI background investigation is to allow people to provide information in a strictly confidential manner, including secret accusations. Because Ford is making her accusations publicly, there is no role whatsoever for the FBI to play in collecting anonymous or confidential information.The only way the FBI would get involved is if President Trump took the extraordinary action of ordering the FBI to do so. But that creates a no-win situation because then the presidentís opponents who are currently attacking Kavanaugh could accuse the White House of political interference with a law enforcement investigation, directing an agency to act outside its jurisdiction. Some could even call a presidential order for the FBI to investigate a state-law matter to be an abuse of power.In spite of these facts, Democratic pundits and lawmakers continue to demand an FBI investigation into Kavanaughís high school conduct.Collins, long known for being a more liberal Republican, has faced pressure from far-left activists to vote against Kavanaughís confirmation to the Supreme Court. However, this latest statement echoes calls from Never-Trump senators Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Bob Corker (R-TN) urging Ford to take advantage of the opportunities to testify provided by committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA).ìI now implore Dr. Ford to accept the invitation for Monday, in a public or private setting,î Flake tweeted Wednesday. ìThe committee should hear her voice.îWhen Dr. Ford came forward, I said that her voice should be heard and asked the Judiciary Committee to delay its vote on Judge Kavanaugh. It did so. I now implore Dr. Ford to accept the invitation for Monday, in a public or private setting. The committee should hear her voice.ó Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) September 19, 2018Corker went farther, framing the delayed Monday hearing as a final deadline. ìIf we donít hear from both sides on Monday, letís vote,î he wrote.After learning of the allegation, Chairman @ChuckGrassley took immediate action to ensure both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh have the opportunity to be heard, in public or private. Republicans extended a hand in good faith. If we donít hear from both sides on Monday, letís vote.ó Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) September 19, 2018

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/19/chuck-grassley-gives-christine-blasey-ford-until-friday-to-say-if-shell-testify/,"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) sent a letter on Wednesday to California psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford saying she has until Friday to tell whether she intends to testify before the committeeís hearing on Monday regarding her accusation that Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Ford when they were both in high school.Chairman Grassley sent a letter to Fordís lawyers, requesting Grassley to either testify in public or private before the committee on Monday.Ford has so far declined to say whether she will testify Monday and instead asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate the case; The agency has declined to do so.Ford now alleges that back in the 1980ís, a 17-year-old†Kavanaugh and a friend of his allegedly pulled Ford into a room during a high school party in suburban Maryland, forced her onto a bed and groped her over her clothing before she was able to escape.Grassley said Tuesday that Mondayís hearing with Ford and Kavanaugh could be canceled if Ford does not testify on Monday, suggesting that it would be pointless without her testimony.Chairman Grassley asked rhetorically, ìDo they want to have the hearing or not? Weíre delaying the vote strictly to get all the facts out on the table. What would be the purpose of the hearing if Dr. Ford doesnít want to respond?îIn the letter to Fordís lawyers, Grassley rebuked the call for an FBI investigation into her allegation against Kavanaugh, stating that the FBI has already conducted a background check into any executive or judicial nominee. Instead, the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman contended that only the Senate could determine the worthiness of a Supreme Court nominee.Grassley explained:The Constitution assigns the Senate, and only the Senate, with the task of advising the President on his nominee and consenting to the nomination if the circumstances merit. We have no power to commandeer an Executive Branch agency into conducting our due diligenence. The job of assessing and investigating a nomineeís qualifications in order to decide whether to consent to the nomination is ours, and ours alone.Sen. Grassley also said that ìanyone who comes forward with allegations of sexual assault has a right to be heard,î and he wants to give Ford an opportunity to tell her story to the Senate and ìif she chooses, to the American people.îNEW Ltr from @ChuckGrassley to Dr Fordís attorneys encouraging her to appear before the Judiciary Committee regarding the Kavanaugh allegation: pic.twitter.com/GcrEQDTGlPó Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) September 19, 2018The Iowa senator then said that he also wants to give Judge Kavanaugh an opportunity to respond to the allegations.Chairman Grassley concluded in his letter that Dr. Ford has until Friday morning to inform the Senate Judiciary Committee whether she intends to testify on Monday.Sen.

They are creating a false choice. They are trying to bully her into testifying Monday, before a full FBI check is completed. Firstónomination for the Supreme Court and any judicial nominationóthere is always an FBI investigation. They do it as part of the background check. This allegation is new so they need a thorough, nonpartisan review of the facts so there can be a proper hearing. Unfortunately, they are trying to set up a he said/she said scenario, and bullying her into testifying Monday or not being heard at all.îShe continued, ìWe are asking for a basic review of the facts. If you are listening to Anita Hill herself, she said that you need to push the pause button to do this nonpartisan investigation before the senators have the information that they need to ask appropriate questions. Make no mistake about this, this is a false choice and they are trying to bully her into testifying against her versus Kavanaugh as opposed to calling all of the witnesses who have important understanding and knowledge of the events. Even to have Mark Judge, who was in the room, to not be forced to be investigated by the FBI to answer questions under oath and testify under oath is a dereliction of their duty.îShe added, ìI have heard my Republican colleagues say that we have to vote now. That is outrageous, and we intend to be here through all of October, and we have time to do this thoughtfully, and to do it precisely and to be fair to this witness, and what they are doing today is nothing short than shameful.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/19/christine-blasey-ford-might-refuse-brett-kavanaugh-testimony-without-fbi-investigation/,"WASHINGTON, DC ñ Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford and her attorney, Debra Katz, demand that the FBI investigate before Ford will speak to senators, which the FBI will not do because it has no jurisdiction, setting the stage for Ford to back out. Republicans are becoming skeptical, with one commenting, ìIt is almost as if the accuser does not want to state her accusations under oath.îRepublicans treated the allegations against President Trumpís Supreme Court nominee seriously, suspending their planned Senate Judiciary Committee vote on his nomination to investigate the matter fully, including setting a time on Monday for both the judge and the woman who accused him of misconduct in 1982 ñ when he was a teenager ñ to provide sworn testimony to senators.Fordís attorney Katz suggested that senators had planned to put Kavanaugh and Ford side-by-side at the same table to testify and rejected that idea as traumatizing to Ford, forcing her to relive the alleged incident.ìContrary to suggestions by Dr. Fordís attorneys, the committee had no plans to place Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh on a panel together, and never indicated plans to do so,î the Senate Judiciary Committee responded in a statement. ìGrassleyís staff offered Dr. Ford multiple dates as well as a choice of providing information in a public or private setting.îNow Katz says that Ford has a new condition before testifying: The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) must investigate this matter first; then Ford would testify afterward.That is a non-starter, the FBI responded. It is a federal law enforcement agency and, therefore, has jurisdiction to investigate only federal crimes. The conduct Ford describes ñ personal sexual misconduct, whether groping or the more serious crime of attempted rape ñ are crimes under state law, not federal law, and, thus, are properly referred to county prosecutors and local police departments, not to the FBI.ìIt is important to remember that an FBI background investigation is entirely different from an FBI criminal investigation,î a former federal prosecutor told Breitbart News. ìThe letter referred by Feinstein has already been added to Kavanaughís file, so the normal background element is complete.îìWhat Ford is now asking for with a full investigation would be a criminal investigation,î the prosecutor continued. ìThe FBI does not do that when there is no federal crime being alleged.îAnother source explains that the purpose of an FBI background investigation is to allow people to provide information in a strictly confidential manner, including secret accusations. Because Ford is making her accusations publicly, there is no role whatsoever for the FBI to play in collecting anonymous or confidential information.The only way the FBI would get involved is if President Trump took the extraordinary action of ordering the FBI to do so. But that creates a no-win situation because then the presidentís opponents who are currently attacking Kavanaugh could accuse the White House of political interference with a law enforcement investigation, directing an agency to act outside its jurisdiction. Some could even call a presidential order for the FBI to investigate a state-law matter to be an abuse of power.Several federal agencies are ìbuzz wordsî in American society, whose very name carries a ìJack Bauerî connotation of serious federal action. Those agencies include the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the U.S. Secret Service, and the FBI.Saying the FBI is investigating a matter lends immediate gravitas to the situation and, with it, adds political weight to the accusation. Some people are beginning to wonder if Katz or Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) wants the political headline of saying the FBI is investigating Kavanaugh, fully aware that there is nothing for the FBI to investigate within its law enforcement mission.It would also be very difficult to investigate this allegation in any event, as U.S. attorney Joe diGenova said on Fox News on Tuesday, as Ford is now saying she cannot be sure when the event happened, where it happened, or who else was present. The only other individual she named as being present ñ journalist Mark Judge ñ has publicly stated he never saw such a thing, emphatically denying the allegation.ìRepublicans are bending over backwards to defer to the politically powerful #MeToo movement,î Fox Newsís Britt Hume ñ one of the most seasoned political veterans in journalism ñ said on-air Tuesday night.But despite Republicans doing so, some observers believe Ford and Katz are now moving the goalposts in a direction that would delay Kavanaughís joining the Supreme Court†while rejecting the opportunity offered by senators to provide testimony that could get to the bottom of the situation.Senate Republicans are beginning to ask new questions regarding the allegations now that their repeated attempts to get Ford to give sworn testimony are being rejected unless the FBI first takes actions that are outside the agencyís lawful mandate.ìIíve said from the beginning that these are very serious allegations, and she deserves to be heard,î said Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), a moderate Republican who is a crucial swing vote for Kavanaughís confirmation. ìI really hope she doesnít pass up that opportunityî:Sen.

On two occasions, through the Department of Justice, and independent of Trump, the FBI accurately pointed out that their agency does not investigate local sexual misconduct allegations, especially ones that happened 36 years ago when both parties were still teenagers in high school.The worst part of Cillizzaís lie, though, is that if you look at Trump ës precise words, he actually said he would support the FBI had they decided to get involved ó which is the exact opposite of ìtelling the FBI to ignoreî the matter.ìI donít think the FBI really should be involved because they donít want to be involved,î Trump said, adding, ìif they wanted to be I would certainly do that, but as you know they say this is not really their thing.îhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=456&v=CYqtaFaTZhQCillizza is deliberately lying; deliberately deceiving the public with fake news.Kavanaughís accuser, Christine Blasey Ford,says she cannot remember where or when the alleged misconduct took place. Whatís more, she named two other people who were supposedly at this house party, and both of them†(Mark Judge and Patrick Smyth ó who believes he is the second person) have released statements saying it never happened.As of now, Ford is†refusing to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath in either a private or public session. Ford is now demanding a full FBI investigation first.Ford had said she wanted to tell her story, but she is now aligning herself with Democrats who appear to be using the demand for an FBI investigation that is not going to happen as a means to stall the vote on Kavanaughís nomination until after the midterms. If Democrats take back the Senate next year, they will kill Kavanaughís nomination and anyone else Trump were to nominate in his place.You can read the details of Cillizzaís previous lies here and here. Cillizza also published a gif that put President Trump in crosshairs.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/18/third-person-that-kavanaugh-accuser-claims-was-at-party-denies-incident/,"A third high school student Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford claimed attended a party more than 35 years ago where the future Judge Kavanaugh attacked her denied any memory of the alleged incident†in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, CNN reported Tuesday.CNN obtained a letter from†Patrick J. Smyth, a†Georgetown Prep alum who graduated in Kavanaughís class, to Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). The letter was penned after Ford apparently identified Smyth as ìPJî ñ another teenager who was one of around five people at a drunken gathering in a Montgomery County, Maryland, home in or around 1982.ìI understand that I have been identified by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as the person she remembers as ëPJí who supposedly was present at the party she described in her statements to the Washington Post,î the letter, penned by Smythís attorney,†Eric Bruce, reads. ìI am issuing this statement today to make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh.îSmyth remains Kavanaughís friend and had already written to the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of his nomination to the Supreme Court, calling him ìsingularly qualified to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Courtî in a letter co-authored by Georgetown Prep classmates of Kavanaugh.ìPersonally speaking, I have known Brett Kavanaugh since high school and I know him to be a person of great integrity, a great friend, and I have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women,î Smythís new letter continues.ìTo safeguard my own privacy and anonymity, I respectfully request that the Committee accept this statement in response to any inquiry the Committee may have,î the letter explains, although, with the letterís leaking to CNN, that anonymity is apparently at an end.The denial is the third of the among five people Ford has claimed were present when Kavanaugh and classmate Mark Judge, both allegedly drunk, forced her into a room where Kavanaugh forced himself on top of Ford and groped her until she managed to escape without incident. Kavanaugh and Judge have both categorically denied any recollection of the incident or the high school party itself.The exact number of attendees ñ like the date, location, and circumstances of the supposed party ñ has never been definitively fixed in any of Fordís accounts. Some accounts include the attendance of a still not publicly identified female.Ford, by her own account, told no one of the incident for three decades, revealing it only at a marriage counseling session in 2012. In July, she sent Feinstein a letter realleging the attack, but the ranking Democrat made no mention of it throughout Kavanaughís confirmation hearings, going public only after news reports of the letter began to emerge over the weekend.Republicans set a Monday date for a hearing under oath on the matter, which Kavanaugh has agreed to attend. Ford, despite her attorney, Debra Katzís, repeated assertions she is willing to testify, has not yet accepted her invitation to do so. After reports of her failure to accept the invitation emerged Tuesday, Katz returned to the airwaves to claim Ford will not appear until the FBI investigates her claims.The FBI has repeatedly denied it is conducting an investigation, noting there is no potential federal crime contained in Fordís allegations. A Monday Department of Justice statement made clear this is not a type of investigation the FBI performs as part of its background investigations.†ìThe FBI does not make any judgment about the credibility or significance of any allegation.†The purpose of a background investigation is to determine whether the nominee could pose a risk to the national security of the United States,î the statement explained.ìOn the night of September 12, the FBI received a letter dated from July 2018 alleging that the nominee engaged in an incident of misconduct in the 1980s,î the statement continues. ìConsistent with the memorandum of understanding, the FBI forwarded this letter to the White House Counselís Office. The allegation does not involve any potential federal crime.†The FBIís role in such matters is to provide information for the use of the decision makers.îWhile Chairman Grassley has made clear Mondayís hearing may be cancelled if Ford refuses to testify, Democrats echoed Katzís demands for the FBI to get involved. One member of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Mazie Hirono, did so while further instructing ìthe men in this countryî to ìjust shut up and step up.î

Because they only want a he said/she said scenario. In fact, they should be allowing the FBI to do a complete background check now that they have this allegation, which has not been done, which is the normal course for any Supreme Court nominee.îShe later said of Kavanaugh, ìI donít think heís qualified because of his record on womenís issues, specifically. He doesnít believe that women should have the ability to make decisions about their reproductive freedom. He believes that your boss should decide whether or not you have access to birth control. And if he has this history, then he is unfit for the court, and he doesnít have the character or integrity.îGillibrand concluded by stating of Ford, ìI believe her. Her story is credible. If you listen to everything about it, the fact that she told her therapist about it five years ago, a friend most recently, she told a reporter before Kavanaugh was even named to be a nominee. This is a woman who has endured trauma, and ó as experts have said, this is what trauma looks like. These ó it gets relived much later in time.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/18/kavanaugh-accusers-lawyer-defended-clinton-franken/,"Debra Katz, the†attorney hired by Christine Blasey Ford to represent her and her claim that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh attacked her at a high school party three decades ago, is a longtime Democratic activist and donor. Katz has, in the past, defended men accused of sexual assault by multiple women, including former President Bill Clinton and disgraced former U.S. Senator Al Franken (D-MN).And she is a part of the ìresistî movement, the anti-President Donald Trump crowd. In an October 2017 interview posted on the National Women Law Centerís website, Katz was asked about sexual misconduct cases.ìToday, in your practice, have you noticed an increase in these kinds of cases or complaints? Why do you think that is?î Emily Martin, vice president for Education and Workplace Justice, asked Katz in 2017.ìUnfortunately, these kinds of cases do not go away. In times of economic uncertainty when people feel vulnerable on many levels, it is easy for them to blame other ëoutsideí groups, including women, African-Americans, and national origin minorities, for their lost opportunities,î Katz said. ìPart of President Trumpís appeal is apparently that he reinforces those fears and resentments.î†ìWe are seeing a large uptick in sexual, racial, and religious harassment cases since the election,î Katz said. ìUnfortunately, President Trumpís misogynistic, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim conduct and comments have radically lowered the bar and have normalized abusive and assaultive conduct in the workplace.îHowever, when asked about men who have been accused of sexual assault by numerous women ó Clinton who was impeached and Franken who resigned ó Katz has defended them.In Clintonís case, Katz took his word over that of Paula Jones, who claimed that the president exposed himself and pressured her to commit a sexual act, according to a report in Townhall:Katz dismissed Jonesí assertions on March 30th, 1998 on CNNís ìTalkback Liveî saying that, ìPaula Jonesí suit is very, very, very weak. Sheís alleged one incident that took place in a hotel room that, by her own testimony, lasted 10 to 12 minutes. She suffered no repercussions in the workplace.îLikewise, Katz again said on CBSí Evening News on April 2nd, 1998 that Jonesí allegation could not hold up in court because, ìClearly a one-time incident that took place in 10 to 12 minutes, she was not forced to have sex, she left on her own volition, the courts increasingly are finding that that is not enough to create a sexually hostile work environment claim.îÖIn 1998, Katz told the media that, ìIf a woman came to me with a similar fact pattern, that is someone in the company above her propositioned her but only once and she suffered no tangible job detriment. I would probably tell her that Iím sorry, itís unfair, but you donít have a case.í Katz said that courts have generally held that a one-time proposition does not constitute harassment. If itís one time, it has to be severe, almost a sexual assault, not just a touching of somebodyís breast or buttocks or even forceful kissing.îKatz also defended Franken when several women accused him of sexual misconduct.ìContext is relevant,î Katz said of the scandal. ìHe did not do this as a member of the U.S. Senate. He did this in his capacity of someone who was still functioning as an entertainer.îKatz has also been a longtime financial supporter of Democrats, according to Open Secrets. She donated more than $8,000 to both former President Barack Obamaís presidential campaigns.At an event to raise money for Hillary Clintonís presidential campaign in 2015, Katz is credited with raising $29,000.She also has ties to George Soros, according to the Washington Times, through her involvement with the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), an organization that has been directly funded by Sorosís Open Society Foundation.POGO co-signed a letter to Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) with a variety of leftist groups demanding Kavanaugh records, according to FrontPageMag.Follow Penny Starr on Twitter.

During the confirmation hearings, Harris continued to try to grab the spotlight with her antics, which the Los Angeles Times even conceded ìfailed miserably.îHarris, who often sounds like a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, was also condemned when she shared an edited video clip of Kavanaugh during the confirmation hearings to make it seem like Kavanaugh told Senators that he viewed contraceptives as ìabortion-inducing drugs.î

But I donít want want to get in front of the chairman.îSen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), the Judiciary Committeeís ranking member, accused Republicans of trying to ìrushî the nomination and called for more witnesses to be called on Monday even as she waffled on whether ìeverything is truthfulî about Fordís accusations.ìChairman Grassley today said there would be only two witnesses invited to testify at the Kavanaugh hearing next week on sexual assault allegations.

What about individuals who were previously told about this incident? What about experts who can speak to the effects of this kind of trauma on a victim? This is another attempt by Republicans to rush this nomination and not fully vet Judge Kavanaugh.îPolitical operatives from both parties†told the Washington Post that female voters could turn out for Democrats like they did in 1992 after the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill hearings ìif Republicans mishandle the investigation of Fordís allegations.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/18/prager-the-charges-against-judge-kavanaugh-should-be-ignored/,"Dennis Prager writes in Townhall that judging Brett Kavanaugh on the basis of an unsubstantiated accusation about his behavior while in high school is indicative of the irrationality and lack of moral compass in our society:It is almost impossible to overstate the damage done to Americaís moral compass by taking the charges leveled against Judge Brett Kavanaugh seriously.It undermines foundational moral principles of any decent society.Those who claim the charges against Judge Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford are important and worth investigating, and that they ultimately, if believed, invalidate his candidacy for the U.S. Supreme Court are stating that:a) What a middle-aged adult did in high school is all we need to know to evaluate an individualís character ó even when his entire adult life has been impeccable.b) No matter how good and moral a life one has led for 10, 20, 30, 40 or even 50 years, it is nullified by a sin committed as a teenager.No decent ó or rational ó society has ever believed such nihilistic nonsense.Read the rest of the column here.

Some become vicious. If you have lost friends, since Trump got elected or have been yelled at over dinner or on an airplane, you know exactly what we are talking about. Liberals believe they were meant to run this country, our government and our culture. They have no intention of sharing control with you. If they are not in charge, they will burn it down, which is what they are doing now.îìThe question is ó the political question is will the Republican Party let them do this? If Republicans allow Kavanaughís nomination to be derailed over an unprovable allegation he canít rebut, itís over. They will never put a justice on the Supreme Court again. It will be too easy to stop them. A single charge from 35 years ago will be enough. Thatís the precedent they would set.† And let us pause parenthetically and say, we may learn more in the coming weeks, who knows and the calculation may change. But as of today, there is no way to prove either way what happened 35 years ago in Bethesda, Maryland. Itís an unsolvable mystery,†again unless something else comes up. So to derail the nomination on the basis of it, would be a brand-new thing. Republican voters put up with a lot already including a party leadership that does not share their values, or even like them very much and doesnít hide it well.

According to Ford,†Mike Judge, a friend of†Kavanaugh, pounced†on the two, sending them†both tumbling, prompting her to flee the room.Kavanaugh denied the allegation Monday, issuing the following statement:†ìThis is a completely false allegation. I have never done anything like what the accuser describesóto her or to anyone. Because this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday. îSpeaking before reporters Monday, President Donald Trump expressed confidence in the Senate Judiciary Committeeís ability to vote†Kavanaugh through and praised the nominee as†ìone of the finest people that Iíve ever known.îìHeís an outstanding intellect, an outstanding judge, respected by everybody.

It shouldnít, certainly, be very much.îìIt will, Iím sure, work out very well,î the president added.

The accusation, known to†Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) for more than six weeks but kept private until after the end of the scheduled hearings on Kavanaughís nomination, has thrown an already chaotic confirmation process even further afield of the norm.Earlier Monday, sources close to the confirmation process were confident Thursdayís scheduled final committee vote would still take place. But that vote is now unlikely to take place until at least next Tuesday.The reports emerged shortly after Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) told reporters she would need to see both Ford and Kavanaugh tesitfy under oath on the matter before she cast her vote.The news of a Monday hearing took even staffers close to Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassleyís (R-IA) office by surprise. Even after talk of a hearing flowed, Kavanaugh, who categorically denies Fordís accusation, had indicted he was willing to testify under oath as soon as Tuesday this week.Grassley himself confirmed the reports in a statement shortly therefore, setting 10:00 a.m. as the hearing start and indicating the hearing was decided on after Senate Democrats refused to participate in a Monday evening conference call with Kavanaugh on the matter.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman @ChuckGrassley today announced that the Committee will hold a public hearing with Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. pic.twitter.com/523miClAVLó Senate Judiciary (@senjudiciary) September 17, 2018

The Democrat-connected accuser specifically stated that there was no nudity involved in the alleged incident and that both parties were fully clothed.According to the claims made by accuser Christine Blasey Ford, Kavanaugh ìgroped her over her clothes.î So, unlike Carreyís drawing, there was no nudity in her accusations.Meanwhile, Judge Kavanaugh fully denies all of the allegations being thrown at him, saying that the claims are ìcompletely false.îìI have never done anything like what the accuser describesóto her or to anyone,î Kavanaugh added. ìBecause this never happened, I had no idea who was making this accusation until she identified herself yesterday.îInconsistencies have also appeared in Fordís accusations. For instance, she cannot recall exactly when this alleged ìgropingî occurred but thinks it was sometime in 1982. She is also not sure exactly where it happened. Further, Ford has revised just who was in the room when she claims the incident took place.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/17/senate-republicans-stick-with-thursday-kavanaugh-committee-vote/,"The Senate Judiciary Committee will proceed to a planned vote on Supreme Court Nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh Thursday, sources tell Breitbart News Monday.Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) is, according to these sources, refusing to yield to pressure over allegations of a high school attack revealed by Democrats over the weekend. Since July, Ranking Member Diane Feinstein (D-CA) had possession of a letter from California professor Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, claiming that Kavanaugh and another teenager had forced her into a room at a 1982 party where Kavanaugh forced himself on her before she escaped.Feinstein declined to introduce the letter at any point before or during the four-day public hearings on Kavanaughís nomination, but went public after media reports of the letter began to surface.The Republican leadership came under intense pressure not only from Senate Democrats, but from moderate Republicans like Sens. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), who indicated they would not vote for Kavanaugh without hearing Fordís accusations out. Democrats like Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) explicitly took this as support for his call to delay the vote.Two sources close to the confirmation process, however, told Breitbart News that Republicans will not yield to that pressure. One claimed the Thursday vote would occur ìno matter what.î The other confirmed that Chairman Grassley remains ìcompletely committedî to the originally scheduled Thursday vote.Both sources also indicated Judge Kavanaugh will speak on a conference call with the Senate Judiciary Committee Monday night, where he will directly address Fordís accusations. He has already twice categorically denied he attacked Ford and reports indicate he told Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) Monday that he was not at the party in question.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) also addressed the matter on the Senate floor Monday afternoon.ìI am glad that Chairman Grassley is following standard practice and regular order. As heís stated, he plans to pursue this matter by the book, with bipartisan interviews of both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Ford,î he said, criticizing Grassleyís Democratic counterpart, Sen. Feinstein, over her handling of the matter:Neither she nor any of her Democratic colleagues chose to raise this allegation during the committee staffís bipartisan background calls with the nominee. They did not raise it, even with the name redacted, in the 65 meetings Judge Kavanaugh held with Senators before his confirmation hearings, including his private meeting with the Ranking Member. They did not raise it, even with the name redacted, in four days of exhaustive public hearings while Judge Kavanaugh testified under oath ó even though they chose to raise myriad other matters at the hearing, including through sometimes bizarre innuendo.They did not raise it in the closed session, the proper forum where such an allegation could been addressed with discretion and sensitivity. They did not raise it in the thousand-plus follow-up questions that Senators sent to Judge Kavanaugh in writing. But now ñ at the 11th hour, with committee votes on the schedule, after Democrats have spent weeks and weeks searching for any possible reason that the nomination should be delayed.Minority Leader Schumer spoke shortly thereafter, reiterating his call for a delay on Thursdayís vote and an open hearing before the Judiciary Committee. ìWhen someone Ö believes she was terribly aggrieved ó and I believe her ó Ö when the credibility of a Supreme Court Justice is on the line, weíre gonna just brush it under the rug?î he asked, adding, ìI want to applaud my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have called for hearings. I believe, one way or another, six have said this should be delayed. I hope theyíll be strong. I hope they tell Leader McConnell heís doing the wrong thing.îWhile some Senate Republicans, like Flake, Graham, and Bob Corker (R-TN) have said Ford must have an opportunity to be heard, and key moderate vote Sen. Susan Collins said†Monday she wants both Ford and Kavanaugh to testify under oath, none have explicitly ruled out a Thursday vote.Asked about the situation Monday, President Donald Trump stuck by his pick, calling the idea of him withdrawing ìridiculous.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/17/senate-judiciary-committee-suspicious-timing-of-feinstein-attack-on-kavanaugh/,"Senate Judiciary Committee Republicans are questioning why Dianne Feinstein waited two months to act on Christine Blasey Fordís allegations of Judge Brett Kavanaugh groping her in 1982†when Kavanaugh was a high-school teenager.It would be more politically impactful to confront him on national television during his confirmation hearings ó unless she thought the accusations would not survive serious scrutiny.Feinstein is a smart, tough, experienced senator, but she did not take the shot. Why?Serious accusations should not be ignored, as the White House has said. Everyone should agree that every human being deserves to be heard respectfully when they say that something bad has happened to them, and people who have honestly suffered must be comforted and cared for. However, the sad reality is that sometimes the accusations are not true, and false accusations can destroy a good personís reputation and career.Imagine this scenario: It is Wednesday, September 5, the second day of the nationally televised Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. Every news organization in the country is tuned in as senators begin grilling President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court nominee with questions, which he must answer under oath, on camera.Chairman Chuck Grassley goes first. Second is Feinstein as the ranking member of the minority. No one has changed the channel yet; it is still the opening part of the hearing.ìJudge, I have a letter in my hand from a woman accusing you of sexual misconduct,î Feinstein could have begun. ìAnd I am going to take all 30 minutes of my time with you today asking you about this on national television. I remind you that you are under oath.îMany of her colleagues would doubtless have asked some follow-up questions during their turns during the next 12 hours. His answers would have led to more questions, and the Senate Democrats with prosecutorial backgrounds, like Pat Leahy (D-VT), Richard Blumenthal (R-CT), and Kamala Harris (D-CA) could have gone into full attack mode.Whatever they forgot to ask during the first day of questions would have been asked during the second day.Kavanaugh would have been under oath. Every word he said would subject him to prosecution for perjury if he lied. It could have been a catastrophe for him ó if Feinstein believed the allegations were true.Democrats would have been protected by legislative immunity. Under the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution, because this took place in a committee hearing, Feinstein ó as well as the less temperate members of her caucus (e.g., ìSpartacusî or Harris) ó could have said anything they wanted. They could have declared that he was guilty of committing a felony. They would be immune from lawsuits for defamation, including future subpoenas or depositions.Feinsteinís ambush would have been breaking news. It would have been explosive. It would have captivated the nation. In fact, it would have made history.So Republicans are asking, why did Feinstein not do it?She did not need time to vet the story. This was not an accuser who saw the hearings in September and decided at the last minute to call the Senate. Instead, Feinstein learned all this in July. She has all the time in the world to vet the story, investigate the accuser, corroborate the charges, and to decide the best angle of attack.Instead, Feinstein waited until after the hearings ó after the cameras were gone, and Kavanaugh was no longer under oath. She waited until the White House and Senate Republicans would have time to craft responses as a team to give coordinated responses.If she had thought these allegations amounted to a smoking gun, senior Repubicans are thinking there was no reason in the world not to seize control of the hearings while the national cameras were rolling and possibly destroy the nomination.ìItís disturbing that these uncorroborated allegations from more than 35 years ago, during high school, would surface on the eve of a committee vote after Democrats sat on them since July,î said Taylor Foy for the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chairman, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA). ìIf Ranking Member Feinstein and other Committee Democrats took this claim seriously, they should have brought it to the full Committeeís attention much earlier.îThe committeeís spokesman continued:Instead, they said nothing during two joint phone calls with the nominee in August, four days of lengthy public hearings, a closed session for all committee members with the nominee where sensitive topics can be discussed and in more than 1,300 written questions.ìI agree with the concerns expressed in the Judiciary Committeeís statement about the substance and process regarding the allegations in this latest claim against Judge Kavanaugh,î said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC). He added that he wanted to see the committee vote on the nomination on Thursday in any event, and so anything further the committee might require ìshould be done immediately so the process can continue as scheduled.îConsider next how Feinstein acted after she first heard of the accusations, according to the story that has been told publicly.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) gave a closed-door briefing to senators regarding their comprehensive investigation into Kavanaugh. Feinstein reportedly blew it off; she did not even attend, according to sources who spoke with Breitbart News.Feinsteinís office has not responded to our requests for comment at the time the story was filed.Feinstein did not tell her colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee about the accusations. She could have set up a coordinated campaign with them. The word on Capitol Hill is that Democratic senators are not happy that she did not share her information with them.She did not raise it in private meetings. She did not raise it in a private session, where senators could have asked questions with no cameras to provide a more candid exchange. She also did not raise it in the questionnaire they sent Kavanaugh after the hearing, to which he provided over 100 pages in answers and 17,000 pages in attachments.They could have brought her in as a witness on Friday, September 7, to tell her account to the nation. But even if she was not willing to go before national television cameras, Feinstein could have made her case during all the other days of the televised hearings.One inside expert who spoke with Breitbart News said the only plausible explanation was that Feinstein did not think Fordís accusation would hold up under scrutiny. Otherwise, why not raise what would have been a smoking gun if it were true?ìJudge Kavanaugh is admired in his church, in his community, and in his profession,î said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network (JCN). ìThroughout his distinguished career in public service, he has undergone half a dozen FBI background checks, and never a whisper of misconduct.†Until the eve of his confirmation.îìSixty-five women who were his contemporaries during high school have all come out saying that Brett Kavanaugh was and is a man of character and integrity,î she continued. ìCountless women who have known Brett Kavanaugh personally and professionally spanning three decades have all testified to his respect for women, his character, and his integrity.îìFurthermore, Senator Feinstein apparently did not believe the allegations were serious, credible, or relevant enough to share with the FBI or any other member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, even in the confidential background portion of the committee process,î Severino added. ìIt doesnít add up. But what does add up is that Democrats are doubling down on a strategy of character assassination, seeking to destroy the life of a distinguished public servant for the sake of appeasing their base.îKen Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News.

In a statement, Feinstein said Sunday that ìfrom the outsetî she had believed the accusations were ìextremely serious.î Yet she did not bring them up in his confirmation hearing earlier this month.Fellow Democrat Mazie Hirono (D-HI) did, however, ask Kavanaugh on Sep. 5 about whether he had ever faced allegations of sexual misconduct as ìa legal adult,î noting that she asks that of every judicial nominee. He said he never had:Sen. Hirono: Since you became a legal adult, have you ever made unwanted requests for sexual requests for sexual favors, or committed any verbal or physical harassment or assault of a sexual nature?Judge Kavanaugh: No.Sen. Hirono: Have you ever faced discipline or entered into a settlement related to this kind of conduct?Judge Kavanaugh:†No.Kavanaugh went on to say, ìNo woman should be subjected to sexual harassment in the workplace,î as Hirono questioned him about allegations against former Judge Alex Kozinski, the Ninth Circuit judge for whom he once clerked.Kavanaugh added that he had ìno reason not to believeî the women who had come forward to accuse Kozinski of inappropriate behavior. He also agreed ìcompletelyî with Hirono that ìwomen who are the victims of sexual harassmentî needed better support.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

The records mention that she was attacked by students from ìan elitist boysí schoolî who went on to become ìhighly respected and high-ranking members of society in Washington.î The notes claim that there were four boys involved, instead of just Ford and Kavanaugh. However, Ford claims that is an error on the therapistís part. The accuser says that there were four boys at the party, but only Ford and Kavanaugh in the room.Ford is represented by Debra Katz, a liberal Democrat activist lawyer who has publicly touted that she is part of ìthe Resistanceî to President Trump and his agenda. Ford has also donated to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) 2016 presidential campaign.Judge declined to comment regarding the Postís story on Sunday.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/16/dem-sen-kamala-harris-i-have-concerns-about-kavanaughs-dog-whistling/,"Sunday on MSNBCís ìPoliticsNation,î†Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)†said she had concerns about President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaughís ìdog-whistlingîHarris said, ìI strongly believe that based on every type of work he has done that his óthe issue with him is not only that heís a political ideologue. Itís not about only his beliefs, itís about the fact that heís been an operative, a political operative. And so you look at that on a number of issues. For example, I brought up dog whistling. And you know dog whistling is a term for basically people who are speaking in code to touch certain people who recognize the language as being representative of how they think.îShe continued, ìFor example, he used the term in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece that he wrote ó now this is a lawyer who is a judge who talks about how he uses his words very carefullyó twice in a published opinion he used the word racial spoil system. One of the witnesses during the hearing was the Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus Cedric Richmond. I asked him when he was a witness, ëwhat does that term mean?í And he said thatís a dog whistle. That speaks to people who believe because this was the question I asked Kavanaugh when he was before us. That speaks to the belief that somebody is taking something from them that nobody else should have. So thatís the term that has been used when people talk about affirmative action or when people talk about how we have looked at the disadvantage and the historical disadvantage the government has created for minorities and particularly black people. and he uses the word racial spoils systems.îShe added, ìHe used the word abortion on demand. There are specific cases that óone in particular, the Garza case, where there was a young woman, immigrant woman, 17 years old who went through every step that the law required her to go through to obtain an abortion. And yet he called it abortion on demand because those who would deprive women of their ability to make decisions about their own body are trying to suggest itís just like tv on demand. You just click a button and you get it, which is mislead, and it is wrong. So those are the concerns I have.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/16/tillis-why-on-earth-were-allegation-against-kavanaugh-not-discussed-earlier/,"Sunday on CBSís ìFace the Nation,î Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) questioned why a letter that alleges sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is just now surfacing considering†Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA) obtained the letter in July.Partial transcript as follows: JOHN DICKERSON: Senator when you get back to Washington you got a vote on Tuesday and the Judiciary Committee which you sit on. Thereís been some information about sexual misconduct allegations against Brett Kavanaugh the presidentís nominee. Have you looked at the letter that is now a part of his file? Itís a itís. Have you looked at that.THOM TILLIS: I havenít seen the letter. As a matter of fact, I believe that the member that first received the letter was as late as July. And quite honestly Iím shocked that the matter didnít come up in the nearly 32 hours of testimony that Judge Kavanaugh was before as in the open session or the nearly hour hour and a half session that we had in a closed session. That information never came up. So when we get back to Washington this week weíll take a look at it but it really raises a question in my mind about, if this was material to the confirmation process, why on Earth, over the past four to six weeks, hasnít it been discussed among the committee members?DICKERSON: Thatís right and we should make it quite clear this is something heís denied categorically. This is something that allegedly happened much more than 30 years ago. But now that it is in the mix, is your is your feeling that this is a ploy of some kind or that this is while it is so long ago sufficient sufficiently important to look at look seriously and put into your calculation and others as they make their vote.TILLIS: Well Iíve Iíve spent most of my time focused on Hurricane Florence, but the questions that we will ask and seek answers to next week are, ìwhy sit on it for weeks?î We understand that the person who wrote the letter is not willing to come forward. So we have a confidential witness not willing to sit down at least in a closed setting thatís problematic to me. And as you said Judge Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegations and I put some weight on that.DICKERSON: Very quickly Senator you think heíll be confirmed by the Senate?TILLIS: Oh I do-DICKERSON: -Alright-TILLIS: -I think that weíll move forward to report about the committee and confirm him before October.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/09/15/leahy-kavanaughs-candor-and-character-in-question-views-on-constitution-downright-extreme/,"During Fridayís Democratic Weekly Address, Senate Judiciary Committee member Pat Leahy (D-VT) stated Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaughís ìcandor ñ and therefore his character ñ is seriously in question. And his constitutional views are downright extreme.îTranscript as Follows:ìThe American people just witnessed an unprecedented week of Supreme Court hearings for President Trumpís nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Now I have been in the Senate for 44 years, thatís a time that includes 19 nominations to the Supreme Court ó more than any other sitting Senator. And I do not use the word unprecedented lightly. Unfortunately, it was unprecedented for all the wrong reasons.This was the least transparent confirmation process Iíve ever seen. Senate Republicans blocked the American people from seeing more than 93 percent, thatís 93 percent, of Judge Kavanaughís record during his five controversial years in the Bush White House. Of the small fraction weíve seen, Republicans, without justification, have kept us from sharing nearly 190,000 pages with the American people. And then on top of that, President Trump asserted executive privilege to hide an additional 102,000 pages from the Senate and the American people ñ that is unprecedented. And the White House hasnít even released a privilege log so we donít even know what theyíre withholding. Reasonable Americans watching this should wonder: What are they hiding?Judge Kavanaughís conception of the Constitution itself is deeply troubling; his lack of candor during the hearing only exacerbated my concerns. The documents that Senate Republicans have been withholding from the American people could help cast significant light on what we already know about Judge Kavanaughís troubling legal views. As a judge, for example, he has argued that all regulations on guns are effectively unconstitutional, unless they were in effect when the Constitution was drafted. Of course at that time, that was an age of muskets, not military-style assault weapons favored by mass shooters today. And as a White House staffer, Judge Kavanaugh coached controversial conservative nominees, coached them to provide vague, meaningless assurances to the Senate regarding Roe v. Wade. Well, last week, he followed his own blueprint; he dodged questions about whether the Constitution protects a womanís right to reproductive care. The same week that a federal court was hearing oral arguments in a case that would erode vital health care protections, Judge Kavanaugh dodged a question on whether he would promise to uphold pre-existing condition protections as constitutional by saying he couldnít ëgive assurances on a specific hypothetical.íAnd, you know, of unique interest to a President who is increasingly fixated on his own legal jeopardy and problems, Judge Kavanaugh has taken the unorthodox position that Presidents should not be burdened with either criminal or civil investigations while in office. Perhaps knowing that President Trump would be watching last week, Judge Kavanaugh artfully avoided providing any real answers than would walk back his unbridled views on executive immunity and power.I have never been more concerned about a Supreme Court nomineeís basic willingness and unwillingness to be truthful under oath. Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly testified that during his time in the Bush White House, he never had reason to believe he was benefiting from information that had been stolen from Democrats. But he repeatedly received information clearly marked ëhighly confidentialí and even one e-mail with the subject: ëspyingí, this from a Republican aide behind one of the biggest thefts in Senate history. A scandal in which Republican aides on the Senate Judiciary Committee stole 4,670 files from six Democratic senators, including myself. Documents show that his testimony was almost certainly false.Now Judge Kavanaugh also testified that he was never personally involved in the highly controversial nomination of Judge William Pryor, who called Roe v. Wade a constitutional ëabomination.í Well, the documents show that too was false. And Judge Kavanaugh testified that he had ëheard nothing at allí related to the NSAís warrantless wiretapping program of Americans until the press exposed it, and he said he never worked on policies related to detainees. Again, documents strongly suggest that this testimony was clearly misleading. You know, candor speaks to a personís character. And nothing is more important than character than when that individual seeks to shape Americansí lives for a generation or more with the mere stroke of a pen.With so much at stake, Americans are right to be deeply concerned about this nomination. The confirmation process has been woefully inadequate. Republicans have abandoned basic standards of transparency well-established by our committee. They treated last weekís hearings more like a coronation than a constitutionally-mandated vetting. Judge Kavanaughís candor ñ and therefore his character ñ is seriously in question. And his constitutional views are downright extreme.Like we did last week, Senate Democrats will continue to make our voices heard during this confirmation. And we count on Americans to do the same. We need to speak up, before it is too late, to defend the integrity of our nationís highest court. Only nominees of unquestioned character and forthright candor should sit on the Supreme Court, and Judge Kavanaugh threw both into question during last weekís hearing.We must protect womenís constitutional rights, vulnerable individuals with pre-existing conditions, protect the rule of law from a president who acts like heís above it, and the hard-fought rights of millions of hard-working Americans. With so much on the line, remaining on the sidelines is simply not an option. Democracy, especially in moments like these, is not a spectator sport.îFollow Ian†Hanchett on Twitter†@IanHanchett

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/14/ronan-farrow-reports-kavanaugh-accuser-refuses-to-come-forward-no-witnesses/,"On the eve of a vote on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh as a justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, Sen. Dianne Feinstein has produced a letter from an unnamed woman who accuses him of sexual misconduct when she and Kavanaugh were in high school.Ronan Farrow ó a journalist who has gained notoriety for his investigative reporting on sexual predators, including disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and CBS executive Leslie Moonves ó worked with another writer at the New Yorker to report on the last-ditch effort by Democrats to derail Kavanaughís confirmation.Unlike Farrowís earlier reports on Weinstein and Moonves ñ in which victims are named and interviews included in the piece, the Kavanaugh accuser is different ó and less credible ó for several reasons.First, the woman is refusing to provide her name or to be interviewed ó even anonymously.Second, she did not tell anyone at the time of the alleged encounter with Kavanaugh, while Kavanaugh was with a friend during their interaction and said he doesnít recall the story she tells.The New Yorker reported:The woman, who has asked not to be identified, first approached Democratic lawmakers in July, shortly after Trump nominated Kavanaugh. The allegation dates back to the early nineteen-eighties, when Kavanaugh was a high-school student at Georgetown Preparatory School, in Bethesda, Maryland, and the woman attended a nearby high school. In the letter, the woman alleged that, during an encounter at a party, Kavanaugh held her down, and that he attempted to force himself on her. She claimed in the letter that Kavanaugh and a classmate of his, both of whom had been drinking, turned up music that was playing in the room to conceal the sound of her protests, and that Kavanaugh covered her mouth with his hand. She was able to free herself. Although the alleged incident took place decades ago and the three individuals involved were minors, the woman said that the memory had been a source of ongoing distress for her, and that she had sought psychological treatment as a result.Kavanaugh has issued a statement, which the New Yorker included in its story.ìI categorically and unequivocally deny this allegation,î Kavanaugh said in the statement. ìI did not do this back in high school or at any time.îThe New Yorker included the facts about how the woman approached her congresswoman, Anna Eschoo (D-CA), which reveals the woman now lives in the Golden State.The letter was also sent to Feinstein, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who questioned Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing but did not refer to the woman or the letter.The New Yorker reported that the woman had decided to not advance her allegations, but:After the interactions with Eshooís and Feinsteinís offices, the woman decided not to speak about the matter publicly. She had repeatedly reported the allegation to members of Congress and, watching Kavanaugh move toward what looked like an increasingly assured confirmation, she decided to end her effort to come forward, a source close to the woman said.The New Yorker article describes the tense reaction to how Feinstein handled the revealing of the letter among fellow Democrats.ìFeinsteinís decision to handle the matter in her own office, without notifying other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, stirred concern among her Democratic colleagues,î the article stated. ìFor several days, Feinstein declined requests from other Democrats on the Judiciary Committee to share the womanís letter and other relevant communications.îEventually, Feinstein briefed other Democrats on the committee, but no staff was present at the briefing, according to the New Yorker.†Feinstein made a public announcement on Thursday.ìI have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,î Feinstein said. ìThat individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities.îThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the agency that received the letter, issued a generic statement: ìUpon receipt of the information on the night of September 12, we included it as part of Judge Kavanaughís background file, as per the standard process.îFollow Penny Starr on Twitter

Kavanaugh allegedly held a woman down and tried to force himself on her during a party before she got away, according to the New Yorker.The†New Yorker†then described the accusation, writing:In the letter, the woman alleged that, during an encounter at a party, Kavanaugh held her down, and that he attempted to force himself on her.

Although the alleged incident took place decades ago and the three individuals involved were minors, the woman said that the memory had been a source of ongoing distress for her, and that she had sought psychological treatment as a result.The White House blasted that accusation in a statement on Thursday, charging that this is a last-minute attempt to attack Kavanaugh after the Supreme Court nomination hearings.ìNot until the eve of his confirmation has Sen.

Dianne Feinsteinís (D-CA) last-second attempt to smear Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.After countless hours of hearings, a number of in-depth background checks, thousands of questions asked and answered, and numerous one-on-one meetings with senators of both parties, at the very last second Feinstein dramatically released a letter (she has reportedly had in her possession for months) to the FBI.ìI have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court,î†she said in a statement. ìThat individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities.îAccording to the far-left Washington Post, however, the FBI is not interested and will not be investigating the matter. The Post, however, was happy to add this: ìThe information came in a letter that describes an alleged episode of sexual misconduct involving the 53-year-old Kavanaugh when he was in high school, according to a person familiar with the matter.îThe ìmatter,î according to the Guardian, involves an alleged event that happened when Kavanaugh was still in high school. He stands accused of some mischief involving he and a friend locking a female student in a room. She found a way out. If this happened, Kavanaugh, who is now 53, was 17 years old at the time.Nevertheless, left-wing outlets like NBC News ran with headlines that read, ìSexual allegation against Kavanaugh referred to FBI by top Democrat.îAnd in that particular story, we have a prime example of what NBC News called ìjournalism.îTwo sources told NBC News the allegation was sexual in nature, but both said the letter writer was not specific in describing Kavanaughís alleged behavior. One source told NBC News the conduct described could allege sexual assault, but said it could also be a lesser allegation ó and added the individual making the allegation would have to be more specific with law enforcement officials for any investigation to be able to move forward.†[emphasis added]To the surprise of no one, the far-left ThinkProgress covered this in the exact same hysterical way NBC News did.The ThinkProgress headline and sub headline reads: ìBrett Kavanaugh has a mysterious #MeToo problemî ó ìAnd ëfederal investigative authoritiesí are involved.îHere is how the ThinkProgress story opens:Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh may have committed a very serious crime ó possibly even a sex crime. Or maybe he didnít.†[emphasis added]You can go ahead and laugh at ThinkProgress over the ìOr maybe he didnít,î but they are just aping the ìprofessional journalistsî over at NBC News. One way the far-left outlet did take the mud-slinging further, however, was by illustrating their piece with a photo of Kavanaugh standing over a young girl with his hands on her shoulders. They were shamed into changing the picture after publication.According to the Intercept, the woman who is the subject of Feinsteinís secret letter ìis now being represented by Debra Katz, a whistleblower attorney who works with #MeToo survivors. Joseph Abboud, an attorney at Katzís firm, said that the firm was declining to comment.îOh, and the far-left New York Times was no better:Two officials familiar with the matter say the incident involved possible sexual misconduct between Judge Kavanaugh and a woman when they were both in high school. They spoke anonymously because they were not authorized to discuss the matter.How lucky are Democrats that they can use the establishment media to spread unfounded smears on their behalf?Feinstein releases a vague statement about a vague incident she refers ó strictly for dramatic purposes ó to the FBI. Then the Democrat leakers run to their confederates in the elite media to whisper about ìsexual misconductî and ìMeToo,î and the smear machines that are NBC News and the New York Times give the Democrats exactly what they want.Meanwhile, a decent man is tarred for life.And over what?†Even if it is true ó if Kavanaugh, nearly 40 years ago, committed the worst sin of his life, this is still the biggest nothingburger ever.But that is not the point.The goal was manipulating a willing media into publishing ìsexual misconductî headlines, which of course they did.Democrats sure got it good.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Feinstein: ìI have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court"" and ""referred the matter to federal investigative authorities.î pic.twitter.com/ORpIeiNhpIó NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) September 13, 2018According to The New York Times, officials with knowledge of the allegations say the ìincident involved possible sexual misconduct between Judge Kavanaugh and a woman when they were both in high school.î A letter containing information regarding the alleged incident was initially received by Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), whose office forwarded the document to Feinstein ìthis summer.î Fox News reports Feinstein was sent the letter in July ó prior to the hearingsí September 4 start date. Feinstein only revealed the letterís existence during a meeting with fellow Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats Wednesday evening.The Times reveals ìseveralî Democrats have since urged Feinstein to relay the allegations to the†Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Washington Post reports the bureau is not considering investigating the matter at this time. ìAccording to a person familiar with the matter, the FBI does not now plan to launch a criminal investigation of the matter, which would normally be handled by local authorities, if it was within the statute of limitations,î the Post says.As Feinstein faces pressure to make the allegations public, various individuals familiar with the letter have told outlets differing accounts of the possible incident.ìDifferent sources†provided different†accounts of the contents of the letter, and some of the sources said they themselves had heard different versions,†but the one consistent theme was that it describes an incident†involving†Kavanaugh and a woman while they were in high school.† Kept hidden, the letter is beginning to take on a life of its own,î writes The Interceptís Ryan Grim.The unidentified woman has retained Debra Katz, a prominent†civil rights lawyer who represents various #MeToo victims.Sen. Chuck Grassleyís (R-IA) office says speculation surrounding the letter will not prevent lawmakers from voting on Kavanaughís confirmation September 20.ìSen. Grassley is aware of Senator Feinsteinís referral,î Taylor Foy, the Senate Judiciary Committee Chairmanís communications director, said in a statement. ìAt this time, he has not seen the letter in question, and is respecting the request for confidentiality. Thereís no plan to change the committeeís consideration of Judge Kavanaughís nomination.îRepublicans aim to have Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court by October 1.In response to the†letter, White House†spokesperson Kerri Kupec issued the following statement:†ìThroughout his confirmation process, Judge Kavanaugh has had 65 meetings with senatorsóincluding with Senator Feinsteinósat through over 30 hours of testimony, addressed over 2,000 questions in a public setting and additional questions in a confidential.îìNot until the eve of his confirmation has Sen. Feinstein or anyone raised the specter of new ëinformationí about him,î the official added.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/09/13/leadership-program-uses-young-people-to-increase-demand-for-abortion/,"A new ìleadershipî program is hoping to use the abortion stories of young people to normalize the procedure and increase easy access to it.ìItís time that our movement leaves no one behind and centers those who are most marginalized, and uplift their voices in media and organizing.î ñ @yamyan on the launch of Youth Testify, in partnership with @AdvocatesTweets, exclusively in @TeenVoguehttps://t.co/i2JR0sN3DHó NNAF Abortion Funds (@AbortionFunds) September 12, 2018We Testifyñ created by the National Network of Abortion Funds (NNAF) ñ never addresses the concept of young people abstaining from sex.Instead, it says†it is ìdedicated to increasing the spectrum of abortion storytellers in the public sphere and shifting the way the media understands the context and complexity of accessing abortion care.îFor @TeenVogue I spoke with @_Jordynkiera and other young people who have had abortions, and wrote about how theyíre letting the world know THEY are the experts of their own stories via programs from @AdvocatesTweets @AbortionFunds #AbortionOnMyTerms https://t.co/XH3H8UGXKUó Elly Belle <U+0001F52E> (@literElly) September 12, 2018In a feature story about the new program, Teen Vogue†focuses†on the case of Jordyn Close, a young black woman and ìabortion storyteller from Ohioî who is ìespecially passionate about dispelling the myth that finding out youíre pregnant and proceeding to get an abortion must be a harrowing or debilitating experience.îTeen Vogue†continues:For Jordyn, who went in and out, made casual conversation with her doctors while they performed the procedure, and then treated herself to Raising Caneís for chicken before returning home to once again watch TV and relax, it was a mostly normal day. Although Jordyn recognizes that the way her abortion story panned out is not always the norm, the ease she experienced is what she ultimately wants every person to have the opportunity to have.ìI just want there to be accessibility and intersectional accessibility,î Close said, adding:If weíre talking about access, that means something completely different to me, or another black woman. If there are more clinics, thatís great, but how are people paying? How are people getting to those? How are people taking care of their kids if they already have kids waiting at home? Thereís just so many other aspects that people donít think about.The new abortion story-telling program hopes to ìreframe the narrative around abortion by giving platform to some of the most vulnerable abortion storytellers ó particularly people of color, LGBTQ people, and people with varying abilities and citizenship statuses,î states Teen Vogue.ìThe goal of the program, according to the NNAF, is to show that young people who have had abortions are the experts on reproductive rights as well as the experts of their own experiences, and must be trusted with making decisions without anyone elseís permission,î the article says.In another ìstory,î Jessy, 22 ñ president of the Planned Parenthood Generation Action chapter at the University of California, Riverside ñ told Teen Vogue†she was ìshockedî to discover she was pregnant.ìI just didnít know what to do for myself even though I knew what I would always tell others,î she said.†ìKnowing that what was inside me kept growing as time progressed really did take an emotional toll on me, my grades, my social lifeÖ it wasnít until after I got my abortion that I got some sort of relief.îJessy said young people need an abortion clinic on or near college campuses that offer drugs that induce abortion, so that students wonít have to travel far from school to obtain abortions.We Testify says its mission is to ìbuild the power and leadership of abortion storytellers, particularly those of color, those from rural and conservative communities, those who are queer identified, those with varying abilities and citizenship statuses, and those who needed support when navigating barriers while accessing abortion care.îTeen Vogue†notes the program is launched as the abortion industry views federal protection to legal abortion in danger due to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Deb Hauser, president of Advocates for Youthñ another sponsor of the youth abortion storytelling program ñ said getting young people to speak out about the need for more abortion services is key.Weíre calling our Senators to demand they #StopKavanaugh and protect abortion access, LGBTQ rights, immigrant rightsí and workers. Join us by calling your Senators: 202-849-7460! pic.twitter.com/xsmWAZ9gqgó Advocates For Youth (@AdvocatesTweets) September 4, 2018ìWith this Administrationís unrelenting assault on everything we value, we need youth activists more than ever,î Hauser said†in a press statement announcing the new program.ìYoung people are leading the way on every fight worth having,î she also told Teen Vogue. ìWhether they are marching for gun control, police reform, immigrantsí rights, LGBTQ health and rights, racial justice or reproductive justice, young people are mobilizing for a more just and equitable world. Our job is to provide them with the tools and support they need to make their vision a reality.îWe're so excited to announce the launch of Youth Testify, a partnership between Advocates for Youth and @AbortionFunds .  Youth leaders who have experienced abortion are sharing their stories and working in their communities to ensure access.  https://t.co/VmbtbNVjlBó Advocates For Youth (@AdvocatesTweets) September 12, 2018NNAF also launched†the George Tiller Memorial Abortion Fund ñ named for the murdered abortionist ñ and created the Tiller Fund Report, which promotes the idea that no one should have to pay for their own abortion.ìThe results of this research suggest a need for repeal of discriminatory abortion policies and for abortion to be fully covered by all health insurance, both public and private,î NNAF states.ìRestrictions like parental consent laws make abortion care even harder for young people to obtain than for adults seeking the same or similar procedures,î adds Teen Vogue.

The way it is, is wrong.î She called the ìatmosphereî of her 96-3 voted confirmation ìtruly bipartisan.îìThe vote on my confirmation was 96-3, even though I had spent about 10 years of my life litigating cases under the auspices of the ACLU,î she explained. ìNo senator asked me any questions ó not about that.îGinsburg offered another example, in memory of the late Justice Anton Scalia: ìThink of Justice Scalia, whoís certainly a known character in, what was it? 1986,î she said, continuing:The vote was unanimous, every Democrat and every Republican voted for him. Thatís the way it should be, instead of what itís become, which is a highly partisan show. The Republicans move in lockstep, and so do the Democrats. I wish I could wave a magic wand and have it go back to the way it was.Despite the contentious nature of Kavanaughís confirmation hearings ó complete with allegations of perjury ó he is expected to gain more than the 50 votes needed for confirmation.Ginsburg will be portrayed by actress Felicity Jones in a new biopic that will premier on Christmas Day, 2018.

The margin of error is 3.5 points, giving Cramer a lead beyond the margin of error sampling.Heitkamp faces an uphill election battle in a state that Donald Trump won by a staggering 36 points and where 54 percent approve of his job performance.Eighty-four percent of Cramer supporters and 85 percent of Heitkamp supporters say they are confident they will vote for their preferred candidate. Only 15 percent of voters say they may change their voting preference before the election in the next two months.Men prefer Cramer by 15 points, while women support Heitkamp by seven percent. The North Dakota Republican also received 30 percent support from white evangelicals and 30 percent of voters emphasizing the economy.Given the increasingly competitive race between Heitkamp and Cramer, the North Dakotan faces more pressure to back President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court nominee, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, for the Supreme Court.One-quarter of North Dakota voters said if Sen. Heitkamp were to vote against Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court, it would make them less likely to vote for†Heitkamp in the midterm election; only 18 percent of North Dakotans suggested they would be more likely to vote for Heitkamp if she voted against Kavanaugh, while 53 percent said it would make no difference.Heitkamp is considered one of the most vulnerable Senate Democrats up for re-election this year, along with Sens.
