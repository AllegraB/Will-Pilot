They have a poll out showing Trumpís approval ratings have spiked and gone up at the conclusion of the Kavanaugh confirmation fight. Not cool. Also, independents disapprove of the Democratsí handling of the Kavanaugh nomination by a 28-point margin in the CNN poll. Thatís not how it was supposed to be. Thatís not what people were supposed to conclude. People were supposed to conclude that Kavanaugh is unfit!That Kavanaugh has no business being a judge anywhere, much less the Supreme Court! That Kavanaugh needs to be destroyed, justifiably so! Thatís what people were supposed to realize, and thatís what midterm voters were supposed to agree to: To punish anybody who would try to foist a despicable miscreant like Kavanaugh on the country. But it didnít work out that way. More on this, of course, but letís go to the phones. Weíll start in the nationís capital, Washington, D.C. This is Sandy. Iím glad you called. Hi.CALLER: I am so pleased to talk to you, Rush. Thanks for taking my call. I watched the president and Nikki Haley this morning. I think Nikki Haley did tell the president a few months ago of her plans. I think today was deliberate on the heels of Kavanaugh. I think heís got somebody in mind. Heís gonna announce that person before the election, and what are the Drive-Bys and the Democrats gonna do? Theyíre gonna start fighting. ìOh, we canít have this person. Oh, this is terrible. Da-da-da,î and then whatís gonna happen with the election? People are gonna say, ìItís not gonna stop.î We canít allow the Democrats back in, hopefully.RUSH: It isnít going to stop whether the Democrats win or lose. This is the point. Youíre right, but it isnít ever going to stop until these people are so soundly defeated and become such a very small group of peopleÖ Even then, theyíre not gonna stop. The Kavanaugh thing is not the end of anything. The Kavanaugh thing ó as far as most people are concerned ó the way you need to look at it is this is the beginning. This is the beginning of the way itís gonna be for as long as we allow it to be done to us.CALLER: Thatís right.RUSH: And, youíre right. Theyíre gonna try to poke holes into whoever Trumpís nominee for U.N. ambassador is. I havenít heard any names. I havenít played close enough attention to know who the names being bandied about might be. But theyíre gonna do it on principle. Theyíre gonna do it because they think itíll be a political advantage headed into the midterms, showing once again that the world, the country doesnít think Trump is justified and qualified to be naming anybody to this position.ìHe doesnít deserve to be president. We need to get rid of him!î This is the whole foundation for which theyíre gonna behave anyway. The question is, does this hurt them or help them? And not with their base. I mean, we know their base is driving this. But with others, as all this never-ending obstruction and personal destruction of nominee after nominee after nominee. Weíll see. I appreciate the call, Sandy. You talk about being outnumbered: One of us living in Washington, the 10% of the population thatís not Democrat.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Morgan Stanley says that belief in American exceptionalism has never been higher among international investors.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/09/kavanaugh-swearing-in-ceremony-demonstrated-donald-trumps-irreplaceable-value/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 9, 2018RUSH: There was quite an event at the White House last night ó the ceremonial swearing-in of Judge Kavanaugh ó and, once again, last night, Donald Trump demonstrated his irreplaceable value. He demonstrated why he is a champion to the majority of people in this country. He violated another set of no-noís. He did something youíre not supposed to do in a ceremony like this at the White House.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Last night the ceremonial swearing-in Brett Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court was there, including Ruth ìBuzziî Ginsburg, whoÖ Well, never mind. (interruption) Yeah, she was awake. You know, sheís admitted that she shows up at States of the Union speeches having consumed a little wine to get through the night. Itís why she is seen falling asleep. Of course, thereís nothing wrong with that. Elena Kagan was there, the Harvard Law School dean, who way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard.Elena Kagan, who now says, ìI donít think he should be on the court. I ó Iím not sure that this is going to do the court any good.î Justice Thomas was there. A whole bunch of people. Anthony Kennedy, who Kavanaughís replacing. Here is the president of the United States. Weíre starting here at audio sound bite No. 7. He is apologizing to Kavanaugh on behalf of the nation.THE PRESIDENT: I would like to begin tonightís proceeding differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude. On behalf of our nation, I want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure. Those who stepped step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation, not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception.RUSH: Just calling them out! Trump is right: This is not done. Normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing-in, you follow the script and all of that is in the past. Itís not to be referenced again. The fight is over; everybody acknowledges that the result is the result and weíre moving forward. Except thatís not the way it is anymore! The Democrats are not stopping. The fightís not over to them. The Democrats are openly promising to impeach Kavanaugh. Theyíre openly promising to continue to investigate Kavanaugh.They are openly talking about the packing the court if they win the House of Representatives, to the power Kavanaugh has as the fifth so-called conservative justice on the court. Theyíre not pulling back at all. This isnít anywhere over, and so Trump is calling them out. And Iím telling you, folks, this is crucial. I canít think of any former president that would ever do anything like this. In defense of his nominee, in defense of his principles, I canít think of one who would do it.Itís just as important that Trump do this as it was important when Trump, at a rally, explained to the American people what the American media had not told them, when he recited the essence of her testimony. When the Drive-Bys said that he was mocking Dr. Blasey Ford, he wasnít mocking. He was simply informing the American people what the media was holding from them: She couldnít tell anybody where it happened! She couldnít tell them when it happened; she wasnít sure where the house was.She didnít know how she got home and she didnít know who took her, and she didnít know what she said after the event, that the only thing she remembered is that she had one beer ó that the four people she said were there in the house all denied it. The press had told nobody that. The American people that only consume what we call mainstream media had no idea of all of these holes in her testimony until Donald Trump told everybody at his rally, and he was doing the same thing with the same principle in this apology last night at the White House.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, folks, a little heads-up here. Iím going to continue today my attempt at explaining the divide that exists in the country, specifically by explaining just who the left is, what theyíve become, what weíre up against. To me, it is the seminal issue that we all face. Weíre talking about nothing less than the survival of the country as we know it. I mean, Americaís always gonna be here; donít misunderstand. But this country surviving as founded.We are under assault; it has never been worse.Maybe the Civil War, but those were different circumstances. That was a specific argument about cultural things regarding slavery that, in the end, nobody of any reasoned attitude could ever support. We find ourselves here in a multilayered, multifaceted, all-out assault on the entire concept of America as founded. Some people sense it. Some people are not aware of it. And Iíve just sort of evolved here into a position where I feel compelled to try to explain this, sound some warning bells and maybe present some solutions.I have to be very careful I donít overdo this. I donít want toÖ You know me, Iím the nationís No. 1 natural optimist, and I donít want to sound overly pessimistic. But at the same time Iím still searching for the best way, the perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats that we face are. So thatís coming up as the program unfolds. Back, however, to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president.First off, apologizing to the nation, apologizing to Kavanaugh on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him, for what happened to him! And the Kavanaugh episode codifies exactly what I think we are up against. And it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding. Weíre not in a battle of ideas. The left is not interested in our ideas. Weíre battling people who do not want us to exist. They have no desire to coexist with us.They have no desire for the ongoing political arguments over the best way to do things for a majority of people. Thatís not their interest. Their interest is the elimination of opposition, however it can happen. They have no limits on how low they will go, on how depraved and perverted they will be in seeking their reality. It all, I am convinced, started on American college campusÖ Well, tracing where it started, I mean, go back to the twenties and Soviet influence, communist influence.But for the purposes of my being able to explain this, the most recent starting point would be the most compelling, and I think best way to get peopleís attention with it. Because most peopleís historical perspective begins with the day they were born. So ancient history isÖ If theyíve not been taught it, they donít know it. So the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems, the more effective persuasion will be. Itís always been my feeling on this, my thought.But they donítÖ Folks, we are not legitimate in their eyes. Our ideas are not legitimate; our existence is not legitimate, and not even worthy of discussing or acknowledgment. In fact, they donít even look at the United States the way we do. They donít accept the founding of the country, the principles in our founding documents. They accept none of that. None of that is relevant. All of that is part of the discrimination that was founded as part of this country, as far as theyíre concerned.And it was all on display in the Kavanaugh hearings, everything that we are up against. The absence of presumption of innocence? Kavanaugh was guilty because heís a conservative. Kavanaugh was guilty, not because they had any evidence. Kavanaugh was guilty because, in their minds, heís got no business being a judge! And heís got no business being a judge because heís not one of them. Itís no more complicated than that. How they get rid of him? Thatís another story.But his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that heís not on their team, that heís not one of them. So anything that can get rid of him and derail him, in their world, is entirely not just permissible, but itís required. If you have to deny him the presumption of innocence, then thatís what weíll do. If you bring forward a woman who canít prove what she says but is believable saying it, then thatís fine; thatís what weíll do.If it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for months coming up with this, then thatís what weíll do. It has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isnít them and he, therefore, doesnít deserve to be on the Supreme Court. The rest of it ó the histrionics, the childlike wailing and immaturity ó is the result of the liberal-socialist mind-set. People, young people, immature children that donít get their way are already suffering psychological disorders of one kind or another.Like the video. That video of these kids on Saturday afternoon literally clawing at the doors of the Supreme Court to get in, to try to stop the real swearing in! They were literally clawing at the doors! There wasnít any humanity in this. This was just raw hatred and fear coupled with massive psych disorders. All of it promoted, not denounced ó all of it promoted and encouraged ó by the powers that be in the media and the Democrat Party and the citadels of the left. As Iíve been saying, what do decent people do in response to this?Decent people, weíre not gonna become them. They have, as an objective, ruination and total human destruction of their opponents. Thatís us. Do not doubt me on this. That may sound a little extreme to those of you that are here on the periphery. Do not doubt me. That is their objective: total destruction and ruination. Well, how do we fight that? Decent people are not gonna try to ruin their political opponents. Theyíre gonna try to beat them. But weíre not gonna become who they are.We donít have it in us to become who they are. So, given that, how are they stopped? Itís a serious question. If they are willing to do anything, including de facto career and life political murder to stop things they donít want, to stop people that they donít want, how do you oppose them? How do you beat that back? Do you do it with decency? Do you do it with politeness? Do you do it with manners? Sorry, it isnít gonna cut it.Sorry, Never Trumpers, but the right manners and comportment and so forth isnít going to cut it. Some people might say, ìRush, the church. The church is rock solid. The church is where enduring values live.î Not anymore. The churches are like every other institution, sucking up to the people they think hold power. Everybody needs money. Churches need money. All kinds of people need money. And if the people who are gonna give you money demand you be a certain way and be open to certain things, then youíre gonna do it!This is happening.Take a look at Il Papa and whatís even happening to the Catholic Church in places. We have a serious, serious problem when talking about the preservation of what I call our way of life underneath the umbrella of decency. So weíre very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against it from the highest levels of power in the country. Donald Trump fearlessly pushes back on it, calls them out, identifies them. Theyíre not used to this. They donít know how to react to it.The media is the greatest illustration of that, not knowing how to react to be called out for what they really are. I mean, everybodyís accused the media of being biased over the years. But nobody accuses them of fake, making it up, participating in the open and wanton ruination of people. Nobody ever accuses them of that. I mean, we may here. But at the highest levels of government, itís never happened before. Thereís Donald Trump doing it ó and from the East Room of the White House!Here is more Trump last night. This really triggered íem, when he declared Kavanaugh innocentÖTHE PRESIDENT: What happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness, decency, and due process. In our country, a man or a woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.CROWD: (applause)THE PRESIDENT: And with that, I must state that you, sir, under historic scrutiny, were proven innocent. Thank you.RUSH: Oh, did thatÖ? That ripped íem a new one right there. That justÖ That ha to óTHE PRESIDENT: Margaret and Liza, your father is a great man. Heís a man of decency, character, kindness, and courage who has devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens.RUSH: You know what that is? Iím sorry, Never Trumpers, but thatís just pure class. To take the time to look at those two little girls and tell him that their father is a great man? In the midst of all of this, the president of the United States taking time out to tell those two young daughters of Brett and Ashley Kavanaugh that your father is a great man? Every father wants to hear that. Every father loves having his children told that heís a great man. Few ever are afforded that opportunity, but Trump did it last night.Then proclaiming Kavanaughís innocence. I mean, that is akin to taking all the poison arrows that every Democrat launched at Kavanaugh the past two weeks and firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat senator on the Judiciary Committee and every member of the media that tried to ruin Kavanaugh. To openly proclaim him innocent! ìHe canít do that! That wasnít a court of law. He canít know.î But they had him guilty, did they?He was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation. I want to say one more time: I donít believe anything that we went through the past two weeks, starting with the realization that Christine Blasey Ford had written a letter to Dianne Feinstein. I donít think any of it was spontaneous and I donít think any of it was happenstance. I think every bit of was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October Surprise in politics is. I think the Democrats were in on it.I donít know whether Blasey Fordís privacy was violated. I donít know if she was in on it or if she was also a stooge. But somebody suggested she write that letter: Monica McLean, her buddy, who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara (who hates Trump, the SDNY United States attorney), as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump-Russia collusion. I donít think they ever expected it to get as far as it did.They thought Trump would pull back, withdraw the nomination or that Kavanaugh would pull out, and they would never get as far as it got. It was clearly illustrated she had no evidence, no corroboration, no nothing. In their strategizing of this event, they never thought it would go that far. One of the reasons is theyíre used to Republican presidents caving. A Nominee gets in big trouble? Pull the nomination. Presidents donít want the grief.It starts to reflect poorly on them, so they go to the nominee. ìLookÖ (big sigh) It wonít work, Nominee. We canít sustain this. You gotta pull out.î The nominee says, ìAh, damn! Itís my one chance!î ìSorry, Nominee, Iím pulling support.î The nominee and the president get together for the good of the country, blah, blah, blah, and the nominee pulls out. It didnít happen here. Trump refused to pull out, withdraw; ditto Kavanaugh. Thatís where they gummed up the works.  "

Everybody doing okay out there? What a great weekend, eh? Everybody go out there and celebrate by having a beer in Justice Kavanaughís honor? I certainly hope so. (interruption) No, no, no. Not in a Solo Cup but right out of the can or right out of the bottle. You donít pour beer in a Solo Cup.Greetings, my friends, and welcome. Here we are ready, willing, and able to kick off yet another brand-new week of broadcast excellence. Our telephone number, if you want to be on the program, 800-282-2882.What do you bet after this brouhahaÖ? This vote ended up being 50-48. What do you bet after all of this brouhaha, after all the angst, after all the character and life assassination the Democrats tried on Kavanaugh, what do you bet that the vote would have turned out exactly the same regardless what the Democrats did? The Democrats didnít sway one vote. They gave it everything they had but they did not sway one vote.Murkowski even at the end of the day ended up canceling out her ìnoî vote by pairing her ìpresentî with Senator Daines who couldnít be there because of his daughterís marriage. I mean, all of this ó and the vote was not ó I could make the case that the vote would have been probably the same. It would have been along party lines, and none of that had any effect on the outcome. But it did have an impact on much else. And, as we get into the program today, gonna be examining some impacts of the activities of the Democrats.Iím a little conflicted about this because Iím not sure ó Iím pretty sure but Iím not quite sure of something. Iíve got a tweet here that got me started thinking about this. I have a tweet from our old buddy Nate Silver, and wouldnít you know it? Iíve put it out of order from where IÖ He makes the point hereÖ Here it is: ìThe football-spiking after Kavanaugh was confirmed this weekend was one such example. Thereís always *some* of that after a big policy/electoral win, but thereís also usually a fair amount of magnanimity and reaching out to the losing side. Not so this time.îThis tweet of Nate Silverís is totally absentÖ It ignores the infantile screaming. Did any of you watch the vote on Saturday? Did you hear the infantile, baby-like shouting and screaming from those women up in the gallery? J. Christian Adams has written about it and has expressed it almost exactly as I would say it. I mean, this was just guttural immaturity, scary psychological disorder. I mean, it was embarrassing; it was frightening in the sense that thatís who the base of the Democrat Party is. And I really wonderÖThereís a part of me that wonders ó and itís a very small part. I wonder if the Democrats at large ignore that and do not think that that behavior is tied to them. They donít do anything to stop it. And, in fact, they encourage it! Maxine Waters is out there encouraging it. Mazie Hirono is out there. Did you hear what Mazie Hirono said? Mazie Hirono says people are totally justified in harassing Republicans in public in restaurants and even in their homes and forcing them out because theyíre white racists.Theyíre white supremacists. Theyíre totally, totally justified. So thereís a part of me that knows the Democrats are promoting this. Thereís another part who thinks some Democrats do not think that this deranged psychological upset is tied to them. Let me put it this way. If we had people on our side behaving like this, it would worry me to death. It would worry me to death that voters are gonna think that conservatism is made up of deranged lunatics like this! The Democrats donít seem to be concerned about that at all.Some of them, like Nate Silver here, donít even think that that behavior is assumed by voters to be the behavior of mainstream Democrats. And I wonder if thatís true, and if it is true, how can they be so obtuse? If it isnít true and if they are aware of it and are proud of it and are encouraging it, then the question becomes this: When you get into turnout for the November elections and the midtermsÖ By the way, you know what people are now saying, Mr. Snerdley?The Democrats, some of the people on TV are saying, ìWell, I donít think that we know yet what issues are ignore turn the vote in November.î (chuckles) I wonder where they heard that? I wonder where they heard that idea. Well, we donít actually know the issues that are gonna turn the turnout of the election yet. We have still a month to go before the election. It is an interesting question, though. Will any of the passion fade away on either or both sides of this?On the Democrat side, itís not gonna fade away, and I think everybody needs to know this. On the Democrat side, this deranged lunacy has become the defining characteristic of todayís Democrat Party and the American left. You have to remember these people have been off their rocker since November of 2016. They have been mad, insane, crazy, percolating, compounding, compressing all of this ever since then. They have been loaded for bear ever since Election Day and the day after, 2016.Then this Kavanaugh situation comes up. And I donít think, on the Democrat side, they can get any more hysterical. And I donít think they can get any more motivated than they are. I think they are at their peak right now. I mean, theyíre still talking about investigating Kavanaugh further. Pelosi wants to see the FBI documents released. She wants a full-fledged investigation of Kavanaugh. The Democrats are talking about Jerrold Nadler ó the House Judiciary Committee ranking member of the Democrats ó promising if the Democrats win the House, that theyíre gonna impeach Kavanaugh, gonna investigate him, get him thrown off the court.Theyíre not gonna let this subside. This Kavanaugh thing is not over, and theyíre gonna continue to rile their side up and motivate them and courage them to continue engaging in what you and I would call this massive civil disobedience, also itís more than that. Itís genuine childlikeÖ Itís not even childlike. Weíre dealing with a complete emotional breakdown and a group of peopleÖ I donít care whether theyíre paid or not, folks. I donít want to fall back on that to suggest that this anger they feel is not legitimate.Itís legitimate, whether theyíre being paid or not. I donít think that means that the real enthusiasm of Democrat voters is less than what we think it is, just because some people have announced that they accepted money to go do this stuff. I donít think that they look would sit around and do nothing and twiddle their thumbs all weekend long if they werenít being paid. I think the Democrat rage is real, and itís been real since election night 2016. They thought they were gonna win; they thought they were gonna win in a landslide.They havenít been able to come to grips with that. The Kavanaugh thing is just further evidence that elections have consequences. They sense themselves losing control and losing and losing, and they canít deal with it. They simply cannot deal with it. And rather than do whatís necessary to put themselves back together and become a winning enterprise, they continue with their primary strategy of trying to tear down and destroy the opposition and eliminate it.Rather than do whatís necessary to reach a broad swath and majority of the American people ó which they cannot do in their current makeup. Which is why I ask over and over if the Democrats at large, elected Democrats, really are unaware of the impression these people are creating about them when these are mad, insane, disgusting Democrat protesters, they are identified with the Democrat Party. And I donít know if some elected Democrats really get that. I could be all wet. They could totally get it, and they could be promoting it, which is probably closer to the truth than not.But for those that donít get it, it amazes me that it is possible that these professional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative of the party at large. Hereís J. Christian Adams writing at PJ Media. ìKavanaugh Foes Fill Senate Gallery with Sounds of the Insane.î ìIf there was any doubt that the opposition to Kavanaugh was unhinged, uncivil, disruptive, rude, and borderline nuts, my experience in the gallery made it clear.î ìI have visitedÖî This is Chris Adams writing.ìI have visited hospitals for the seriously mentally ill, and the shrieks from this woman were as odd and unearthly as anything I ever heard inside a mental hospital. They echoed off the halls and ceilings outside the gallery in decreasing but astonishing amplitude. Then the roll was called, and it sounded like the gates of hell opened up. Nearly a dozen women erupted in unison, shouting, howling, screaming, in an unrecognizable venomous wail. They wouldnít stop. There was fury, rage, hate, poison in the noise.ìIt wasnít prose. It wasnít song. It was a swarming, shrill, swirling noise. Ö They were the sounds of irrational, unhinged, and unmoored lunatics. These were the people who opposed Kavanaughís nomination. They were an embarrassment to themselves,î and, he writes, ìPay attention, thatís what the Left sounds like.î Yeah, it is, and the Democrat Party doesnít seem to the least bit concerned about it. The Democrat Party doesnít seem to be the least bit embarrassed by it. The Democrat Party at large doesnít seem to worry at all that this kind of discordant madness is going to negatively impact them in the elections.In fact, they may think the opposite. They may think that this is whatís going to further inspire more discordant madness, which will result in massive turnout. They believe itís going to frighten Republicans into not confronting them and basically letting them have their way, because who wants to deal with lunatics and the insane face-to-face. But what it means to me is I donít know that they can get more rabid. I donít know that thereís anything else that can happen that get them more fired up than they are.Stephen Colbert has a writer on his staff. That show couldnít occur without writers. Iím very proud to say here no writers on the Rush Limbaugh program. Every time I see this, I donít care if itís CarsonÖ Carson had writers. Letterman had writers. The Daily Show had writers. A lot of them, 12 to 14 of the íem out there. Every one of these late-night shows has writers. We donít have any writers here. Now, granted, we donít do monologue, stand-up jokes here, but we do delve into exquisite comedy and humor here frequently. But there arenít any writers here.Itís just a professional thing with me. How much credit should these hosts get when they donít even write most of their own material? And the people who do write are not ever supposed to be known. Theyíre supposed to dutifully, willingly be invisible, stand or sit in the background and never let it be said that they provide the material for the host of any of these late-night shows. Well, there are no producers here, and there are no writers here, and there are no segments here. There are no story boards. Thereís no segment layout or any of that.This show just happens. But one of the writers on the Colbert show is named Ariel Dumas. (Maybe she pronounces it Dumas. Who knows?) One of her tweets ó which was deleted but many people screenshotted it so that it survives. ìWhatever happens,î she tweeted, ìIím just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaughís life.î ìWhatever happens, Iím just glad we ruined Brett Kavanaughís life.î Never Trumpers were siding with these kind of people a year ago.Weíve reached a point where I think any assault or crime committed against a Republican by a Democrat should be investigated as a hate crime. I mean, this hate is visceral. It consumes them. It is dangerous bigotry. And the Democrats believe this is going to win elections. The Democrats think that this is gonna inspire turnout, that itís going to inspire all kinds of enthusiasm. But what else might it be doing? There are a lot of people, folks, who are not immersed and absorbed daily in the ebb and flow of politics.And these people largely believe that Democrats are silent and quiet and reasonable and tolerant and carrying and compassionate and look out in the little guy, you know all the old cliches.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, I am reliably told that correct pronunciation of Stephen Colbertís writerís last name is ìdumbass,î Ariel ìDumbass,î not ìDoo-mahs,î and Iím sorry for getting it wrong. You know, her account included several other anti-Kavanaugh tweets. Quote, ìBrett Kavanaugh 100% gonna ask Justice Sotomayor to fetch him coffee.î This was a Saturday tweet. I donít thinkÖ Does she know how stupid these people are? Do you know that the freshman, the newly arrived justice does that? The newly arrived justice gets that kind of grunt duty.You would think that kind of thing wouldnít exist on the Supreme Court, but it does. The newly arrived justice has to do all that kind of stuff. Itís part of the initiation, and it lasts for a while. Not until the next justice shows up, but it lasts for a while. But Sotomayor is not gonna be getting him his coffee and heís not gonna be demanding it. In fact, he named his law clerks. Do you know heís the only Supreme Court justice ever with four female law clerks? And of course do you think that is garnering him any credit with the left?No, itís the exact opposite. They say, ìWell, he wants easy pickings.î (interruption) Well, that is. Thatís how theyíre reacting to it. ìHe wants easy pickings. Heís not an idiot. We all know who Kavanaugh is! He abuses women, and he wants four of them right there nearby.î Thatís how theyíre reacting to that. Ariel Dumbass also criticized Kavanaugh for stroking his family in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. She wrote, ìItís not automatically a moral achievement to be a son, a husband, a dad. Itís biology. A legal decision and biology again. PlentyÖîI canít read what she says in a family show. And then she admitted she was emotionally shattered by the current state of affairs, which just proves the theory the Democrats are mentally disturbed people who project their mental problems onto the public, onto politics. It is exactly what is happening here. Do not underestimate that. And donít think that Iím being flippant or exaggerational to make a point. I really do believe that weíre talking about mainstream mental and psychological disorders becoming standard operating procedure politics, the American leftÖThereís no other way to explain this. Now, folks, to show you how deranged this is, I have in the stack today, I have two, maybe three what I would call teachable moment things. They are opinion pieces that appear in the mainstream media both today and over the weekend. They are related to Kavanaugh, but theyÖ The pieces attempt to say what all of this means for America and, of course, for the Democrats. And much of it is just so dead wrong in the simple recitation of the facts of all this that it stuns me that people on the left cannot even face the facts of this and react to them!They continue to react to what they think has gone on based on how they feel. And these are some of the standard-bearers of American journalism on the left. One of them is John Harris at Politico, one of the founders. ìDemocrats fear they are the wet rag party.î You know what this piece is about? This piece is about how the Democrats get their rear ends handed to íem every time because the Democrats are a bunch of cowards. The Democrats have no guts. The Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers. The Democrats let Republicans walk all over íem.Now, how many of you think itís the exact opposite? This is pretty common too. There are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side is a bunch of wusses. But I donít know how anybody paying attention on the left can think that their sideís a bunch of wusses, but the fact that they do is fascinating to me. Now, hereís another such piece. And we have cited this woman once before. I donít remember specifically when. Her name is Alexis Grenell. She has ìwritten on gender and politics for the New York Daily News, the Washington Post, and other outlets.îShe had a piece on Saturday in the New York Times. It may have been actually published on Sunday and released on the Web on Saturday night. The dateís October 6th. Since I donít read the paper anymore, I donít know when this stuff actually shows up in the print edition. So my guess is this thing was released Saturday night on the Web to be published in the Sunday paper but it could have been in the Saturday paper as well. Doesnít matter. ìWhite Women, Come Get Your People.î I donít even know where women whose thoughts are this convolutedÖ And youíre gonna hear.I donít know where they come from.I donít know whoís responsible for creating them, molding them. I think itís gender studies. I think itís a combination of feminism and gender studies that literally corrupt young minds. In fact thereís another lengthy piece today that describes a hoax, three self-described leftists ran on academe. In a nutshell, three academics, self-described left-wingers are doing a kind of Project Veritas-like expose of how left-wing journals accept crazy studies, as long as they contain the right buzzwords and support leftist doctrine.Theyíve gotten journals of higher learning in applied disciplines of the academy to accept utter nonsense! One example of this is a feminist journal in academia accepted an anti-male rewrite of Mein Kampf. These hoaxters rewrote a 3,000-word essay of Mein Kampf and tooled it as anti-male, pro-woman feminism, and this journal accepted it! So basically they accepted a piece, an excerpt from Adolf Hitlerís Mein Kampf, ìretooledî to have terms that would be buzzwords and knee-jerk reaction causes to them. And they ended up falling for it on the left, hook, line, and sinker.The reason why left-wingers are doing this is because theyíre worried that the disciplines that they trust and believe in are being shattered by a bunch of absolute gobbledygook insanity. And so they have prepared a series of hoax essays and papers and presented for peer review to journals of higher learning in the academy. Theyíre obvious hoaxes to anybody who knows anything about the originals of the papers that serve as the basis. In this case, Mein Kampf.But this group of women accepted an essay right out of Mein Kampf with just a couple or three words or terms changed to make it look like it was an anti-male, pro-feminist piece. Utterly embarrassing. The details of this are long and detailed and in the weeds. But it is that kind of thinking that makes me wonder, or makes me realize, where people like Alexis Grenell come from. ìWhite Women: Come Get Your People.î Let me give you just a sample pull quote to give you an idea what Iím talking about.ì[W]hite women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their whiteness to monopolize resources for mutual gain. In return theyíre placed on a pedestal to be ëcherished and revered,í as Speaker Paul D. Ryan has said about women, but all the while denied basic rights.î Does anybody have any idea what that is? Did that make any sense? When you heard me read that, did you go, ìOh, yeah! Yeah! Totally agree with that!î No. Youíre shaking your head, saying, ìWhat?î Let me read it again. ìî[W]hite women benefit from patriarchyÖîFor those of you in Rio Linda, ìpatriarchyî means like where you live, women are subjugated by the men; men run your house, right? Thatís what this means, patriarchy. ì[W]hite women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their whiteness to monopolize resources for mutual gain.î In other words, they trade on their ìwhitenessî to find rich white guys to marry. They sell out the sisterhood, they sell themselves out, all to be placed on pedestals. But in doing so, they are denied basic rights by the patriarchy, and women who do this are sellouts and are not happy.So every one of you white women whoís married, loves your husband, loves your family, youíre a sellout. Now, this has roots traceable back to the origin of militant feminism in the late 60s. But then you have to stop and grab yourself and say she, Alexis Grenell, really believes this, and the New York Times must because they published it. ìAfter a confirmation process where women all but slit their wrists, letting their stories of sexual trauma run like rivers of blood through the Capitol, the Senate still voted to confirm Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.ìWith the exception of Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, all the women in the Republican conference caved, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who held out until the bitter end.î (Repeating) ì[W]omen all but slit their wrists, letting their stories of sexual trauma run like rivers of blood through the Capitol.î I guess sheís talking about Blasey Ford, some of the others that bared it all except Blasey Ford didnít bare anything. We donít still know where, what happened, and we donít know who did it!Anyway, next paragraph: ìThese women are gender traitors, to borrow a term from the dystopian TV series The Handmaidís Tale. Theyíve made standing by the patriarchy a full-time job. The women who support them show up at the Capitol wearing ëWomen for Kavanaughí T-shirts, but also probably tell their daughters to put on less revealing clothes when they go out. Theyíre more sympathetic to Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, who actually shooed away a crowd of women and told them to ëgrow up.íìOr Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, whose response to a woman telling him she was raped was: ëIím sorry. Call the cops.í These are the kind of women who think that being falsely accused of rape is almost as bad as being raped. The kind of women who agree with President Trump that ëitís a very scary time for young men in America,í which he said during a news conference on Tuesday. But the people who scare me the most,î writes Alexis Grenell, ìare the mothers, sisters and wives of those young men, because my stupid uterus still holds out some insane hope of solidarity.îYou women who love your husband have gotten married, have had families, including sons, who supported Kavanaugh, you are selling out your utter fellow uteruses out there, and this Alexis Grenell is fit be over it! Because youíre being tricked by the patriarchy. Youíre thinking youíre happy and having a good time but youíre not, youíre miserable, your rights are being denied, youíre being mocked and laughed at by people like Donald Trump who think youíre nothing more than a uterus!ìWeíre talking about white women,î she writes. ìThe same 53% who put their racial privilege ahead of their second-class gender status in 2016 by voting to uphold a system that values only their whiteness, just as they have for decades. Since 1952, white women have broken for Democratic presidential candidates only twice: in the 1964 and 1996 elections, according to an analysis by Jane Junn, a political scientist at the University of Southern California.îì[W]hite women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their whitenessÖî Does anybody know what this means? This is what your daughters are being taught! This stuff is enraging your daughter, making your daughter mad. Your daughters. This is the reaction to Kavanaugh being confirmed to the Supreme Court. Folks, itís not intellectual. Itís not scholarship. This is certainly not above average intellect. This is just plain incomprehensible drivel, disguised as learned education and discourse in 2018, and this is how women can end up going and can taught by other women like this and end up coming out of school raging and angry over they donít even know what.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: And this Alexis Grenell is not the only woman writing this way. Liberal writers and activists are attacking ìwhite womenî all over the media today. ìWhite womenî are to blame for standing by, supporting Kavanaugh, helping him get confirmed. Alexis Grenell, in her piece, writes, ìThis blood pact between white men and white women is at issue in the November midterms. President Trump knows it, and at that Tuesday news conference, he signaled to white women to hold the line: ëThe people that have complained to me about it the most about whatís happening are women.ìëWomen are very angry,í he said. ëI have men that donít like it, but I have women that are incensed at whatís going on.'î Everybody knows women who are incensed going on because they have husbands that they love and sons that theyíre worried about. And these leftist women think those other women ó you mothers of sons ó are sellouts and traitors, including with your uteruses. This is sick! It is downright sick! It is not even based in a common sense with even a community of understanding. And the Democrats think this kind of thing is whatís going to generate a massive blue wave in the House. IÖ (sigh) Well, Iíll have more on that. Iím gonna get started on the phones. Weíre gonna go to Denver. This is David. David, thank you for calling. You are first. Itís great to have you with us. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Reformed Android user dittos. How are you?RUSH: Thank you, sir.

But the level of vitriol, the outright rage that they threw at this, this whole entire ó and youíve kind of alluded to this already. Reason has been thrown out the window with the left, and we are a nationÖ As has been said a number of times, ìWe are a nation of laws,î and they seem to be lawless. They seem to be willing to do anything to undermine or remove somebody from consideration to the nationís highest court because thatís their last bastion of hope. Heaven forbid these individuals go into power this fall. You know, thereísÖ I donít believe in the blue wave, either. But if they do, our country is based upon a very fragile tension, almost.RUSH: Oh, I agree with you totally. His pointÖ Iím only taking over here ícause I got 20 seconds and Iím a communications specialist. Iíll say it in as few words as possible. David here is worried that despite victory here, the left has gotten so deranged that they threaten the very structure of America with that rage ó and with violence and bullying intent ó they intend to basically strip away everything democratically elected simply because they donít like it, using violence and bullying. And itís a legitimate concern. Thatís why they have to be defeated at the ballot box to start with!  "

Great to have you, sir. Hello.CALLER: Thank you, Rush, so much. Super huge mega, big, big dittos, my friend.RUSH: Thank you, sir.CALLER: Longtime listener. Probably 1993 was when I started listening daily, and was actually lucky enough to see you in Philadelphia at the Kimmel Center when you auctioned off your Harry Reid letter.RUSH: Oh, that was awesome! That was on the campus of the university. What a great hall that was. That was one of the nicest venues Iíve ever had a public appearance in.CALLER: And it was one of our funnest nights ever. My brother, Joe, got the tickets. I was lucky enough to tag along with a few other family members, and it was quite memorable. You told the best Hillary Clinton joke Iíve ever heard in my life.RUSH: (chuckles) Was that the elevator joke?CALLER: Yeah!RUSH: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. (laughing)CALLER: Hey, Rush?RUSH: (laughing)CALLER: Iíll get right to the point.RUSH: (laughing) Now you got me in a situation everybody wants to hear the joke since you brought it up. I donít want to encroach on your time. What was it that you called about?CALLER: You know, Rush, the left is fully aware that there are things behind the scenes that the public will never know. We call it the deep state, but thatís their standard operating procedure. So you were talking earlier about things we wouldnít know or that American citizens wouldnít know behind the scenes that had the Democrats stone faced yesterday and why they know that Kavanaughís gonna be confirmed. You know, our only hope, my familyís only hope is that their hatred of Kavanaugh means he really is that good.RUSH: Oh, he is, in that sense.CALLER: Yeah?RUSH: Thereís a rap on Kavanaugh too. You know what the rap on Kavanaugh is? That heís a Bush establishment guy. I mean, he is the staff secretary for George W. Bush in the first term. The rap on him is heís not a deep stater, but that he is a swamp dweller. And there are some people who think that there could have been a more conservative choice, Amy Coney Barrett.CALLER: I like her a lot.RUSH: But he is good. Donít believe any of that. This guy threatens the Democrats as much as if Antonin Scalia were back alive and were up for reconfirmation.CALLER: Good. You know, as much as theyíve tried and thrown at this guy, I mean, theyÖ I really think that their only purpose behind the continued FBI investigation was to try to make it like Mueller. You know, dig for everything until you find something.RUSH: Oh! Thereís no question. Delay, delay, delay and get lucky and find something that you could make people believe or find something that really existed. No, youíre absolutely right about everything so far.CALLER: (chuckles) Well, they take advantage of the fact that people like me ó even though Iíve been listening since í93 ó you know, work every day. Iíve got seven kids. What we do every day. We donít have time to tune in to every little morsel. So what happens, unfortunately, to the rest of the country that doesnít listen to Rush Limbaugh ó thereís not that many. (chuckles) But the ones that donít, they get these tidbits on the evening news from the Drive-By Media. They have notice clue what the real news of the day or the news of the week is.RUSH: Oh, tell me. Tell me about it. Look, there are two big developments that the people that only watch Drive-By Media do not know. They do not know that know Blasey Fordís lawyer has been out there suborning perjury, that they tried to get Leland Keyser to change her testimony to say, ìOh, yeah! You know what? I do remember being at the house when Kavanaugh attacked Christine!îThey actively tried to get her to change her testimony, and thereís one other thing slipping my mind. But neither of these two stories have been reported! Nobody in America outside conservative media knows any of that. Thatís exactly right. I wish I could remember. Iím having a mental clock on what the second story is. Itís related. Itís all related to Blasey Ford. There are two things here that the Drive-By MediaÖ (interruption)Oh, yeah, the boyfriend letter! The boyfriend letter claiming that Blasey lied, that she does teach people how to beat polygraphs, that sheís an expert at it. The boyfriendís letter has not been reported on by the Drive-By Media. A six-year ex-boyfriend of Blasey Ford basically said that most everything she said here is not true, and then he added (paraphrased), ìThe woman is a credit card fraudster to boot.ìShe continued to use my credit card even after I took her name off it after we broke up and continued to charge things. Oh, and she never had any fear of flying at all and that she never had any claustrophobia. She lived for a while in a very small apartment, 500 square feet. She didnít need a second door or any other remedy to get past the trauma of having been attacked by Kavanaugh.îHe said, ìNone of what sheís saying has she ever said to me. She never mentioned Kavanaughís name.î That letter that the boyfriend wrote has yet to be reported on by ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, MSNBC, Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, New York Times, Associated Press, USA Today, Pravda, Russia Today, the Algore News Network. None of íem have run a syllable of that story or of the attempt to get Leland Keyser to change her story.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: One other thing, again along the lines of what are the Democrats gonna do if Kavanaugh gets confirmed? I told you. Theyíre gonna double down and theyíre gonna keep harassing and theyíre not gonna stop trying to get rid of this guy. I have just a little bit of anecdotal evidence to back it up.I have a tweet here, actually two, from a woman who works at The Nation. She isÖ I donít know if sheís a journalist. I donít know what she does there. But The Nation is an uber-left magazine. Her tweetÖ Her name is Annie Shields. Iíll go ahead and make her famous. ìI am starting a National @DemSocialists working group to follow Jeff Flake around to every restaurant, cafe, store, etc. he goes to for the rest of his life and yell at him.îYou ought to see the mob outside Susan Collinsí office right now in the Senate building where her office is, and then Annie Shieldsí next tweet: ìIf they knew they would get yelled at for the rest of their lives maybe they would act right.î She sounds like everybodyís first ex-wife. ìIf they knew they would get yelled at for the rest of their lives maybe they would act right.î These people are gonna get houndedÖ I think theyíre gonna get hounded no matter what they do, if theyíre not Democrats, theyíre gonna get hounded no matter what they do.Man up.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/05/salena-zitos-analysis-of-the-trump-electorate/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 5, 2018RUSH: I got an email last night from Salena Zito, who has made a name for herself by traveling through all of these blue states during the election campaign season of 2016. She went to all of these places in blue states that were going to vote for Trump.And she learned everything about these people she could. She took them seriously. She went and met them and talked to them, learned about them. Nobody else in the Drive-By Media has done anything like this. But she wanted to find out who they are. She lives in Pittsburgh. She had a sense that something was happening out there that the Washington establishment didnít see, and rather than guess, she actually wanted to find out who these people are.She went to a lot of small towns, medium size towns, spent serious time there getting to know these people. She has stayed in touch with them ever since the election. She has written a book about it. If the Democrats and the media wanted to know who it is that voted for Donald Trump, all theyíd have to do is go get her book. They havenít. They donít read it. They donít care to know who the Trump voters are. Theyíre not interested in appealing to them.Theyíre trying to find out ways to make Trump voters irrelevant or keep them away from the polls. They want to separate Trump and his voters from themselves, but theyíre not interested in finding out who they are so as to maybe convert them to Never Trumpers or anti-Trumpers. Itís an amazing display of arrogance. And, by the way, the same can be said of Republican political consultants. They donít care who the Trump voters are. All that matters is that they are laughed at, impugned, and made fun of.So I get a note from her last night, and she is explaining to me what the Kavanaugh hearings have meant and what has happened out there in these areas she has studied. She made, essentially, two points. One, that something has needed to happen after the 2016 election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together. Now, a lot of us have assumed that if people voted for Trump in 2016, that they did so for very specific reasons, among them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment, that Trump is alone in pushing back against Democrats and the so-called Washington conventional wisdom.And then the assumption is that if people knew that in 2016, that they would not forget that and that they would realize the need to continue to vote in ways that would continue to support and enable Trump to be successful! And she makes the point that it doesnít work that way, sadly, that after a single election with the known result, something needs to happen besides just another election of party members where Trump is not on the ballot. Something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in 2016.And that is the Kavanaugh circumstance, in her mind. ìThe conservative-populist coalition that elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms.î In other words, in her study of things, just continuing to vote for a party ó Republicans ó to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get íem out there. I donít know why. I would think it would be. But she says itís not.ìKavanaugh, however, has provided the catalyst, because of how Trump voters ó and specifically the conservative-populist coalition ó perceive the way he has been treated. Not just by Democrats, but by the media and by Hollywood. That the Trump conservative-populist coalition is tired and worn out the way they and things they believe in are treated by Democrats, the media, and Hollywood. And her point is that the targets of rage had somewhat diminished until Kavanaugh came along and reawakened these people and fired them back up.So she says, ìThis is what I see in a nutshell: What happened to Kavanaugh has served as a reminder and a highlight to the people that voted for Trump, why heís successful, that itís all about being strong. It helped remind voters why they supported him. Any other Republican president would have walked away from Kavanaugh by now. Energy would have been lost. But itís not. Energy is high.îNow, again, thatís Salena Zito and her analysis of the electorate today heading into the 2018 midterms. Now, where IÖ Look, she knows what sheís talking about. I find it strange that people whoÖ I think the people that voted for Trump are deeply involved in things. Now, maybe there are some exceptions and you had some people that voted for Trump who were just fed up with Republicans and Democrats and found Trump interesting.But for the most part, I am of the opinion that Trump voters did so for very, very, very specific reasons related to Trumpís agenda, which he pounded every day, multiple times a day. Donald Trump told everybody was he was gonna do: Trade deals, the wall, immigration, rebuild the military, bring back the economy. I would think people that voted for Trump knew that thatís what heís gonna do, and I would also think that people voted for Trump would realize that he needed more than two years to do it.But itís her insistence, no, that kind of stuff; it evaporates and wanes.You know, peopleís lives go on, the news changes, but that this Kavanaugh circus ìhas reignited the coalition that elected Trump, and this is to the detriment of the Democrats who donít see this happening.î She says the Senate could indeed see a red wave. The House, sheís not so sure of. I found it interesting analysis, and I wanted to share it with you. She points out the Democrats spending money in House races out there like weíve never seen before, and the Republicans arenít.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I meant to mention something earlier in my sharing with you the information Salena Zito shared with me in an email last night about how the Kavanaugh situation has revitalized the Trump populist coalition. It was the Trump populist coalition that was assumed to be not all that enthusiastic about voting ícause they did that in 2016 and Trump won. But now Kavanaugh and this whole thing has reinvigorated íem.In her note to me, she said, ìThere could well be a red wave in the Senate. The House, itís too soon to say. The Democrats could win the House, Rush.î And she said, ìBecause theyíre spending money like you canít believe in these local races. The Republicans outraise them, but when you get into local district House races, the Republicans in many of these racesí districts are being dwarfed, and it made me stop and realize something.How many of youÖ? Let me just ask you something. How many of you have ever made up your mind on who to vote for based on a TV ad? I never have! Now, I donít watch local TV that much, but I know that I am not a good example of a cross section of the country. A lot of people watch local TV and, as such, are inundated with political ads. And we keep hearing that people are tired of them.But they keep running íem because the political consultants believe that they work. But this is an area where I donít have a lot in common with the people in this regard. And it leads to being a constant frustration for me. I am never influenced by the money spent on a campaign, particularly campaign ads. It doesnít affect me. I know who Iím gonna vote for before I see an ad. And thereís not an ad in the world thatís gonna make me the change my mind.But I have to keep in mind how rare that is. Most people watch local TV, they canít avoid all those ads, and a lot of people are not immersed in this stuff like I am and maybe you, too, and so they are influenced by these ads. I have to keep reminding mess that these ads and the spending of voluminous amounts of money does matter. I just have a tough time seeing how people who pay attention to things could even think about voting Democrat right now.Folks, I really mean it. I think, given what weíve seen since Trump was elected, the Democrat Party and the deep state deserve the biggest electoral landslide loss ever. This country needs to rise up and reject these people. I know their voters are not gonna reject íem, but I donít believe theyíre the majority. I think these people need to be skunked. Their behavior is, in terms of decency, common decency, these people must not be rewarded for what theyíre doing!Destroying people, destroying institutions, destroying concepts in our rule of law. I shudder to think of them being rewarded for this stuff. You know, it used to be that you knew the economy was great just by living through it. But now you apparently have to be told that itís good. You have to be watching TV and then somebody on TV has to tell you the economy is good, then you have to believe it.Well, I remember a time where when the economy was roaring along and people were doing well, you didnít need to be told. You knew it. But now weíve got the Democrat Party out there saying itís not a great economy, tax cuts are ruining everything. And some dummkopfs believe this stuff! You reject what youíre living and believe what youíre being told by people. So I just, I have yet to be influenced by a political ad.Now, I realize Iím very firm in my convictions, and I know what I believe, and thereís not an ad in the world thatís gonna change my mind about a candidate.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Also, the money Democrats are spending is being spent on people to go door-to-door to pretend to be neighbors and say, ìMan, we really like such-and-such.  You gotta join us.î They may be spending more on that than they are TV ads.    "

But literally seconds after I saw Kavanaughís opening statement, I went straight to register to vote.RUSH: You know, I find this fascinating. I always try to make it a point to understand that not everybody is into this like I am. I find it hard to do that sometimes because it seems that since all of this is about so much of how weíre going to live in this country, that I wish more people did pay attention to it and learned a little bit more about it, and itís one of the purposes for this show.

Itís hard to know scientifically or statistically. Thatís why we have to treat your conversion here as an anecdotal, one-time example. But I think the Democrats are worried about this. I really think that they constantly misjudge and believe that they represent the majority of thinking in this country. I think they really believe that a majority of Americans hate conservatives and everything about them and conservatism.And I think they think theyíre relating to a majority of Americans. When theyíre hit with the reality that that may not be the case ó and I think theyíre seeing that now ó then itís time to circle the wagons and try to limit the damage.

To me, sheís no different than the two ladies that confronted óRUSH: Oh, by the way, let me interrupt you. I need óCALLER: (crosstalk)RUSH: Hold it. Let me interrupt you. I need to remind people of one thing. Do you remember the letter written by the ex-boyfriend of six years claiming that she never talked about this, that she never had a fear of flying, that sheís not claustrophobic? None of the things she said is true and that she illegally used his credit card long after he took her name away. Do you remember that letter that was announced yesterday?CALLER: Yes.RUSH: Do you realize CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, New York Times, Washington Post have not reported it? Not a single network has reported it. Not a single newspaper, I donít believe, has published it or talked about it. Itís just itís totally on ice. Nobody knows that her ex-boyfriendÖ If you watch Drive-By Media, nobody knows about that ex-boyfriendís letter.CALLER: Oh, yeah, I was really surprised I didnít see it on ABC last night. You know, I was really shocked. You know, we know how that goes, Rush. Theyíre not gonna report anything that doesnít work in their narrative. And did not Dr. Ford perjure herself, if it could be proven that she indeed did coach or advise folks on how to pass a lie detector test, and she said in her testimony that she didnít óRUSH: Yeah. Thatís what the boyfriend said in the letter. And thatís why Ms. Mitchell, the Republican prosecutor, if you will, during the hearings last Thursday was zeroing in on her, I think to create the fact that she established that she was committing perjury. Yeah. So you think sheís getting off too easy here in this?CALLER: I do. I really do. If you watch her testimony or a recording of her testimony, it was full of holes. Not only the ones that were documented, but undocumented. When the prosecutor asked her about the encounter with Mark Judge, she said that during that six- to eight-week window before she saw Mark Judge at Safeco that they were friendly with each other. With that kind of behavior from a man like that, why would you ever be friendly with him? And Iím surprised that the prosecutor didnít push her on that, say, ìPlease explain those encounters that you say were friendly.î What could her answer have been with the óRUSH: Well óCALLER: ó remember óRUSH: (unintelligible)Ö Do this.CALLER: ó know why they were friendly, I donít remember.RUSH: But thatísÖ We now know in hindsight thatís not what the purpose of the prosecutor was. The prosecutor was documenting perjury, was documenting variances and differences in her story for perhaps some other use at some other time. I donít know. But itís clear that Blasey Ford was not going to be challenged on anything she said. She was going to be encouraged to say different things, tell different stories, as I say, for whatever purpose.CALLER: I see. That does makes sense. Just give her more rope. I understand that. It makes sense.RUSH: Give her more rope, but if you donít do anything with the rope, what good is that? I donít know how they intended to use it. I still think this. I think a lot of people agree with you, that this woman has gotten away and not been thoroughly investigated. She got away with an anonymous letter that she didnít want made public, supposedly. Does anybody really believe that, either? Does this woman act irritated that sheís been made to go public with this? She doesnít act irritated about that to me. She wants to be helpful while sheís terrified.I justÖ I think in this climate, to tell you the truth out there, Pat, to try to poke holes in her story and to succeed, if the Republicans had succeeded in exposing her as a liar, I think the Democrats would have lost it. I think they would have gone batty, at the Republicans. Not at her. I think they would have accused the Republicans of browbeating her and making her say different things because theyíre all on record as having said they believed her before they even met her.Before they even talked to her. They said they believed her. In fact, I donít even know why the Democrats need to see the FBI report! Because theyíve said they believe her from the get-go. Theyíre not even open to the possibility that sheís telling a story that cannot be corroborated and hasnít been. This is Louis in Los Angeles as we stay with the phones. Hi, Louis. Great to have you here. Hello.CALLER: Hey. How you doing, Rush? This is my first year listening. I started listening to you, Sean Hannity, everybody, and I just want to thank you for basically yelling what I want to yell out so loud all the time. You know, you guys say it, and Iím thinking it, and my first yearÖ Iíve never really been into politics, Iíve never really cared, in the sense of just kind of like, hey, theyíre just gonna vote, whatever. But this was really bad. This was something that changed peopleís minds.I have a lot of sons, I have a big family, and it was like: How can you just try and destroy someone with no kind of corroboration, no kind of proof, no kind of evidence? And then Trump said it yesterday and Iíll say it like this. He basically yelled out what I said. It was like, everything she was saying was, I donít know, well, I donít know, I donít know, I donít know. So itís like, well, what happened? What went down? Whatís going on here?Youíre saying these allegations, but you donít know certain things that are very important, like who took you home. This should have been traumatizing for you. If something like that happened you would have been like, hey, Mom, pick me up, hey, call somebody, get to a pay phone. Something. So, just after that, just how they destroyed that man and tried toÖ It just changed me. And basically it was just like, ìI gotta vote. I gotta vote for our rights. I gotta vote for conservatism, for justice, God, our values in this country, which are being torn apart.RUSH: Really? This has awakened you that much?CALLER: Yes. You know, not that women canít be believed, but, folks, men and women can lie. To say that, oh, a certain nobody canít lie, a woman canítÖRUSH: No, no. You said it earlier. You nailed what this is about earlier. You correctly identified that the United States Senate was attempting to destroy this guy.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: You didnít know who he was from pile of coal. But you saw a guy trying to be destroyed, his life, his career, his future destroyed, and nobody had any corroborating evidence for all of this that was gonna destroy him! Thatís what got you in gear.CALLER: Yeah. Itís the same thing like the gentleman before. I went out and saidÖ I was even talking to me wife, we watched it together. Sheís like, ìWait a minute. Like, it just did not add up. Iím sorry.î When two plus two is four and this was like two plus, you know, something else. It wasnítÖ You know what I mean? It just didnít add up, the story óRUSH: All right. Here we haveÖ Louis, thanks for the call. Weíve got another anecdotal story, but it dovetails with what weíre seeing in the polling data. Weíre seeing the generic ballot advantage the Democrats had now gone in the latest Marist/NPR poll. Weíve got a 12-point advantage is now two points, which is statistically tied. Thatís the margin of error. In all these other generic ballot polls, which I think areÖI donít think the Republicans have ever led in one of these, and the Republicans win Congress all the time. Since 1994, anyway. Do you people realize when the Republicans won in í94 it was the first time in 40 years that they ran or controlled the House? Since then, theyíve lost control and want control back. But I donít think thereís ever been a generic ballot poll ever that shows the Republicans ahead! I could be wrong. I doubt it. I donít recall ever having seen one. But now weíre seeing voter enthusiasm shifts to the Republicans.Democrats are losing some. And, believe me, if this all is real, if this polling dataís accurate, if itís the same stuff the Democrats are seeing, itís affecting them. Then thereís this from The Atlantic. Now, The Atlantic is a left-wing publication, as is most U.S. media. The headline of this story: ìConservative Women Are Angry About Kavanaugh ó And They Think Other Voters Are, Too.î Hereís a pull quote: ìIn the two weeks since the claims against Kavanaugh first emerged, many feminist groups have called on senators and the American public to believe women who come forward with allegations.ìKamala Harris, the progressive Democrat senator from California, captured this sentiment when she questioned Ford during the hearing, ëI believe you. And I believe many Americans across the country believe you.'î But the writer of this story, whose name is Emma Green, said, ìThe women I interviewed, however, resented the notion that peopleís accusations should be believed on the basis of their identity alone.îìëThat makes me furious, because I think thatís taking advantage for the worst purposes of something that is real in our culture,í [a woman] said, ëWomen are not a monolithic bloc. Most of us Ö (are) not going to take to the streets with pitchforks and torchesÖ That said, thereís a large, large percentage of us who feel very, very strongly about the way this process has played out.'î Headline: ìConservative Women Are Angry About Kavanaugh ó And They Think Other Voters Are, Too.î Do conservative women live in suburbs?The reason I ask that is because the Democrats claim to have a hold on college-educated suburban women. Well, they may be losing that hold too, if some of this polling data is correct. Let me just say this. If everything were just, and it isnít, and I know it. But if everything were sane, the Democrats would be destroying themselves right now, as they did back in 2002 when they did the Wellstone memorial.The Democrat Party is, in a sane world, the Democrat Party is engaging in self-immolation right now with the treatment of Kavanaugh, the backing of a woman whoís got no evidence, hasnít had any evidence corroborated. And thanks to Donald Trump now, more Americans than ever know the truth of her story. And the truth of her story is that itís full of holes! If Trump hadnít went on his rant, gone on his rant on Monday night, the Drive-Bys would have never reported that because they had not reported it.Democrats are not the majority. They did not win the Senate. They did not win the House. The advice and consent role does not give them the right to determine who goes on the court and who doesnít. Thatís for the winners! But the behavior the Democrats have engaged in here, the public political murder of a highly achieved, brilliant guy who never did anything to anybody anywhere near the way heís being described. People bringing forth BS allegations like this with BS lies and no evidence to back it up in, a sane world would be paying a price so high, they wouldnít even engage in this kind of behavior.But the Democrats think they speak for a majority of Americans because they have the media on their side. And they think that they have succeeded in making the majority of Americans hate Brett Kavanaugh and hate conservatives and Republicans as well. Well, we donít live in a sane world. We donít live in a sane country right now. But itís still possible for the Democrats to pay a huge, huge price for this. Given the standard, time-tested American moral code and our sense and set of values, the Democrats should be halfway finished with their self-destruction in the middle of this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Back to the phones! To Lake Mary, Florida. This is Paula. Great to have you with us. Youíre up. Youíre next. Hello.CALLER: Hi! Thank you, Rush, and thanks to your staff as well for all that you guys do. I justÖ This is really coincidental, but I just happened to have been watching a report on Fox this morning and Steny Hoyer made a comment about how the Democrat voters are all hyped up and theyíre excited and theyíre coming out en masse to vote. And then thereís reports about, ìYeah, the Republicans are kind of excited, too. But, you know, weíre not really worried about that.î And all I could think of isÖ Now taking into consideration I was a sex abuse victim years and years ago ó as a child, as a matter of fact ó women that Iíve talked to, people Iíve talked to are so fired up and the majority of the fired up people are women who have been either sexually abused or assaulted at some point in their lives óRUSH: Do they have sons?CALLER: (crosstalk)RUSH: Do they have sons? Are they married? Do they have men in their lives they love?CALLER: Oh, absolutely. Iíve got a daughter, but the injustice of whatís been done to this man under the falsehood of sexual abuse ó and thatís not even whatís making women and other people angry but women in particular. Itís the fact that you would do something to an innocent person under the guise of one of the most horrific crimes in the world and think that weíre buying what youíre selling. And everythingÖ Having been a victim, keeping this in mind óRUSH: Now, that is interesting. The women you know are insulted. Their intelligence is insulted to think that a woman can come across with a 36-year-old story and destroy a guy because youíre stupid enough to go along with it?CALLER: Absolutely! Thatís it.RUSH: Thatís an interesting take: An insult to the intelligence. Other people may have portrayed it that way, but that connects with me. That makes total sense to me. This idea that women are monolithic and all women are gonna have the same opinion, the same rage, the same anger simply because the Democrat Party brings one forward whoís got these baseless claims that women are so universal. Excellent point. Iím glad you called, Paula. Iím sorry I ran out of time, but I have. Itís great to talk to you. Thank you very much.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Dina in Wilburn, Georgia, youíre next. Welcome to the EIB Network. Hi.CALLER: Hi.RUSH: Hey.CALLER: The reason Iím calling is because I believe that if the Democrats keep complaining that the investigation, the FBI investigation is not thorough enough, that they may be right. The investigation needs to investigate Dr. Ford. The reason being is that we donít know anything about Dr. Ford. Was she taking drugs, by any chance?RUSH: We do too! The Democrats believe her. Thatís all anybody would need to know.CALLER: Well, was she taking drugs? Has she ever done this before? What are her affiliations with Democratic Party and Democratic members, big-time members? Also, thereís two people who are on the scene, and thatís her and Kavanaugh. One of them is lying. One of them is committing perjury. We know nothing about her, and we need to know more about her, if they keep complaining about this. We know everything we need to know about Kavanaugh. Heís had 150 people talk to seven investigations and nothing about her.RUSH: I canít dispute any of that. In fact, thatís a great point. That is an absolutely great point. We donít know a thing about her. Nobodyís investigating her because the Democrats say that you have to believe her, Dina.CALLER: We can, but was she on drugs? I mean, you know, whatís going on here? You know, thereís all kinds of things óRUSH: Whatís going on here is here trying to railroad a guy so that they donít lose control of the Supreme Court, in their mind!CALLER: I know, but nobody is responding to them appropriately, which means you gotta put it back on them, you know?RUSH: Well óCALLER: You want an investigation? Investigate Ford! We donít know anything.RUSH: I agree with that, but the one big response throwing it right back at them will be the vote to confirm. I mean, that will be the gigantic avocado theyíve gotta swallow without any butter or mayonnaise. "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/04/npr-generic-ballot-in-dead-heat-because-of-kavanaugh-and-me/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 4, 2018RUSH: Everything that we predicted is coming to pass on the Democrat side. Now, as to the blue wave, purple wave, red wave, and this kind of thing, NPR has a poll out there. ìJust over a month away from critical elections across the [fruited plain], the wide Democratic enthusiasm advantage that has defined the 2018 campaign up to this point has disappeared, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll.îNow, for this to be true then it also has to be true that the previous polls were accurate. What did you tell me before the program, that Cruz is now up seven or Beto OíRourke and thatÖ? (interruption) You seem surprised by that. Why? (interruption) Two or three weeks ago, Cruz was tied with Beto OíRourke. What if they never were tied? What if that was just polling data flimflam? What if that was nothing more than polling data flummery? What if Cruz never has trailed? You know my theory about polling.They use it to shape public opinion, and you get close to the election, they have to start changing it to have it close to accurate so that when the electionís over, theyíre not totally discredited. None of this polling data surprises me. I have never thought the Democrats had a 12-point advantage in the generic ballot in House races but everybody goes with it ícause thatís the only polling data you have. The point is in the NPR poll, NPR/Marist/PBS NewsHour, the Democrat generic ballot advantage has gone from 12% to 2%.Thatís in the margin of error. That is a wash. The Democrats have lost two points in this poll, and it is related to Kavanaugh. There is a backlash happening against Kavanaugh. There is a backlash happening against the behavior of the Democrats. But more importantly, a backlash against these really insane, lunatic protester supporters they have harassing people, doxing people. A former intern for Sheila Jackson Lee and Feinstein and one otherÖ This guy, heís 27 years old, and he works for all women.Heís the guy that revealed all the public information ó names, addresses, phone numbers ó of Republican senators so that protesters could harass them. And the protesters did indeed harass them. One of them even showed up and beat up Rand Paul in his front door, attacking him from the rear. Well, letís go to the audio sound bites on this NPR business. Weíll start here at the top, No. 1.NPR is back translating me for their audience. This is last night, All Things Considered, a portion of a report by the NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith about Trumpís comments expressing concerns about allegations of sexual harassment and assault against Kavanaugh and other men. And Iíve got a point about that to make again. Here we go.RUSH ARCHIVE: I think itís hatred of men, and I said this!KEITH: Rush Limbaugh has been railing against so-called feminazis for decades to much commercial success.RUSH ARCHIVE: Weíre so out of balance here. Women ó activist, feminazi women ó can demand all kinds of investigations into men. Men cannot require or demand investigations into women. Can you imagine if somebody tried that?KEITH: That was from his show today.RUSH ARCHIVE: Men are under investigation in this country, be it through Kavanaugh or through Trump or whoever.KEITH: The idea being that men are under siege, as women have taken more prominent roles in the workplace, as demographic and cultural shifts have changed the rules.RUSH: So next, they went over to Frank Luntz, the king of focus group research, to ask and have him explain how and why all of this is firing up the GOP base.KEITH: Itís something President Trump tapped into as a candidate with his talk of forgotten men and political correctness run amok, says Frank Luntz.LUNTZ: Ö the idea that you canít say things that you believe to be true, that you canít think the way you once thought 10 or 20 years ago because thereís something wrong with itÖKEITH: And now as Trump tweeted today there is an anger among some at how Kavanaugh has been treated. Luntz notes that partisans seek to gain advantage from the open wound that was the Kavanaugh hearing.LUNTZ: It has been used by some to try to energize the white, conservative male to say, ìHey look. Now, youíre the victim.îRUSH: Okay. So hereís NPR doing a report, starting out railing against me and my comments, predictions about feminazis. And then they go to Frank Luntz, and Frank Luntz explains to them why there might be a little backlash occurring, not just among men but among people on the right in general. And now here is the payoff. NPR went out, they polled it themselves, and the found that exactly what I have been saying has come to pass. The Kavanaugh hearings are backfiring big time to the Democrats.KEITH: An NPR/PBS NewsHour Marist poll out today found a big swing in public opinion among men following the hearing, with a 10-point increase in those saying they plan to support a Republican candidate in the upcoming midterm elections.RUSH: Right. So this is happening, and the only primary change or difference here has been the Kavanaugh hearings and the leftís reaction to it. Iíve even seen stories today among Never Trumper conservatives that this whole thing may actually reunite the conservative movement. Well, we will see about that. But clearly there is a reaction to it, and itís root level simple. This is so easily understood. It is the worst smear campaign many people have ever seen in their lives. Many peopleÖYou know, even as Lindsey Graham found out the other day there are a lot of people today that have no idea that Hillary Clinton ran an operation to destroy women who surfaced saying that her husband, Bill Clinton, had abused them or raped them or mistreated them or what have you. Lindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said, ìWhen you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park,î and he got booed because the Millennials in the crowd had no idea that thatís who Hillary Clinton was.By the same token, those people have not lived through Robert Bork, and many of them were not old enough to remember what happened with Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill. So this was their first, and that means it is the worst smear campaign ever that theyíve seen. Could anyone be smeared more? Can anybody be smeared more than Brett Kavanaugh has been smeared? We think that it canít get worse, but the left will always make it worse.Kavanaugh has been smeared unlike anybody since Clarence Thomas, but heís been vindicated too. Heís vindicated by facts. Heís been vindicated by evidence. Heís been vindicated by witness corroboration. Seven different FBI investigations! He is vindicated by a life well lived. When you boil all this down, I think itís gonna be really hard for any Republican to vote against the guy.In fact, I donít know this, but I wouldnít be surprised if some Democrats, Senate Democrats are privately, behind the scenes, urging recalcitrant Republicans to go ahead and vote for Kavanaugh ícause the way this is backfiring on íem. Donít know that. Itís a wild guess, and only time will tell when we get to the vote. But the FBI investigation that the Democrats wanted appears to have provided cover for both Susan Collins and Jeff Flake. We donít know where Murkowski is on any of this yet. And of course, there are some red state Democrat senators that now have a big decision to make.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/04/democrats-sense-theyve-lost-on-kavanaugh/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 4, 2018RUSH: So the FBI report was delivered to Chuck Grassley. Grassley said, ìHey, thereís nothing new in this. Everything in this we knew,î which is eminently predictable. They still havenítÖ The FBI was unable to corroborate anything any of the witnesses have said, folks, any of the allegations that witnesses have made. They havenít been able to corroborate Blasey Fordís testimony. They werenít able to corroborate Ramirez. They werenít able to corroborate Swetnick. They werenít able to corroborate any of it.This is now the seventh FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh and the left is out there saying, ìBut they didnít talk to Dr. Ford and they didnít talk to Kavanaugh!î Thatís right. Thatís not part of the deal. They testified under oath! What more can the FBI learn? Do you think the FBI really thinks that these people are gonna change their stories from what they testified to under oath? Besides that, Dr. Fordís testimony changed anyway in terms of the timeline.But the reason the FBI didnít talk to Ford or Kavanaugh is ícause theyíve talked to Kavanaugh for how many times over how many years? But they testified under oath. And so the thinking is thereís no reason to talk to them. You go out and talk to people they claim can corroborate what theyíre saying. The FBI couldnít find any. So Iím watching CNN today. Iíve got CNN and Fox on here, and it was probably 10 minutes ago, 10 minutes before the program started, and I began to get the impression that the Democrats think theyíve lost.Because a little CNN reporter (well, he looks little to me) was describing Jeff Flake. Jeff Flake said, ìThis is very thorough. This investigationís very, very satisfying to me.î And the CNN reporter said, ìJeff Flake today actually sounded like a Republican, and that presents a problem. Jeff Flake is sounding like a Republican. Last Friday, he sounded like a Democrat but today heís sounding like a Republican.î Then he went to Susan Collins. Susan Collins says, ìHey, you know, I look at this and Iím very satisfied.ìThis is a very thorough report and investigation.î So it looks like Flake and Collins are in line. Vote has been called. Cloture vote was filed last night by the turtle who was on fire again today just moments ago on the floor of the Senate. For him, he was on fire. We have the audio sound bites of this coming up. Iím stale waiting for James Comey. Has anybody heard from James Comey praising the FBI on their investigation here?You know another way we know this is over? Trump-Russia collusion news is back. Yeah. YesterdayÖ (chuckling) Yesterday there was some other story that surfaced. Oh, Trumpís tax returns! Trumpís tax returns. That told me that the Drive-Bys thought they were near the end of their abilities on Kavanaugh.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Iíve got Feinstein and Schumer at the microphones. The funny thing to me is SchumerÖ (laughing) Schumer didnít hang around for questions. He wanted to make three points. Feinsteinís out there talking, and Chuck Schumerís chomping at the bit standing right next to her. He just wants to sweep her off the stage, get to the microphones, say what he wants to say, and get out of there. You know what point he tried to make?ëCause McConnell, the Turtle, during his floor speech today really chastised the Democrats for knees needless details. And Schumer said (haltingly), ìWe didnít delay, Madam President. We didnít delay. Any delay that has happened here has been because either the chairman of the committee or the leader of the Republicans has wanted a delay. But weíre not responsible, because we donít run the committee and we donít run the Senate and so we canít have been responsible for any delay.îOf course, they are responsible for the delay. Ultimately, Schumerís right. I mean, the Republicans could have told them to go pound sand each and every time that they demanded another week. But everythingís falling into place. Everything as predicted. We predicted that the Democrats wouldnít be satisfied with what they asked for. They asked for an additional week of FBI investigation; they got it. Immediately after getting it, they said a week wouldnít be long enough. Then we predicted that whatever the FBI comes back and says, the Democrats are gonna say itís tainted because they didnít do a thorough enough investigation.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: An NPR reporter just tweeted that Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats are ìall filing out of Schumerís office. All stone faced.î The meaning is theyíre coming out and theyíre depressed. There are no expressions on their faces. Theyíre not happy. Theyíre ìstone faced.î Theyíre shell-shocked. Theyíre something or other. Now, why would that be? Why? Well, did the Democrats on that committee actually believe Christine Blasey Ford? Did they really believe what she was saying? See, I donít know how anybody could.Honestly, folks, withoutÖ Iím not even being partisan when I say this. She canít remember where, when, why. The people she says were there werenít there, and yet these Democrats all believe her? Further, did the Democrats in that committee really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days was going to somehow produce corroborating evidence that would wipe out the Kavanaugh nomination? They really thought that? Because my thinking all along has been theyíve known that this is nothing other than delay.This is all this has been. Itís all theyíve got. If they really thought that this FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations and countless other interviews and written questions hadnít produced, well, that is shocking. Honest to God. I know Iím sometimes naive, but I thought this has been a scam from the get-go and that theyíre all in on the scam and that the scam was delay. Hence, the late release of Dr. Fordís letter detailing all of this.So they walk out of Schumerís office, and theyíre all ìstone faced.î Maybe they thought that they had Flake, and maybe they thought they were gonna get Collins. But Collins and Flake have come out and what they have said so farÖ Remember, the voteís not gonna be ítil Saturday now. So anything can change. Do not think the Democrats have scraped the bottom of the barrel or the gutter in efforts to thwart this. Theyíve still got ítil Saturday. But they walk out of there ìstone faced.î Maybe they actually thought they were gonna stop this with an additional FBI investigation.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  As we knew would happen, the FBI report has begun to leak now, And we find out that the FBI really focused on the last five days on just the latest allegations that had come forward, which makes sense.  Everything prior to that had already been vetted, and it turns out that they did interview Mark Judge for three hours.  Some in the media were saying that the FBI wasnít even gonna try to talk to Mark Judge.  He is the guy that the Democrats on the committee thought they could turn.  They thought they could get to Mark Judge and get him to admit that he and Kavanaugh did indeed do whatever they supposedly did to Blasey Ford.  They interviewed him for three hours.  He did not corroborate anything she said.  They talked to Ramirez, but sheís upset they didnít talk to her enough.  They talked to people over the last few days regarding I think something like five or six of the most recent allegations.  They found nothing corroborating.  Their report goes up to the Senate, and a lot of Republicans look at it and think, ìMan, this is really thorough, because of the people that were talked to, the people that were interviewed.î  And there wasnít anything corroborating!  There wasnít a thing.  I still havenít heard from James Comey praising this particular FBI investigation.  Weíre still waiting for that.  We have the news that the Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats walked out of Senator Schumerís office ìstone faced.î  Maybe he had polling data for íem!  Maybe he showed íem the NPR poll.  Maybe he showed íem some Democrat internal polling.  This isnít working out the way the Democrats had planned!  You know, they live and die by their own polling!  They believe it.  Itís a Bible to them.  Even to the extent that they know how itís rigged and used.  They believe it, because they believe polling is always done in their favor.  And to see this generic ballot advantage vanish in a Marist poll with NPR?  To go from plus 12 to plus 2, which is statistical margin of error?They have been, in their mindsÖ And this is crucial to understand it. In their minds, they have been running the House.  Itís all but formal.  All we need is to have the election.  Pelosi is telling herself sheís speaker again.  Sheís out there telling everybody sheís gonna be speaker.  Every other Democrat thinks theyíre gonna run the House.  Itís just a matter of time passing.  Just like, just a matter of time, just gotta get to the election, the election day itself, and Hillary Clintonís gonna be president.  Theyíre in the same mind-set again.  And then theyíre brought into Schumerís office, and they see something that conflicts with this wonderful story theyíve been telling themselves, and they walk out stone faced.  Itís also possible the stone face is an act.  Itís also stone faced is an act designed to create a certain false reaction amongst observers watching.  But I donít know.  In this case, I think theyíve been so convinced that they were gonna get rid of Kavanaugh when they got that one week additional FBI investigation. I think that alone they thought was gonna make sure that Collins and Flake did not vote for Kavanaugh, maybe Murkowski.  And if that could happen, then they wouldnít need any of their red state Democrats to vote for Kavanaugh, be at risk, but it looks like thereís this pretty big backlash out there against Democrats.  And now guess what?  Thereís this massive protest going on at the U.S. District Court, the court of appeals where Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge, a massive anti-Kavanaugh protest.  And guess who one of the leaders of it is? Does the name Linda Sarsour ring a bell?  Linda Sarsour is a PLO activist in the United States.  She is a far left activist.  She dabbles in womenís rights as well and sheís one of the leaders.  I think Norman Lear is there and some other celebrities.  But itís not gonna be doing them any good to have a PLO activist appearing to lead this protest against Kavanaugh.    "

For those of you watching on the Dittocam, I want to show you something. For those of you not watching on the Dittocam, weíre gonna post what Iím gonna show on the Dittocam at RushLimbaugh.com. Youíll be able to see it there. But first, before I show you thisÖ There are two cartoons I want to show you. Scott, grab the cartoon of the fireman carrying the baby and put it in the switcher. Letís use that one first. Go ahead and take that one live.This cartoon, ladies and gentlemen, was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City Bombing, after President Clinton said that ìangry voices on the rightî were speaking out against him. There was only one voice on the right. In 1995, I was it. There were some local talk shows, but CNNís the only cable out there. Thereís no Fox News. Thereís no blogosphere. Thereís no alternative media. There arenít really any conservative websites.Everythingís starting to blossom at that point, but this program nationally was still it four years after our founding. Clinton had blamed ìangry voices on the rightî for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the building in Oklahoma City, the federal building. Of course, I was livid. I was not gonna accept that. We challenged the White House on it, and they issued a ìcorrection,î claiming, ìNo, we were talking about the Michigan militia short-wave radio.îMichigan militia short-wave radio?ìYeah, Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan militia short-wave radio!îBy the way, this is more evidence of why you should have no doubt I know what Iím talking about here. I have been subjecting to this liberal machine and the way it operates a number of times. I know them. I know how they lie and make things up and strategize. I know their techniques, their strategies and everything better than they do. So a cartoonist by the name of Chris Britt, I think was his name, drew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead baby.There was actually a cover of TIME magazine. This picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on TIME magazine. This artist did his cartoonish interpretation of it, and the fireman is thinking as heís carrying the dead baby, ìDamn right-wing radio.î Well, one of the local hosts at the time, John Carlson, on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman and had him on the air. He wanted to know if thatís what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties at the Oklahoma City Bombing.The fireman said, ìNo, no, no, no. We all love Rush Limbaugh. We listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse.î Well, that cartoonist is back. Do you remember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his 10-year-old daughter was praying, suggested the family pray for ìthe woman,î meaning Dr. Ford. Judge Kavanaugh was starting to break down and tear up at that point, talking about the wisdom of his 10-year-old daughter.The same cartoonist is back in some publication, the Illinois something, Illinois Journal or some such thing. The cartoon has now gone viral all over the web and on Twitter and some parts Facebook they love it. Switch that. Show that to people watching on the Dittocam. This is the cartoon. It has Kavanaughís daughter praying at her bedside. The description in the upper left-hand corner: ìKavanaughís Daughter Says Another Prayer.îIn the speech bubble in the cartoon, Kavanaughís daughter says, ìDear God, forgive my angry, lying, alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr. Ford.î Now, as I say, if youíre not watching the program on the Dittocam ó which you can do as a member at RushLimbaugh.com ó weíll have the cartoon eventually at RushLimbaugh.com. You donít have to be a member. You donít have to to see it. Iím not doing this as a come-on for membership. We have the ability to show these things rather than describe them.Itís the same cartoonist, 1995 to today. Itís just vile. Itís filthy. Itís dirty. Itís disgusting. Itís despicable. And itís sick. And, of course, it has accomplished its objective! Itís gone viral, and people have seen it. People are reacting to it. I weighed whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets, and I decided to go ahead and do it. In my never-ending quest to have people understand who liberals are ó how sick and demented they are ó this is what passes for humor on the left.This is what passes for comedy. This is the kind of stuff that makes sure they laugh. ìKavanaughís Daughter Says Another Prayer: ëDear God, forgive my angry, lying, alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr. Ford.'î Not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true, and itís justÖ It flies in the face of decency. You know, you run out of descriptive adjectives when trying to describe this kind of thing.Itís why I have settled on the fact that weíre really dealing with a bunch of people who, at some point in their lives, have suffered psychological events that have led to psychological disorders, and they found themselves now at the mainstream of the Democrat Party and the American left. Psychological disorders have become the identifying issues and characteristics of this party, and they are attempting to become the majority on the basis of these psychological disorders, which are always somebody elseís fault!The disorders they suffer are simply said to be their political positions, and their anger is at the country or specific groups, like (summarized) ìwhite men who need to die so that feminists can castrate the corpses and feed them to pigs.î Thatís Georgetown University professor Dr. Christine Fair. These people are clearly not all there. Okay. You can now take that off of the switcher and return me to the Dittocam.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/02/kavanaugh-smear-on-thin-ice-backfiring-on-democrats/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 2, 2018RUSH: Now letís go to further news that buttresses some of this. From TheHill.com: ìRed State Democrats Face Nightmare Scenario on Kavanaugh.î This article shows beyond a doubt the Democrats have brought up all of these unfounded sexual allegations and now KavanaughÖ Do you realize the latest defense? The New York Times has run a story saying that Brett Kavanaugh threw ice on a fellow bar patron back in his days at Yale. (paraphrased) ìHe threw ice! This goes to show just how unfit to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is.Of course, the New York Times when learning that Bill Clinton told Juanita Broaddrick, ìPut a little ice on your lip,î while walking out of the room after allegedly raping her, they thought that was not worthy of being published or printed. There wasnít enough to that. ìI mean, put some ice on that lip, babeî? Ah, no news there! But Kavanaugh throwing ice, allegedly, on a bar patron? ìStop the presses! The guy is evil. He is not qualified.î So all these unfounded sexual allegations, they hope ultimately will work. What all this has been about is theyíre hoping to force Kavanaugh to drop out.Thatís what they haveÖ Just like the Mueller investigation. The Mueller investigation was designed to depress Trumpís approval numbers so that Trump would have to resign because of total loss of support in Washington by Republicans. If they could get his approval numbers down to the twenties because they succeeded in making everybody think that Trump cheated with the Russians, then Trump would lose all support (as Nixon did in the Watergate era) and have to resign. That was the objective.Because thereís no way they were gonna impeach Trump. There no way the Mueller investigation is gonna lead to Trump being indicted. The only hope they had was to drive public approval for Trump way down to twenties and be done with him. What theyíre trying to do here is force Kavanaugh to resign from the nomination, withdraw, or to force Trump to withdraw. That and delay. They still hope that they can force Kavanaugh out. ìA second DemocratÖî This from the article here at TheHill.com.ìA second Democratic senator said thereís widespread disbelief in the caucus that Kavanaugh is holding on. ëI just had a conversation with a colleague who said they couldnít believe he hasnít dropped out yet,í the second lawmaker said Monday evening.î Thatís a quote from an unnamed senator in the story at TheHill.com. This isnít going well. David French at National Review, a Never Trumper ó maybe the leader of the Never Trumpers ó nevertheless has a piece claiming the Kavanaugh case is collapsing.ìThe Case Against Kavanaugh Is Collapsing,î because the witnesses donít have any evidence! Theyíve got no proof of anything! Swetnick? Ramirez? Ford? Add it all up and thereís zero corroboration ó and one of these women appears to be not all there. The Swetnick babeÖ Details forthcoming. So hoping Kavanaugh would withdraw ó hoping Trump would pull the nomination ó has been one of the objectives here, along with delay, delay, delay.The story from TheHill.com: ìSenate Democrats up for reelection this year in deep-red states face a nightmare decision on how to handle Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Vulnerable Democrats are hoping Republicans will force him to withdraw his nomination, allowing them to avoid politically divisive votes.î This an important point. It has not been stressed enough. The Democrats thought that by running with every disgusting allegation they could find no matter how unsubstantiated, they would be able to force Kavanaugh to drop out or force Trump to withdraw his name.It hasnít worked.Kavanaugh wonít cave, and the number of arrows they have in their quiver is dwindling. ìThe Democrats in the toughest position are Sens. Heidi Heitkamp (North Dakota), Joe Donnelly (Indiana) and Joe Manchin (West Virginia). Heitkamp and Manchin are undecided, and both are seeking another six-year term in states that Trump won by double digits in 2016.î Iím back to the crowds that Trump is drawing: 92,000 requests for tickets Johnson City, Tennessee, and 20,000 people show up.People line up two days in advance to hope to get in. It kind of flies in the face of Trumpís losing his luster out there. So Donnelly, Heitkamp, Manchin. Now, you might say, well, equalize Susan Collins? Susan Collins is saying, ìI ó I ó I want the FBI to investigate the gang rape allegation.î They have been! The babe Swetnick isÖ Sheís not withdrawing it but sheís saying, ìWell, maybe Kavanaugh wasnít raping. He was standing outside. This is too big a coincidence.îSo sheís pulling back on the allegation that he started and organized and then participated in the gang rapes. What more do you need, Ms. Collins? She doesnít have any evidence! Sheís backing off of it. Avenattiís doing damage control now. ìMissouri Sen. Claire McCaskill Falls Behind GOP Opponent After Opposing Kavanaugh.îPolling data doesnít suggest any of this is gonna happen. Republican candidate in Missouri, Josh Hawley leads. McCaskill is now far behind. One poll shows her far behind Hawley. ìAccording to The Federalist, the new poll by Remington Research Group Ö ë48% said they were planning to vote for Ö Hawley while 46% said they planned to vote for McCaskill.'î That is way below how McCaskill has been performing.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The Drive-By Media, ladies and gentlemen, continuing to trying to make this investigation thatís supposed to be over in a week as confusing as possible. President Trump said back on Friday that he was leaving all this to the Senate. Totally backed away from it.Itís their problem, their issue. Let them handle it. But now the New York Times and the Washington Post, the rest of the Drive-Bys are claiming the White House is calling the shots behind the scenes and expanding the scope of the FBIís inquiry. Made this point yesterday. New York Times could not wait to run the story, White House expanding inquiry. It came the same day we had a leak from Fox News that the FBI said theyíre ready to wrap up today. A lot of people reacting to that, by the way.Now, I have an article here at TheHill.com that says the White House is denying everything. Theyíre denying that theyíre calling the shots, and theyíre denying expanding the scope. Trump did not expand the scope. He simply reacted at a rally to what the media is saying. He got a little suckered in by NBC News reporting a bunch of fake news that the White House was limiting the scope. Trumpís, ìIím not limiting anything.î That became, ìWhite House expands scope,î which is what the Democrats want. A whole bunch of fake news in this that we will straighten out today.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: From Breitbart News: Mazie Hirono, senator for Hawaii: ìFBI Needs to Investigate if Kavanaugh Was a Very Belligerent, Aggressive Drunk.î Andrea Mitchell, NBC News, Washington, says ìSen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) said the expanded FBI investigation into Supreme Court associate justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh should include whether Kavanaugh was ëa very belligerent, aggressive drunkí in his youth.'î Of course, weíre supposed to ignore that Obama was a practicing, bragging-rights member of ìthe Choom Gangî when he was in school.You know what the Choom Gang was; right?It was a bunch of people got together to blow a little weed, passing the Doobies around. That was cool, see? Yeah, that was all cool ícause Obamaís cool. So whatever Obama did, that was cool. Ted Kennedy and Bill Clinton, you know? All that stuff? No, none of what they did disqualifies them because they were lions of the Democrat Party. So now theyíre focusing on him being ìa very belligerent drunk,î throwing ice. Dianne Feinstein is saying, ìWe need to reexamine his positions on womenís reproductive health and assault weapons.îBREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, Trump just left the White House. He was on the lawn on the way to the helicopter. He stopped and talked to the press, as he always does. CNN focused on one thing that Trump said, and then Trump said, ìWell, yeah, if Kavanaugh is discovered to have lied to the committee, yeah, then heís done. Thatís not news. But the pressÖ Trump said much else, but thatís all they focused on which, of course is a no-brainer. So now theyíre out trying to find where Kavanaughís committed perjury and thatís why theyíre focusing on belligerent drunkenness and throwing ice at people and so forth.But (sigh) all these background checks of Kavanaugh has undergone over him the years? Theyíve got a dry hole, and they know it. What else did Trump say? Trump said to the press that he is blown away by all the support for Kavanaugh at all of these rallies, and he gave a shout-out to his buddy Lindsey Graham. Heís been his real close buddy since McCain passed away. Lindsey Graham isÖ Heís not a new guy, but heís definitely changed direction, changing tack in a very great way.But Trump made it clear that heís upbeat and positive about Kavanaugh, thinks heís gonna get confirmed, waiting for the investigative report, doesnít want to interrupt the process. But he made the point of talking about how popular Kavanaugh is at all of these rallies. I tuned in and I just happened to see Gloria Borger at CNN talking about this in a very worried tone. She said, ìYes, Trump is right, and this is amazing. All of these Republicans showing up are really fired up for Kavanaugh.îNow, the reason why thatís a big deal, folks, is because these people in the mediaÖ Do not doubt me. They think theyíre talking you out of Kavanaugh. Schumer, he made a speech on the floor of the Senate following McConnell today, and every point he made he follow with, ìAnd I think all Americans agree with that, and I think most Americans agree with that. And I think many Americans ó a great majority ó agree with me on this.î Itís part and parcel of what they do and what the media does, to try to make it look like all theyíre doing is reflecting and articulating positions that a majority of Americans have.And it isnít true! So when Trump points out how overwhelmingly popular Kavanaugh is at Trump rallies, it made means that the Drive-Bys are failing (thatís how they hear it, anyway) in their efforts to destroy Kavanaugh! Because in their minds, what ought to be happening is people should be telling Trump to drop Kavanaugh. If the media were succeeding here, people at these rallies would be urging Trump to drop Kavanaugh for the sake of the party and the sake of Trumpís presidency. Itís the exact opposite. So do not doubt me on this.Iím telling you, these people on in the media who have so much invested in their power, in their self-esteem related to their power that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say, it hurts íem to the quick. It disturbs them. Any time you can demonstrate to them that what theyíre trying to make you think isnít working, you will succeed in upsetting them ó and you might even get lucky enough to hear íem talk about it, as I just did on CNN.NBC News is desperately trying to convict Kavanaugh at the same time theyíve been trying to convict Trump colluding with Russia.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We had a drive-by caller here couldnít hang on with a question.  ìYou know, everybodyís looking for Kavanaughís friends to corroborate all these allegations.  Everybodyís trying to find Swetnickís friends that sheís name to validate all this and they canít find anybody.î  The four people that Dr. Ford mentioned are denying it, including one of her good friends, Bob Beckelís ex-wife. Keyser is her name.  At any rate, the Drive-By caller wanted to know where areÖ I donít know make it inspire something here, but where are all of the character witnesses for Dr. Ford?  Where are all of her buddies now saying, ìOh, yes, I know, this is entirely possible! She told me about it.î Where are all those people?  But you do know that her social media was scrubbed shortly before she arrived in Washington. Her social media, all of it was deleted somehow, scrubbed, erased, whatever was done with it.    "

I can blow up ó I can nuclearize ó everything they say that they think substantiates and backs up more investigations. How much more is necessary? Why didnít they they do this when Feinstein got the letter? Why hold it in reserve? She doesnít have anything to tell anybody unless she now commits perjury.She doesnít know where. She doesnít know when. The people she says were in the room all deny it. What is there to investigate it? What more is there to learn? ìKavanaughís a drunk.î Oh! Six FBI investigations havenít shown that? ìKavanaugh, heís not got the right judicial temperament. Look at the way he behaved at the committee.î What about the years heís served as a judge? Why donít you look at that, instead of a guy naturally, properly outraged at being destroyed by the Democrat Party!His attitude made perfect sense! More information is better than less? Nobody is talking about less information here. Nobody is trying to suppress information here. Nobodyís been trying to suppress anything. Kavanaugh has answered more questions, more written questions than all Supreme Court nominees combined! There is not a shortage of information! There has not been a short shrifting of any investigation. But thereís another thing, maybe not the thing, but this is another thing that really grates on me.Jeff Flake just said ó and heís not the only one. There are a lot of people saying this. (paraphrase) ìAfter Christine Blasey Fordís credibility testimony, Iím getting calls from women all over America whoíve been inspired to come forward because of her brave and courageous testimony.î Well, now, wait a minute. Didnít Anita Hill cause women to come forward in droves? And what about the #MeToo movement itself? Didnít Harvey Weinstein cause women to start calling in and coming through in droves saying, ìYes, itís happened to meî?And then every other person named. Matt Lauer, Les Moonves ó NBC, CBS ó all of these #MeToo guys that have been named and called out. Why didnít that inspire women all over America to call Congress and say, ìYeah, it happened to me, tooî? In other words, theyíre asking us to believe that women are out there suffering alone, suffering in private, suffering in anonymity, and it was Christine Blasey Ford and her testimony which is causing women to call Congress in droves.Well, what have women been doing all during the #MeToo movement? Donít misunderstand me. Iím saying that sheís a late arrival to this. The idea of men abusing women and the #MeToo movementÖ I mean truthful stories of it. Donít misunderstand me here. Sheís by no means the first. Women have been coming out of the woodwork claiming Hollywood this, Hollywood that abused me. This guy mistreated me, raped me, whatever. How about the University of Virginia Rolling Stone story?How about Lena Dunham talking about all the horrible things that have happened to her? Havenít all of these stories caused women to feel newly emancipated to come forward with their stories? And yet, on the tail end of the #MeToo movement ó after Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill and so forth ó Christine Blasey Ford goes and testifies and Flake says, ìIím hearing from so many women who are sayingÖî (interruption) Well, no, my point is that I think anybody can say that.But we donít know whoís calling these people, and we donít even know if the people calling him are not Democrat activists to begin with just to create the phone traffic. My contention to you is that the #MeToo movement alone has no doubt inspired a lot of women to courageously step up and accuse guys that have mistreated them. Itís not a new phenomenon. Itís not something for which she deserves all kinds of credit because this is at the tail end of this new awareness and sensitivity.And yet itís being spoken of ó Christine Blasey Fordís testimony and her inspiration is being spoken of ó as though itís a standalone and itís never happened before. And that adds to her credibility, donít you see? And I think weíre all being played. Oh, yeah. I do. (interruption) No. Iím not accusingÖ Iím not saying women arenít coming forward. Iím saying itís not a new thing that they are. Believe me. (chuckles) TalkÖ (chuckles) Go ask Harvey Weinstein, go ask Matt Lauer, and go talk to Les Moonves and ask them if they think this is something relatively new here that started happening because of Christine Ford.It isnít. Itís all part of the plan to make this particular incident revolutionary, new, and so important because this brave, courageous woman is causing other women to be brave in ways theyíve never felt like being before. And I think thatís not right. I think the sensitivity, the consciousness raising has been going on since Weinstein or even before that. But every time thereís a public incident like this involving male abuse or alleged male abuse, part and parcel of it is, ìIím hearing from women all over America who are so thankful to Dr. Ford because she has given me the courage.îWell, did the #MeToo movement not work on íem? Did the #MeToo movement not give them courage? I just think weíre being played here, folks. Of course, it gives Flake cover for what heís done. He can make himself out to be a hero. ìYeah, we need more information. We need more information. Yeah, whatís wrong with more information?î Whatís wrong with more information is not the question. Why do we need to give the Democrats more time to make up a bunch of other information, ought to be the suspicion here.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Well, Jeff Flake just lost it. Itís the Forbes something for under 30 summit meeting. Itís in Boston, and he just lost it. He said, ìIím a man without a country. I canít support Donald Trump. I canít vote for Donald Trump. Look what he said about John McCain. Look what he said about Mexicans. I canít support him,î and thatís what this is all about. Like I said in the first hour of this program, this reallyÖ When you strip this down to what itís really about, itís not about Kavanaugh.That makes this an even bigger shame because heís gonna be destroyed as the Democrats attempt to get rid of Trump. Thatís what this all is, and the reason they targeted Flake is ícause then that Flake hates Trump. Flake canít get reelected in Arizona because of Trump. Flake despises Trump; he has for I donít know how long. He is eager to screw Trump while making it look like that he is standings in solidarity with the abused women of America. But thatís not what this is about.From the Democrats to Flake to the media, this is about raw hatred of Donald Trump and making sure he is denied this court seat or any other court seat and making sure that Trump doesnít get anything substantively done. This is about getting rid of Donald Trump. This about making sure that Trump is paralyzed (and his administration) following the midterms in November. If anything ó if anything ó ought to be inspiring Republicans to vote, it is that.It is that the Democrats and the Republican-conservative Never Trumpers are trying to destroy the presidency that was duly elected by the people in 2016. Thatís what needs to be used to generate turnout for Republicans ó House candidates, Senate candidates, and all over the country ó in November, because thatís what this really is. And Kavanaugh is caught in this crossfire. Make no mistake. I mean, theyíre happy to take him out because of who he is and what he represents, but itís Trump theyíre aiming at.  "

An infobabe from the Drive-By Media persisted in trying to start questions about Kavanaugh, which has led to a discussion about it. Trump is now talking about the FBI investigation, and I have to tell youÖ You know, Iím jumping the gun a little bit on this comment, but from Friday afternoon, the minuteÖThe minute we learned that the FBI was gonna be called on to do another weekís worth of investigating, it was abundantly clear to me what all of this is. Itís simply about one word, folks. Itís about delay, delay and delay ó and with each new revelation, the need to continue to delay. Itís secondarily about Kavanaugh. (interruption) Yeah, oh, theyíre still targeting Kavanaugh for total nuclear destruction. Thatís part and parcel of this too. The way it works is very simple.You have Jeff Flake saying that he and [Sen. Chris] Coons have struck a deal that there will be a one-week FBI investigation of the claims made by Christine Blasey Ford. Never mind the fact that she doesnít have any evidence to back up her claim. Never mind that she is not credible! Itís another thing thatís grating on me, hearing everybody in the Drive-By Media talk about, ìSheís credible, a credible allegation! Itís a credibleÖî No, itís not credible.But sheís being automatically supported and described as credible, and of course Kavanaugh is not. Kavanaugh is not credible. She is suspect she has no evidence to back this up or corroboration at all. So the FBI says, ìOkay. Weíll do this for a week,î and immediately, before sundown on Friday, a bunch of Democrats say, ìPfft! A week isnít long enough! Itís silly to limit this.î Then Trump, right on cue, said (summarized), ìI havenít limited the FBI. NBC is lying about it.ìI havenít limited the FBI and their scope.î Meaning now Trumpís on record and everybody is that if this thing needs to go beyond a week, well, itís gonna go beyond a week ó and I guarantee you that is the objective here and thatís why new allegations about Kavanaugh being a wild, violent drunk? ìWe need to track that down!î Kavanaugh may be having committed perjury about his calendars and stuff.ìWell, we gotta track that down.î Kavanaugh may not have the temperament to be on the court, given how enraged and angry he was during his testimony at the Judiciary Committee. ìWeíve gotta track that down.î Itís delay, delay, delay, delay, delay, delay ó and itís gonna be tougher and tougher and tougher to hold to this Friday vote. The people on the Republican side are gonna have to get some steel for a backbone and shut this down at some point or itís just gonna continue to be delayed, delayed, and delayed.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Ladies and gentlemen, I became aware yesterday of a transcript of a conference call that occurred last week among and between Democrat activists who were planning exactly what happened on Friday. Itís laid out in this thing. Now, unfortunately I canít reproduce this and put it at RushLimbaugh.com, because I donít legally have it. But Iíve got it.Iím not gonna mention any names, but the names of the Democrat front groups and organizations are here and the strategies that they used. It makes it crystal clear that they were going to target Jeff Flake! He was seen as the most malleable and the easiest to intimidate! The elevator incident, where it just happened that two nearly insane anti-Kavanaugh, pro-Democrat activists ended up there in Flakeís elevator with a CNN camera right there to catch what happened? They started shouting, and they started accusing, and they started pointing finger.He got scared to death. It was all part of the strategy to turn him. There was a three-point strategy. The Flake strategy was No. 3 if the other two had bombed out, and they made it work. They pulled it off. They did it! John Fund has a piece today at National Review: ìWho Was Behind the Flake Setup? ó ACORNís tactics live on in the senatorís elevator confrontation with activists from a Soros-backed group.ìOn Friday morning, two women raced past reporters and security officers and blocked a senators-only elevator in the U.S. Capitol. They cornered Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who had just announced he was going to vote yesÖî This is in the morning. Itís before the hearing began. He was on his way to the hearing. ìThey cornered Arizona senator Jeff Flake, who had just announced he was going to vote yes on moving Brett Kavanaughís nomination out of the Judiciary Committee and onto the Senate floor for a full debate.îìThe women wouldnít let Flake leave until they had yelled at him, face to face, for several minutes.î You could see him wilting, shrinking, shaking. ìA CNN camera [happened to be there to] broadcast the event live, and from there it went viral.î Thereís no doubt that CNN was in on this ambush. The ambush was planned. Jeff Flake was targeted as one of the three points of the strategy that left-wing activist groupsÖ There might have been seven or eight of them on this conference call.ìAna Maria Archila and Maggie Gallagher were the two women who confronted Flake inside the elevatorÖ Perhaps because the women expressed such raw emotion, few media outlets dug into their political activism.î They didnít want to dig into their political activism! They just wanted to portray them as average, ordinary American women who just happened to get into the building. They didnít want anybody to know they were Democrat activists! They knew they were Democrat activists!CNN knew this!Look, everybodyís in on this! This whole thing is a gigantic setup! The Democrats donít care about another FBI investigation. Thatís just a trick for more delay! Kavanaughís already undergone six! You think six background checks on Kavanaugh missed the fact that he was such a drunk he beat people up, which is the latest allegation. Somebody who knew him at Yale ó the guyís now a professor at North Carolina ó has a piece in the Raleigh News & Observer that Kavanaugh got belligerently drunk, and heís seen it.Well, nobody has any information on Kavanaugh and his drinking in the last 20 years. All that happened was that Kavanaugh ended up No. 1 in his class in high school, in college, and in law school. Somebody so drunk, so sloppy, planning his next gang rape? I guarantee you that kind of person does not become No. 1 in anything decent. But Kavanaugh was. He was No. 1 in his class in high school and college and in law school.Kavanaugh has achievements that 90% of us would never even bother to dream about, they are so daunting. Most of us wonít even attempt them. They have to go back to high school, have to go back to college to find evidence of binge drinking? If you do that youíre gonna find binge drinking on the part of a lot of people. Youíre gonna find evidence like that today, because donít you knowÖ?Ladies and gentlemen donít you know the stress of life in America is so, so bad ó itís so horrible ó that thereís all kinds of self-medication going on. All kinds of people are drinking, and they make excuses for them because the pressure is so intense. But I donít find anybody testifying that Kavanaughís been a fall-down, beat-íem-up drunk the last 25 or 30 years, do you, or even beyond that? Next, they say, ìHe may have committed perjury.ìIf he lied about the people on that calendar, if he lied about what those terms mean, if heís committed perjury, he is gone. We need the FBI to look into that. We need the FBI to look into whether or not he beats people up on Yaleís campus, and we need to really track down this judicial temperament of his. Why, you see the way he acted on our committee hearing on Friday? He was yelling and screaming. Thatís not the kind of temperament we want from a judge!îWell, my buddy Andy McCarthy makes a great point. If you want a test, if you want to see Kavanaughís judicial temperament, thereís a place you can go. It is called the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals where Kavanaugh has been serving for years, and all you have to do is go there and study his work, and then to the courts prior to that where he was a judge. All of this is delay, delay, delay. They hope to find new women, drag new women out with new allegations.They hope to come up with new charges. The minute one weekís additional one-week FBI investigation was agreed to, the Democrats started saying, ìOne week isnít gonna be enough. We ó we canít stop!î Well, a weekend was enough for thousands and hundreds of thousands of Hillary Clinton emails. James Comeyís even gotten in on this! James Comey is now making no doubt about his partisanship in this and his Never Trumper, anti-Trump status, which is what all of this really is.If you boil all this down, what this is, folks, is hatred for Donald Trump by the Washington establishment, by the American left, and by the media. Itís unadulterated, undiluted, raw, poisonous hatred. Brett Kavanaugh is going to be destroyed in the process of damaging and getting rid of Donald Trump! They want to delay this beyond the midterms ícause they are convinced theyíre gonna win the Senate, the House and Senate. They can impeach Trump, and they can paralyze the rest of his administration.If Kavanaugh would happen to get on the court, theyíre gonna impeach him too. Jerrold Nadler who runs on the Judiciary Committee for the Democrats in the House says it. Heís not even the chairman, heís the ranking member, and heís already promising to impeach Kavanaugh for perjury and whatever else that has occurred so far, if the Democrats win the House. They canít stand it! They cannot stand that Donald Trump is president!They cannot stand that Donald Trump is putting a tremendous, absolutely great human being and conservative on the Supreme Court! Itís driving them hysterically crazy! So all of this ó all these new charges, all these new suggestions for investigation, all these calls for more time ó all it is is delay. The next time you hear, ìKavanaugh reportedly very frequently in college got drunk and hit people in the face!î substitute one word for that: Delay.This is all about continuing to delay it, which is why it is as it has always been: At some point the Republicans are gonna have to shut this down and call for a vote! Now, is anybody else like me, concerned? The FBI leadership ó many of them are gone, but a lot are still there ó has done its level best to screw Donald Trump, working with the intelligence agencies. We had that cabal conducting a silent coup to get rid of Trump during the campaign and then destroy his transition.They have been trying to destroy his presidency with this phony Russia collusion, the Mueller investigation and all that. Now that same agency ó with James Comey with an email now encouraging them to dig deep. ìKeep digging! Keep digging,î Comey says. (paraphrased) ìThereís gotta be something there.î The same guy that exonerated Hillary Clinton without even an interview, the same guy that said they found new questionable emails on the laptop of Carlos Danger, and in a matter of three days reviewed a hundred thousand of them to find there was nothing there.So they can do whatever theyíre gonna do in a day or two if they want to. But then, what happens if the FBI looks into all of this and reportsÖ By the way, they reached no conclusions, and if they do (chuckles), then weíll know a lot. But if, in the 302s ó the forms and the results of interviews ó they produce no evidence for Christine Blasey Ford, if they produce no evidence for any other allegation, if they cannot produce anything that says Kavanaugh did it, whatever ìitî isÖIn other words, if this investigation clears Kavanaugh like every FBI investigation heretofore has, do you think the Democrats are gonn asay, ìOh, okay, good! We got our week; now we can vote!î You think thatís gonna be the case? Hell, no! Theyíre gonna say, ìThe investigation is not thorough. The investigation was stilted by Trump. The investigation was cheating. The investigation was not long enough!î Whatever! Theyíre not gonna accept anything here! At some point, theyíre gonna have to be treated as the minority they are and all this just shut down and vote!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: There is some interesting polling data on Kavanaugh from Mark Penn, who runs the polling unit at Harvard University. Thereís also Jeff Flake. Mollie Hemingway at The Federalist says that Flake said that he is a ìyesî vote on Kavanaugh pending FBI review to allay othersí concern. So unless Kavanaughís revealed to be some serial rapist who hid successfully in six previous background checks, Flake is a ìyes.î Can we trust Flake? He said he was a ìyesî last Friday, too, and look where we are!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, folks, I was just taking a look here at the Fox Business Channel, and they just ran a chyron, a little graphic at the bottom of the screen. It was on the Fox Business Channel, not the Fox News Channel, although Iím sure it will show up at some point. The chyron says this: ìSource to Fox: Kavanaugh FBI Probe Could Be Wrapped up by Tuesday.î Thatís tomorrow. So Fox News is saying that the Kavanaugh FBI probe is gonna be wrapped up by.If it is? (sigh) You can expect the Democrats to go ballistic! Theyíre expecting at least a week! Thatís what Flake was assured. I donít know howÖ Fox is running it as a source theyíve got. Thereís nothing to find. The FBI has looked at Kavanaugh! This will be the seventh time, folks! Christine Blasey Ford does not have any evidence for them to track down! She canít even tell them where to look!She canít tell them when to look unless she starts suddenly remembering it now, and I guess they would say that thatís credible. The trauma has awakened repressed memories! I put nothing past them. But she canít remember when, not even the year. Sheís not even sure of the house and where it is ó and, by the way, how are you able to draw a floor plan of a house and not know where it was?She canít tell anybody how she got home. She canít tell anybody what she told anybody after the supposedly horrible event happened to her. Whatever else she is, she is not credible. The FBI has looked into this guy. This is the seventh time. If he were a binge drinker as an adult and beating people up and sending them to jail, that would be found long before now. So remember, none of this is about what itís about. This is about delay, delay, delay, delay. Thatís all the Democrats want here.So whenever the FBI produces its results and whatever the results are, the Democrats have an answer for it. If they exonerate Kavanaugh, the investigation was not thorough. Trump told the FBI to overlook a bunch of people. They can accuse Trump, us, Kavanaugh of anything and be confident the media will carry the water of that allegation. If the FBI finds corroborating evidence, well, people are gonna have to ask, ìHow come you missed it six previous times over who knows how many years youíve been looking into this guy?ìHow could you find any evidence when she didnít tell you where to go look?î Oh. ìWell, and did you talk to Michael Avenatti? If the FBI didnít talk to his client and didnít talkÖ?î Iím telling you, no matter how thisÖ If the FBI exonerates Kavanaugh, whenever they do it, do you really think the Democrats gonna are say, ìFine, we got what we wanted. Now weíre prepared to go vote.î Do you think thatís gonna be the result? It will not be.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/28/hillary-hack-tweets-threat-kavanaugh-wont-serve-for-life/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 28, 2018RUSH: As to the political nature of this, we mentioned the name Brian Fallon to you a couple of times in the past two days. Brian Fallon was a spokesman for Hillary Clintonís presidential campaign, her failed presidential campaign. Brian Fallon is an angry, vindictive, bitter, and very sore loser. He posted what many people say look like veiled threats to Kavanaugh last night. He called Kavanaugh an ìattempted rapistî and vowed that Judge Kavanaugh, if confirmed, ìwill not serve for life.îCurrently, Brian Fallon is the executive director of something called We Demand Justice. It is a front group for another liberal big-money group called the Democracy Alliance. He tweeted, ìIf Senate GOP ignores Dr. Blasey Ford and tries to muscle an attempted rapist onto the Supreme Court: 1. They will pay dearly this November. 2. Senators up in 2020 (Collins, Gardner et al) will feel intense heat for next two years. 3. Kavanaugh will not serve for life.î That is a veiled threat. He didnít add any clarification. He ìwill not serve for life.îWhatís a reasonable personís initial reaction to that?Iíll bet you the initial reaction is not, ìYeah, weíre gonna impeach him. If we win the House and we win the Senate, weíre gonna impeach him. Weíre gonna throw him off the court.î Thatís not what peopleís initial reaction is. When the social media universe sits there and sees, ìKavanaugh will not serve for life,î they think of something a little bit more dastardly. But this is not partisan, says Cory Booker. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Itís not partisan. This is about the heroism of Dr. Ford. Cory Booker is still talking. Heís gone way beyond his limit. So I gotta find out whatís shaking here.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/28/kavanaugh-beat-back-the-smear/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 28, 2018RUSH: Yeah, so everybody went to bed last night and got up today thinking that the Senate committee was gonna vote at 9:30, vote the nomination out to the full Senate. Then we heard that Senator Flake decided to vote for Kavanaugh. That made it a done deal, 11-10, and then we find out the voteís not gonna be ítil 1:30, and itís clear that everybody wanted the biggest audience possible for it; so they waited to do it during my show.JOHNNY DONOVAN: And now, from sunny south Florida, itís Open Line Friday!RUSH. And we are more than happy to accommodate them here, folks. If they want to conduct the the vote after four hours of speechifying Democrats, ìWah! Wah! Wah! We still want to complain about FBI more! Wah! Wah! Wah! Kavanaugh is a sloppy, fall-down drunk and I want to show pictures of his calendar, and I want toÖ Wah! Wah!î So Grassley said, ìWell, okay.î So the voteís gonna be at 1:30, after a bunch of speechifying here. Greetings and welcome. Rush Limbaugh at 800-282-2882 if you want to be on the program.The email address, ElRushbo@eibnet.us. And it is Open Line Friday; so if youíre tired of all of this and want to talk about something else, you can. Thatís what Open Line Fridayís about. (interruption) Snerdley is shaking his head in there. Are you protesting to haveÖ? (interruption) YouÖ? (interruption) Let me tell you something. (interruption) Let me tell you something. Thereís a lot of stories out there that have nothing to do with this.Do you know that the iPhone is now a misogynist device? The iPhone, the iPhone XS Max is said to be anti-woman because itís too big. Iím not making this up. There are feminist groups disguised as Apple customers complaining that the big iPhoneÖ Even though thereís all kinds of different sizes, the big iPhone is too big. Itís discriminatory because it doesnít fit womenís hands. (interruption) Yeah, of course you can find it in your purse easier and you can see it better.(interruption) Iíve never heard of women complaining about something that they hold in their hand being too big, but theyíre doing it about this. Thatís my whole point. That news is out there. Iíve been holding that news. Anyway, Iím just saying if all of this has you frustrated and bored and you want to bring something else up, you can. Thatís what Open Line Friday is all about. I donít expect much of that. But if you want to, you can.In getting started, I want to go back to the very end of the program yesterday and I want to replay something I said. Rather than just tell you I said it, I want to go back to the program archives from yesterday and I want to play it. I got an email note from a journalist friend of mine. Actually, more than one. But at the time, I got this one. It frosted me. The email, very quickly, said, ìWell, tell me what you think privately?ìI think heís toast. I thinkÖ I think heís toast. I just do.î Internally, I just exploded. That kind of fatalism and defeatism is what I hate about politics. Kavanaugh had not testified yet. All we had had was Blasey Ford and her testimony and the Democratsí reaction to it, and there are already people willing to give up. ìI think heís toast,î and Iíd heard it throughout the day. Even before Blasey Fordís testimony, I heard, ìKavanaughís toast,î and it just made me livid.Really. I canítÖ IÖ Itís not that I canít relate to it. Everybody can relate to fatalism, defeatism and that kind of thing if you get depressed about certain circumstances and how theyíre unfolding. But this, to me, was no time to give up, and itís certainly no time to lose faith in Kavanaugh. So this is pretty much how the program ended; therefore, many of you may not have heard it. So I want to replay it.BEGIN ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: I just got an email from a guy, a journalist friend. He said, ìI think Kavanaughís toast, donít you?î I wrote back, ìNo, I do not think Kavanaughís toast. We didnít learn anything new! We still donít know what, when, where, why.î The people involved that she named all deny it in a sworn affidavit!Brett Kavanaugh can deny all this with far more certitude than she can assert it! You know, not knowing where or when supposedly makes it tough for Kavanaugh to deny it because how do you say you were never at a place that she isnít even able to name? You watch. If this were me under all these allegations, Iíd be livid at this. Iíd be livid that anybody believed it, given this many holes and given this lack of corroboration, this lack of evidence.ìI donít know where it happened. I donít know how I got home. I donít know when it was. I donít know what I told people afterwards. Iíve got a bunch of Democrat lawyers offering their services to me for free.î Weíve got the Democrat Party running this operation! Itís a shame that the Republican prosecutor didnít pull that off. Thatís what she was trying to do. It didnít work. So now itís up to Kavanaugh, and itís up to what two or three Republican senators think.I definitely believe he can beat this back. I donít have any doubt that he can. Whether he will, you know, thatís a pressure-packed moment. But I think he can. Against this? Some say, ìWell, Rush, itíd be a lot easier if she had named a place ícause he could proveÖî He could already prove he wasnít in the general neighborhood with his calendars! ìWell, that doesnít prove it, Rush.î She doesnít have any either is the whole point.Do you think Kavanaugh should cry? Noooo. Some people do. Ladies and gentlemen, despite ó despite all ó he can beat this back. I firmly believe that. I donít think anythingís over yet. Iím a one of those people, I used to fall prey to my initial reactions of what I thought and felt after seeing something on TV. But Iím older and wiser and far more suspicious, and I live in a current set of beliefs that the American people are wiser than normal over what they see on television. I could be dead wrong about that. But Iíve got faith.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: That is whyÖ If I may say so, that is why people listen to this program, ícause when this program was over yesterday there are a lot of people who thought Kavanaugh was toast. Those intelligent, learned, experienced in following these kind of things thought he was toast. Everywhere in the Drive-By Media, they were pre-celebrating ó Kavanaugh is toast ó and I didnít see it at all. I didnít, and I knew that Kavanaugh could come back from this. So I simply said so. And what did we get when Kavanaugh sat down?KAVANAUGH: This has destroyed my family and my good name ó a good name built up through decades of very hard work and public service at the highest levels of the American government. This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear thatís been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups. This is a circus! The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades.RUSH: He unloaded on them! I donít know what people thought, that he wasnít gonna be able to or was not going to think it was the right thing to do, but he unloaded on them, and he happened to nail it right there. He told the world exactly what he was up against and what was going on. You know, the Senate Republicans decided not to vote on Obamaís nominee, Merrick Garland. They just didnít vote on him for a year using the Biden Rule that we donít vote on nominees made by lame-duck presidents in the last year of their presidency.We didnít try to destroy Merrick Garland. There was not an effort to ruin his life, his family, his reputation, his career, or his record. They just didnít vote on the guy! Contrast that to way the Democrat Party has treated Brett Kavanaugh. They decided to ruin a manís life. Theyíre still trying to do it today. Theyíre gonna keep trying until the full Senate vote is over, and theyíre not gonna stop then. The stakes are simply too high for them. So I knew that Kavanaugh could come out roaring and this wasnít over. Hereís one more example of Kavanaugh from yesterday.KAVANAUGH: Iím not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person, in some place, at some time. But I have never done this to her or to anyone. Thatís not who I am and itís not who I was. I am innocent of this charge. I intend no ill will to Dr. Ford and her family. The other night Ashley and my daughter Liza said their prayers and little Liza ó all of 10 years old (voice breaking) ó said to Ashley, ìWe should pray for the woman.î Thatís a lot of wisdom from a 10-year-old.RUSH: Totally strange words for many Democrats on the committee. ìPray? Pray? WhatísÖ? Oh, you mean a Christian thing? Thatís another reason we hate the guy!î But thatís who he is and thatís what he said. Go back to the opening words of my comments replayed from yesterday. We still, at the end of the day yesterdayÖ By the way, one of the things that I think was determinant in shifting some votes: Rachel Mitchell, who was the female prosecutor from Arizona hired by the Republicans met with the Republicans.They caucused ó the Senate caucus last night, the Republican caucus ó and she told them as a sex-crime prosecutor she didnít hear a single thing that could even lead to a search warrant. Thatís where Lindsey Graham got the line. Itís a great line. Thereís not even enough to get a search warrant. Thereís not enough to do any kind of examination. She doesnít remember where or when specifically. How is Kavanaugh ó howís anybody ó supposed to prove something where you canít even be told where he supposedly was, when he supposedly was?And yet that was the test. I have had so many people ask me in emails since last night and in the run-up to todayís show, ìRush, what is all of this with the Democrats and the FBI?î Look, if youíre frustrated by that, I join you, and I welcome you to the club. The simple fact of the matter is, Dianne Feinstein had this letter from Blasey Ford. Itís either July 9th or July 30th, but sometime in July she the bottom that letter. They sat on that later. Iím not even gonna talk about who leaked it. Weíll get to that in a minute.She sat on that letter. She interviewed Kavanaugh personally in her office after having received that letter and never asked her anything about it. She told all of her buddies on the committee about the letter but she did not do anything with it. They didnít call the FBI. They didnít use Senate investigators. They didnít pursue anything in Blasey Fordís letter. Do you wonder why? Iíll tell you why. Because to them, it was too sketchy. To them, it didnít have enough substance.It was not enough, by itself, to put in the mix of things they were going to use to try to destroy Kavanaugh in Phase 1 of the destruction. They set it aside. It became the Hail Mary tactic. They kept it in reserve in case everything else failed. They throw it out there, they engineer it being leakedÖ By the way, theyíre talking about the leak as some sinister violation of secrecy and protocol. No, no, no, no! They wanted it leaked! Whoever wanted it leaked!Thereís only certain people that saw this thing. DiFi and her staff, Anna Eshoo (Blasey Fordís congresswoman), and her lawyers. Her lawyers are denying that it leaked. The Intercept, which is the website that first got it, says they did not get it from DiFi or her staff. Somebody wanted it leaked. Somebody wanted it out there. The Democrats didnít want to put their name to it because they were gonna violate her privacy and secrecy, which she didnít want.This was used in ways that supposedly Christine Blasey Ford did not want it used. They could have called the FBI in July. They could have called Blasey Ford. They could have called Kavanaugh in. They could have called all these witnesses ó Mark Judge and everybody else. They could have called in Kaiser, who was the best friend of Blasey Ford. They could have done anything they wanted. They had the letter, and they could have gone the committee to investigate. They didnít.So now on the last day where Kavanaugh and Ford are testifying, they throw out this FBI thing as though they have been denied a legitimate investigation because Kavanaugh wonít okay it, because Grassley wonít okay it. Despite Grassley and every Republican refuting this whole FBI thing, they keep pounding on it because their audience is Democrat voters who theyíre trying to rile up for the midterms. This is a voter get-out-the-vote procedure, and thereís an ancillary hope that it might still derail a vote. Thereís Dick Durbin sitting there talking to Kavanaugh, ìWill you pointÖ? Just take a look at Don McGahn, Trumpís lawyer in there.ìYou tell him you want an FBI investigation.î This was aÖ It was nothing. Folks, itís a delay tactic is all it is. The Republicans have correctly identified and called all of these Democrats out on it. They know theyíre not gonna get an FBI investigation. In fact, if Kavanaugh had said, ìOkay, fine! Letís get the FBI in here,î they would have been caught short. They donít expect this. Itís a pipe dream. They know theyíve had the chance to do this and get it. They didnít believe this woman when they got the letter.Nobody else is saying this. I donít think anybody has got the courage to say it because there is a narrative around Dr. Ford, and that narrative is she is unchallengeable. She must be believed. Well, they didnít believe her when they got the letter. Theyíve now thrown and rolled the dice on Christine Ford being the weapon to get rid of Kavanaugh. If that was the case, they would have fired this weapon during regular confirmation hearings and interviews of Kavanaugh.They would have made him explain all this back then if they really thought this was sufficient to disrupt and delay and stall or maybe end his nomination. But they didnít have that much faith. Because, look, anybody with half a brain ó and some of these people still have half a brain ó could look at this letter and say, ìShe doesnít know where it happened. She doesnít know when it happened. She cannot answer enough questions that would literally inspire a legitimate investigation, either by local police or the FBI or anybody else that wanted to look into it.îThereís nowhere to go with this investigation. She canít tell íem where it happened! So how the hell do you investigate this? All the people she claims were there are denying it. Yet they keep pounding this FBI thing and how theyíve been wronged and theyíve been treated cheated, the Democrats. Theyíve been short changed. Itís nothing more than an attempt to the delay and make the American people think the Republicans are cheating. Amy Klobuchar, by the way, in her little speech before the vote was takenÖ This is a half hour ago.Amy Klobuchar, who was part of the effort yesterday to portray Kavanaugh as a falling-down drunk that canít remember where he is every day when he gets up because he got drunk the night before. She let the cat out of the bag as to one of the things this is really all about. She essentially said that Kavanaughís not legit because of who nominated him: Trump. Trump, a misogynist! Trump, a woman hater! Trump, a woman abuser! Trump this and that. Trump, who believes in expanding federal power out the wazoo, and he says so does Kavanaugh. She said that Kavanaughís illegitimate, not qualified simply because of who picked him.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I thought it was brilliant of Kavanaugh to call íem out, to say this was all an operation of political hacks. Iíll never forget Durbin and Cory Booker. ìAre you sayingÖ? Are you actually saying that Christine Ford is a Democrat operative and a Democrat hack and this is all part of aÖ?î ìI wish her no ill will, Senator. But you, on the other hand, Senator?î He didnít say this, but this was the unspoken (yet conveyed) message. ìYou are running this operation, and you are running her. She didnít want any of this, and you brought her forward.îFor somebody who didnít want all of this, she sure seemed eager to do it at the end of the day, right? Do we even believe she didnít want to do it? Look at what theyíre asking us to believe here! But there is no question that this whole thing was a politically hatched idea. Everything from theÖ In fact, Iím not even sure that letter came in over the transom! Iím not sure that letter from her arrived without anybodyís foreknowledge that it was coming. Nothing they do like this is unscripted! I know these people!  "

It doesnít pass any kind of test ó and this affidavit as well.It had to be happening at parentsí houses. Either the parents were there and were in on it or were not there or nobody told them about it or they did tell them and they didnít care. Those are all valid questions too. Ten of them! ìThe latest accuser says that these gang rape parties were commonplace and that Kavanaugh and his friends with regularly drug women and violently assault them.î But she doesnít specifically say Kavanaugh did that. Just that he was there. She alone went to 10 of these parties in one year.Why would you keep going to these things, particularly if youíre not one of the drugged and liquored-up women? If youíre there and you know whatís happening upstairs ó if you know that a bunch of women have been drugged and prepared for gang rape upstairs, and youíre downstairs ó you just go to the party and you party and you hang out and you donít care any of this is going on upstairs or downstairs, wherever it was. But the fact that there are no names, the fact that there are no specifics tells me they donít want this corroborated.They donít want investigators to be able to find anything. They want to leave it at the seriousness of the charge, and they want to avoid the nature of the evidence. This is the same strategy (with slight alterations) that they used in suckering in poor old George Papadopoulos. They would tell Papadopoulos ó FBI spies would tell Papadopoulos ó that the Russians had Hillary Clinton emails. Well, Papadopoulos is a young guy on the periphery of the Trump campaigns, thinks heís an insider now. Man, they like him! They trust him. Theyíre telling him this inside dope.So he starts telling other people, ícause he wants to be seen as an insider! So he starts telliní people. So he goes to a bar with the ambassador from Australia. ìHey, you know, the Russians? We findÖ Iím in the Trump campaign. We know the Russians have a bunch of Hillaryís emails.î Well, he only knows that ícause the FBI told him. The Australian ambassador calls the FBI.(laughing) ìHey, I got a guy here! Heís in the Trump campaign, and he says he knows that the Russians have Hillaryís emails.î The FBI says, ìWhat? Well, we better go get a FISA warrant.î They plant it! They make sure it circulates! It comes back to them. Then they go to the judge and then the media gets wind of it and starts running it, and they get a warrant spy. Thatís what this is. Somebody 12 years, 35 years after the fact says, ìYeah, you know what happened?î ìYeah, I know! Iíll sign a corroborating statement that she told me that it happened.îSo you get a bunch of people saying, ìYeah, I heard about it.îìWere you there?îìNo, no. I wasnít there.îìDo you know where it happened?îìNo, Iím just telling you she told me. She told me and I can corroborate that she told me.îìOh, you canít corroborate what she told you. I mean, you donít know that it actually happened. Youíre just corroborating that she told you that it did.îìYeah, yeah. I can corroborate that.îSo, folks, Snerdley can in here to me today and say that he overheard while he was in Washington two weeks ago Barack Obama admit that he ordered the FBI to spy on Trump. And when he told me that, I could corroborate it. I could corroborate it. I could come to you and say, ìSnerdley told me that Obama ordered the FBI to spy on Trump. Iím a corroborating witness, not to the fact that Obama did that but to the fact that Snerdley told me.î This is the scam that theyíre running, among many other things.†Hereís another thing. Itís startingÖ The trickle is starting from conservative media. ìKavanaugh has got it pull out. Kavanaugh has got to withdraw. He cannot continue with this deluge. He just cannot continue. He cannot, because he will not be able to ever get out from underneath this cloud no matter what. We do not,î say our conservative brethren in the Never Trump community. ìWe do not want a great justice on the court forever clouded by these allegations where weíre gonna be always questioning every decision that he writes,î and thatís why we lose.We got people that want to cave, and thatís not how you deal with this stuff. Decent people are forever going to be treated indecently if they stand aside and allow it. I donít know where Kavanaughís head is. My guess is that Kavanaugh no more wants to walk away from this than Clarence Thomas wanted to walk away from Anita Hill. Kavanaugh has put everything heís got into this, his latest statement. Oh, this is another thing. There are people running around, I saw it on TV earlier today, ìYou know, I donít know about Kavanaugh. Heís starting to equivocate.îWell, that perked my ears up. When did Kavanaugh ìequivocateî? This person on TV said, ìYeah, he said, ëWell, you know, Iím not perfect.'î He didnít say that today! I was looking for that.î He said that on Fox News earlier this week in the midst of an interview! It wasnít about this! It wasnít in response to this specific allegation. Yet there are people running around today saying, ìAh, this is not a very strong response to say, ëIím not perfect.í Thatís not how youÖî He didnít say it! He called it the Twilight Zone.He said he doesnít know this woman. This is absurd. Itís ridiculous. None of this ever happened. They canít prove it. All they can do is find Democrat activists to conjure up stories and go to willing accomplices in theÖ Oh! Another thing. Remember the call we had yesterday from somebody who went to Yale with Kavanaugh. She was calling from Wyoming. She was in a residential college with Kavanaugh. She told us on this program yesterday that reporters from the Huffing and Puffington Post and other Drive-By outlets were hounding her throughout the summer for data, for information, tell-all on Kavanaugh.From the summer!From THE SUMMER!The media has been chasing down, tracking down anybody and everybody that might have gone to school with Kavanaugh! Theyíre calling them up and theyíre interviewing them, in some cases browbeating them, and this caller yesterday said (summarized), ìTheyíre clearly looking for certain angles, and I didnít provide it to them, and they got irritated and pending ending the conversation.î Do you remember the callerís first name? Doesnít matter. But I asked her to hold over through the break, and we talked to her.Thereís a story here today that this has been going on throughout the media throughout the summer. This is so obviously gotcha. This is a coordinated plan. Itís been planted and coordinated for months, and now we are in the execution phase of it, and itís being made to look like all of these women coming forward are random. But Avenatti produced this woman today because Blasey Ford is bombing out and Ramirez isnít gonna go anywhere because Ramirez doesnít even want to testify. Thatís the second woman.She doesnít even want to testify before the committee. Blasey Ford I donít think ever was, and I still donít. They wanted to force Kavanaugh out simply with the allegations. They wanted Kavanaugh to conclude it be impossible to go on. They wanted Trump to conclude itíd be impossible to go on. Thatís what they were trying to do. Kavanaugh refused to go away. So here comes Julie Swetnick after Avenatti telegraphs that itís coming earlier this week, a couple days ago, Monday.Weíre being led to believe is that Swetnick is so frustrated! (sobbing) ìShe didnít want to come forward, butÖ butÖ but the fact that Blasey Ford is being mistreated and Ramirez is being mistreated and women are being mistreated and women are not being believed and Iíve got no choice to come forward and talk about the rape-train stories!î This has the potential of backfire ó and I said that earlier this week ó at the Democrat Party like you cannot believe. Okay. Let me take a brief time-out. I promise when we come backÖ I know youíre itching out there. I know youíre dying to get on the air.I know you want to tell everybody what you think about this so we will startÖ Oh. One more thing before the break. SeeÖ (Snort!) I go through the Stack, Iím ready to go to a break, and I turn what I just used and put it at the bottom of the Stack and I see whatís next up and say, ìOh, yeah! I remember that.î Headline: ìSurprise: Democratic Operative Admits Derailing Kavanaugh is Really About ëSavingí the Supreme Court from Trump.î Guy Benson as Townhall has the story.Itís about Brian Fallon, former top spokesman for Hillary. This is not news. Anybody thatís paying attention to this for years knows that this is a scam that the Democrats are running, and itís one that they have run many times before. Nothing new in this, other than the depth to which they are sinking. But itís a strategy, and Brian Fallon has admitted it in an interview with the New York Times. He ìunambiguously admits what the Brett Kavanaugh destruction project is [is] part of a high-stakes, two-step strategy to thwart Trump ó via a former aide to Mitch McConnell.î A former aide to McConnell is confirming this.Thatís all this is.Stop Trump.Stop Trump.Stop Kavanaugh.Stop conservatives.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Hereís another thing. Remember we had the call by Jenny from Wyoming yesterday? She told us that she was getting called from media people throughout the summer because it had been learned that she attended a residential college at Yale at the same time Kavanaugh was there. She was at the same residential college. So she and other people had been tracked down by the media, and all summer long the Drive-Bys were calling anybody and everybody that they thought might have known Kavanaugh to try to dig up some dirt on the guy.ëCause the Drive-Bys have been working with the Democrats to destroy every Republican nominee in your lifetime and mine. How come it isÖ? With the Drive-Bys scouring the earth, scorched-earth policy just in the past three or four months talking to all of these people that went to school with Kavanaugh, why did this never come up? If thereís anything to this one, why wasnít this first? Why was Christine Blasey Ford first? Because all of these three are part of a structured Democrat plan.We have that from none other than Brian Fallon, ìformer top spokesman for Hillary Clintonís failed presidential campaign, a confidante to Sen. Chuck Schumer, and an-ex senior official in Eric Holderís Justice Department. Heís also now the public face of a left-wing group devoted to defeating President Trumpís judicial nominees, with the most urgent priority being doing whatever is necessary to prevent Republicans from filling the current Supreme Court vacancy.ìIn an interview with the New York Times, Fallon unambiguously admits what the Brett Kavanaugh destruction project is part of a high-stakes, two-step strategy to thwart Trump ó via a former aide to Mitch McConnellÖî Headline: ìDemocratic Operative Admits Derailing Kavanaugh is Really About ëSavingí the Supreme Court from Trump.î Itís making sure that Trump doesnít get to confirm any of his nominees to the Supreme Court.Hereís a pull quote from the story: ìIt is downright frightening that multiple United States senators, whoíve supposedly been specifically chosen to sit on this influential committee due to their legal acumen, are saying that a man accused of sexual misconduct more than [35 years] ago Ö is responsible for disprovingî it! How can this happen? ìIt is downright frightening that multiple United States senators,î not just Democrats, Republicans too, who are on this ìcommittee due to their legal acumen,î can sit there and claim that an out-of-the-blue allegation 35 years later has to be disproven by the accused!ìThese senators would never, ever accept any such thing for themselves, for anyone they love, or for a political ally. But so long as this (frankly un-American) demand, that flies in the face of centuries of Western jurisprudence and the bedrock presumption of innocence, is useful to achieve the ëDemocratic dreamí articulated so candidly by [Brian] Fallon, theyíre going with it. Itís disgraceful. It really does seem like some of these bad actors do not care one whit about even feigning interest in discerning the truth. Itís all just a means to a desired partisan end, wherein principles and individuals can be embraced and discarded as necessary.îThatís the part of this that Iím having a tough time with. The open, wanton, entire destruction of a great and patriotic American life seems to bother none of these people. I donít even hear too many Republicans talking about this from that angle. ìItís a political fight. We want to get Trumpís nominee confirmed, or maybe we donít, but we want to get a Republican on the court, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.î But nobodyís talking about whatís happening here. Christine Fordís life is not being destroyed.Sheís gonna be a star and a heroine for the Democrat Party for the rest of her life like Anita Hill is. Brett Kavanaugh hasnít done anything to anybody, and the wanton, open ruination of his life and his family and his career doesnít seem to faze anybody involved in this. Itís just mind-boggling. This is a man of superior intellect and achievement. Within the confines of what this is about ó having somebody really good and qualified on the Supreme Court ó that seems to be the last thing in the list of considerations here.ìSo with a number of Republican and Democratic Senators still undecided on the nomination, and with highly-anticipated testimony slated for tomorrow, Mitch McConnell should make sure that every one of his members read theî New York Times piece where Brian Fallon of the Clinton campaign admits that this is a structured, strategic campaign to keep every Trump nominee off the Supreme Court. Every damn one of these Republicans ought to read it. They ought to not have to read this to know that!They ought not have to read this to know what the Democrat Partyís all about! Guy Benson says here, McConnell ìshould also make sure theyíre all aware of the cynically-shifting standards being adopted by the Left, in a transparent effort to turn any good faith move Republicans make into a lose/lose proposition.î So much of this stuff is basic. The Republicans ought not have to read a newspaper story where a Clintonista admits what the Democrats are doing in order to understand what the Democrats are doing.Again in this New York Times story, Brian Fallon, the Clintonista, admits ó without any doubt with great happiness and confidence ó that the Kavanaugh destruction project is part and parcel of keeping any Trump nominee off the Supreme Court. Anyway, thatís where we are now, with Grassley suggesting that the Senate could be open to a second hearing after the Swetnick allegations have been made. Thatís playing right into the Democrats hands. Another hearing is another delay. At the bare minimum, thatís what this is. At the bare minimum, itís a delay. At the abject worst, itís about the political murder of Brett Kavanaugh.  "

Quote, ìThis is ridiculous and from The Twilight Zone. I donít know who this is,î Julie Swetnick. ìI donít know who this is and this never happened.î Itís ìridiculous.î Itís ìfrom the Twilight Zone.î Now, I mentioned moments ago that I may be on the verge of revising my prediction. The prediction ó and it was very precise ó was if the Republicans donít confirm Kavanaugh, that thereís gonna be hell to pay and they could end up losing the Senate and the House.Because Republican voters would simply say, ìWhatís the point?î But now I may have to revise this because this latest pop-up, Julie Swetnick, put in combination with Blasey Ford and Ramirez and the way the Democrats are actingÖ Iím beginning to think now that this is going to create one of the biggest backlashes against Washington, and specifically the Democrats, if Kavanaughís not confirmed. My first prediction was predicated on the Republicans caving and refusing to defend and fight for Kavanaugh.My first prediction was based on that, and if that were the perception, if Republican voters think that if Republicans didnít try and caved to Democrats ó or the media, even worse ó then they would have trouble in the midterms. But this changes that, or has the potential to change this because now this takes it out of the hands of the Republicans. This is justÖ This is a tsunami, and it is out of the Twilight Zone. Most Republicans are gonna sit out there and say, ìWellÖ (Snort!)î They themselves are not gonna have suggested strategeries to push this back on this.The anger at this, I think, is going to dwarf whatever anger might have happened. Iím talking about if this latest woman hadnít shown up and if the Republicans caved and didnít really try to push back. But this now, it could change that thinking. Youíre frowning at me when you look at this. (interruption) Are you disagreeing with myÖ? (interruption) Well, it will screw these people up. Theyíve been playing this sound bite of me for the past three days.Now theyíll have to revise it. ìRush Limbaugh has changed!î Well, weíve got a new player in this. This bottom-of-the-gutter scum! We donít have any direct testimony about Kavanaugh doing anything in approximately 1982? Approximately? Ballsy Ford canít even place the year and now Swetnick canít define specifically the year, and just says that she was told that Kavanaugh was hang around whether these ìrape trains.î But in six FBI exams and everything leading up to this no evidence of ìrape trainsî was produced by anybody ever.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. So weíve got these women in the room here that have been drugged and boozed up and thereís a line of guys waiting for their turn up. Weíre talking about gang rape with a bunch of guys waiting in line. Does that make any sense? Does any of this make any sense? None of it does. Did anybody call the cops at all of these?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, ladies and gentlemen, on the bright side ó and there is a bright side to this. We may have reached a tipping point. I have thought this on several occasions over the years, but this may be a tipping point. This may be one of those incidents where the vast majority of the American population ó and I still believe that a majority of Americans are what I would classifying as decent people. I donít believe the majority of our country is plagued by massive psychological disorders that have led to a deranged political activism. I donít think thatís the majority of our country. I think itís silent. It shows up and elects Trump now and then. You know, things like that happen.I think theyíre livid. I think theyíre outraged over this. I think the outrage originally was gonna be at Republicans for caving to all this. But now weíre past that, because one of the things I believe is truly happening is I think fence-sitters and casual news consumers ó people that are not ideologically involved like you and I are, people who are not so-called news junkies. I think theyíre watching this, and I think theyíre just getting livid. I think they are angry as they can be at this, because this episode as obvious unfairness. It has obvious indecency to it.It is obviously so outside the bounds of what our normal politics are that people canít escape this. In the process, the Drive-By Media is embarrassing itself ó and it began that in earnest with their coverage being one-sided anti-Trump. But you add all of these things to the Mueller investigation. All of this time, ìTrump colluded with Russia, but, no, thereís no evidence.î Every allegation the Democrat Party has made about political enemies for the last two years has had zero come to it. Nothing has come of it. The Russians didnít cheat, didnít help Trump.Trump didnít cheat with the Russians. There isnít any evidence of it. Now, the psychologically deranged left believes it, but Iím not talking about them. I still believe they are a minority. I think this episode ó and particularly today, with now the ìrape trainî story. Itís the first time in 35 years. Nobodyís ever heard about this. Weíre gonna bring a confirmation process to another screeching halt over an allegation that ó like every allegation the Democrats and the media has made for two years ó has nothing to it.Think about all of the stories since Trump won elected, just since then, with all of these anonymous deep state sources in the intelligence community, the law enforcement community, pretty much promising that evidence linking Trump and collusion with the Russians was immediately forthcoming. And none has been. And slowly and surely people are learning about the collusion within the FBI! Theyíre learning about the collusion of the FBI leadership with Hillary Clinton. This is aÖ To casual observers, it may hit them as a slow drip.Weíve gotten to the point where one too many slow drips is finally causing the faucet to be unleashed, because this is so far outside the bounds of what even our degraded politics has come to be in terms of normal. This is so even beyond that. This is so plain, flat-out indecent that these people can kiss their blue wave good-bye. I really doÖ I think that there is a simmering rage. Some of it might be at Republicans, but there is a simmering rage at Washington itself, and the Democrats are the focus of that rage. Every charge they make has nothing to it and is destroying people in the process. You wait and see if this doesnít manifest itself somehow.  "

So that óRUSH: What does that mean for us dropouts? What is a residential college?CALLER: (chuckles) They assign people to colleges. Thereís twelve colleges at Yale, or now thereís one more. At the time there were twelve, and thereís about 120 at each college and it just subdivides the grouping of the students so that they know each other more closely. They live in the same dormitories óRUSH: Okay, residential. Itís where you live. Okay. I just wanted to make sure.CALLER: Yeah. They get to know each other fairly well.RUSH: Right. Okay.CALLER: So if I had to describe Brett Kavanaugh that I knew from 1983 through 1987, I would describe him with one word as ìkind.î He is kind, he is gentle, he was gracious, he was thoughtful. He was never somebody I would ever think of as a quote ìpartier.î He was a good man, and Iím just offended that all of this coming out. I donít associate that at all with the person that I knew.RUSH: Were you afraid of him?CALLER: He was very soft-spoken, very, very thoughtful.RUSH: Were you ever afraid of him?CALLER: Never. Never! He was gentle. A sweetheart.RUSH: Well, howÖ? You had to know him pretty well, I mean, to make a judgment that he was gentle and a sweetheart. You wouldnít say that about somebody you would see walking on the quadrangle. I mean, youíd have to know them a little bit.CALLER: Right. No, we werenít close friends or besties or anything like that. You know, he was just another person in this group of 120 that all kind of know each other. Youíre the in dining hall together and óRUSH: Let me ask you this. Okay, 120 people. Were any of them, as you recallÖ? Was there any scuttlebutt, reputation, winks and nods, whispers, ìBe careful of this Kavanaugh guy. The guy, heís a snaky, sneaky, looks like this. But donít be in a room alone with himî? Was there ever anything like that?CALLER: Absolutely not. And if there had been, I would have known because it was a small group of people. No! He was just a normal, nice guy.RUSH: So all of this that youíre hearing about him, it has to sound like nothing you experienced or knew. It has to sound strange and almost incomprehensible?CALLER: Exactly. I even had two reporters contact me. The Huffington Post called me yesterday and itís so strange ícause I live in Wyoming out in the middle of nowhere and reporters do not usually call me of all people. (giggling)RUSH: Right.CALLER: Theyíre trying to get dirt on him. Iíve had this happen once over the summer, and the person who called ó the reporter ó in the middle of the summer, when I wasnít able to give her any dirt, she started to lead me, just like leading the witness. She started suggesting terrible things that I should say about him, and when I wasnít able to do that she started leading me down the road. ìCan I say anything negative about the groups that he participated in, you know, the clubs that he was a part of while he was at Yale?î Again, I wouldnít say anything negative about them as well. I didnít have anything negative to say but he was really offended. The reporters are calling me, of all people, to get negative things to come up with, and it really makes me suspicious that these women who are coming forward have had something similar to them done to them as well, that somebodyís leading them and spurring them on and urging them.RUSH: You said you had a call from the Huffing and Puffington Post yesterday?CALLER: I did.RUSH: Can you hang on?

Your call yesterday from the Huffing and Puffington Post, did they try the same thing yesterday? Did they try to lead you into answers they already had and were trying to get you to confirm?CALLER: Honestly, I sort of directed the conversation earlier than giving her a chance to do that. It was a very young girl. I did ask her age. She was 28 and I was thinking, ìThis girl doesnít know anything. She wasnít even around during the Clinton era. She (unintelligible) history here,î and when I talked with her about it I turned around all the questions back onto her and asked her (crosstalk) óRUSH: Give me an example of that. Give me an example of it.CALLER: So I talked about how the reporter who had called me in the summer had been very manipulative and was leading. I asked her, ìWhat does it mean to be a journalist and are you trying to create the news that you want to hear or are you actually asking about it and wanting to learn something honest and true and what is true?î So I think I probably surprised her with some of that. But (crosstalk) óRUSH: WhatÖ? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What did she say when you asked her if she wanted to actually make news or actually learn something?CALLER: Well, the reply to that was that we have to protect these women and that they have rights, too, from the angle of defending the woman. I talked about how in my opinion Brett Kavanaugh is the victim. He is truly the one being victimized, and I asked her how it would feel if you had worked all of your life and been a good person and had been conscientious and had done the right thing and had done something, a certain moment in your career been attacked wrongly, wrongly accused and how that would make her feel. Her response was that (garbled), well, he would still have a good job anyway. (laughing)RUSH: Okay. You know what?CALLER: (unintelligible)RUSH: Jenny, thank you for letting us call you back. This has been eye-opening, and I appreciate it. Just to review, she went to Yale at the same time Brett Kavanaugh was there, same residential college.

This is one of the reasons Kavanaughís fighting so hard. Look, if it survives ó if this outrage, if this perversion of truth, if this vile corruption survives ó and if it is, at the end of this process, considered true that Kavanaugh is a sexual predator, how does a sexual predator stay on the D.C. Circuit? This is not just to keep him off the Supreme Court. Theyíre trying to ruin this man and destroy his life, reputation, career, family, and future, folks.

The president just tweeted my comment, which means he endorses it. Look, I had no idea that it was going to be glommed onto by virtual every Drive-By Media outlet, but it has been.I said, ìIf Grassley waits long enough, the Democrats will come up with a woman claiming to be Kavanaughís secret Russian wife, that Trump paid Kavanaughís second wife to hire a bunch of prostitutes and urinate on the bed Obama slept in when he was in Moscow.î If they wait long enough, somebodyís gonna come up with that woman: Kavanaughís second wife whoís responsible for Trump prostitutes urinating on the bed in Moscow, from the dossier.

When the left gets involved in the rule of law, it changes to the accuser never has to prove anything.The accuser must be believed! The accused is automatically guilty and cannot exonerate himself no matter what he does. He should just go away and the Republicans should stop defending him. This isnít about power, this is about politics, and itís about the absolute bastardization of the rule of law. I alsoÖ They didnít play it in the clip. I said as part of my statement yesterday, ìSenator Grassley, you guys have done everything you could to show fairness!ìYouíve offered to fly out to her when she said she was nervous about coming to Washington because she canít fly.î Yet she somehow got to Hawaii! You have offered to have any number of ways for her to tell her story. You have made it abundantly clear you want to hear her story. You donít have to do any more to prove your fairness and your openness. The fact of the matter is this woman was never going to testify. Her lawyersÖThe point is not what she has to say. It never has been. The point is to stop and derail and delay the process here, hopefully beyond the elections that the Democrats think theyíre gonna win. So that then they can have a justifiable reason for not going forward with this, because theyíre gonna control the House and Senate come January, and they would not confirm this guy anyway. Thatís all this has ever been about is delaying and stopping.It only happens after the Democrats realized ó after going through millions of pages of documents of Kavanaugh writings and utterings and sayings ó that they have nothing on him. Only at the last minute did Dianne Feinstein leak this thing out, her letter, because they had exhausted every other attempt, legitimate attempt to get Kavanaugh. But he passed his own testimony with flying colors. He passed his exam.He passed six FBI background checks throughout the entire time he has been a federal judge. There is nothing that has been found to disqualify him. Itís quite the opposite. He is among the most qualified to ever be nominated for the United States Supreme Court, and that is the real problem, because he is a conservative. There is no justifiable reason to not go forward with this confirmation vote. The woman has been extended every opportunity and has failed to access and act on every I give you and opportunity.The Senate leadership has bent over and been flexible with all of the demands that her left-wing activist George Soros-funded lawyer have demanded. And after each supposed agreement, something happens, like a new accuser to make them say, ìWell, wait a minute. This is becoming a circus and my client doesnít feel safe. My client doesnít feel secure.î Yeah, your client also didnít want Kavanaugh in the room and wanted Kavanaugh to go first!That doesnít happen in any decent legal proceeding or society! The accused gets his day in court. But only after he knows what heís being accused of. And until she testifies to it, all the rest of this doesnít mean anything. Do you thinkÖ? Let me ask you. This a logical question. Do you think Christine Blasey Ford will ever go under oath? Well, Iím just asking, because once you do that, that changes everything.If you go under oathÖ Thereís a reason why it leaked out that she didnít want to go under oath. You go under oath? Hello, lawyers. You go under oath and make these allegations that you canít prove, that nobody can prove? I donít think it has ever been the case that Christine Ford was going to testify. I donít think they thought it would get to this point.I believe just like they thought that they would beat Trump and wipe Trump outÖ Just like they thought the Access Hollywood video would destroy Trumpís campaignÖ They thought all that they have done now with the Avenatti pile-on yesterday would force Kavanaugh for the sake of protecting his family and the rest of his life to say, ìScrew this,î and withdraw his nomination. He hasnít. He went on Fox last night and doubled down.Heís in it and heís gonna fight it side by side with Donald Trump. Thatís not supposed to happen. Kavanaugh-Trump are not behave according to the Kavanaugh script that they had dreamed of or imagined. So the idea that she hasnít been treated fairly is not true. They have established deadlines and she has missed them, and they changed the deadline! They have given her how many additional days to show up and testify, and each deadline comes and goes and another excuse is offered as to why she canít make it and another one is offered by Chairman Grassley.In my mind, the Republicans donít have a thing to prove in terms of showing their fairness and their legitimate desire to hear her! The president has said it would be wonderful if she testified. The Republicans have made it abundantly clear they want to hear what she has to say. The only person who has availed themselves of the opportunities that have been offered is the doctor. Dr. Ford. For whom the red carpet has been rolled out!She refuses to even drive up to the carpet and get out of the car and show up, and I donít think she ever intends to. Folks, she doesnít have any evidence. Thatís the one thing everybodyís forgetting. All we have here is an allegation or a series of them. The names that sheís given do not corroborate, people. She canít remember enough specifics. We get excuses for that. ìWell, thatís right, Mr. Limbaugh. Sheís so traumatized, that she, uhÖ She, uhÖ You know, she worked so hard to forget this, didnít ever want to remember it until Kavanaughís name was mentioned.îWell, how many years went by after Kavanaughís name was mentioned where this judge job and that job and so forth and she never came forward. She didnít come forward. She wasnít brought forward, however this happened, until the Democrats ran out of ammo. When the Democrats ran out of ammo, itís, ìHey, DiFi, you still have that letter? This is the time to drop it,î and so itís the Democrats who are the people that have put Christine Fordís identity in the public domain.It is they who have made her feel unsafe and insecure. By the way, who sends a letter of allegations like this and says, ìBy the way, I donít want you to do anything with this, and I donít want you to mention my name, and I donít want you moving this forward.î Who sends a letter like that? Do we even know, I dare ask, that she wrote this letter? Do we even know? How much do we really know? Iím asking that question not because I think anything.Iím just trying to focus everybody on how much do we know? The answer is zip! She doesnít have any evidence. When it looked like her turn at bat wasnít gonna produce a hit, here comes the Ramirez story from The New Yorker where we get the same thing! Nobody in that story can corroborate it. Thereís not a single eyewitnesses for what Ramirez says happened! So here comes Avenatti with the ìrape trainî story and a promise that within 48 hours one of his victims is gonna show up and be a witness.In the midst of all of this, Republicans have demonstrated an overwhelming, inarguable opportunity after opportunity for Dr. Ford to be heard, and it is Dr. Ford who has not accepted the invitations and taken advantage of the opportunity. The Republicans have got to somehow escape the thinking that overwhelms or takes in everyone in Washington and realize how their voters are seeing this. They see this for what it is. Itís a setup. Itís been a setup from the get-go.Weíve seen it before! How many times have we seen this in one form or another? How many times have they run scams like this? Just yesterday, the news media told us for seven hours that Rosenstein was going to the White House to quit before he was fired. No. It was a regularly scheduled meeting. Rosenstein wasnít fired, and now it might not be ítil Thursday. Now, Lisa Murkowski is starting to get wobbly out there.The Drive-Bys and the Democrats are still focusing on Susan Collins because it looks like now thereís not a single Democrat will vote for him. Thatís another thing. There are a lot of Democrats that were gonna vote for Kavanaugh when this all ended. Theyíre from red states. They donít want to anger the voters in those states who supported Trump by wide margins in the 2016 election. But they dredge this stuff all up, the Democrats thinking, ìHey, you know what? Weíve done so well that our red state Democrats donít need to vote for this nominee in order to save themselves.îSo now theyíre focusing on Murkowski, and MurkowskiÖ This was on CNN earlier today, one of their reporters, Manu Raju. He said, ìI just asked Senator Murkowski, key Republican swing vote, if there should be a full FBI investigation into allegations from Kavanaughís past. Murkowski said, ëWell, it would sure clear up all the questions, wouldnít it?'î Uh, no. (sigh) What is there to investigate? She canít remember where! She doesnít know what!She doesnít even remember the date. Sheís not even sure of the year. Weíre talking high school. Weíre talking 35 years ago. What and how does the FBI investigate this? Anybody? (interruption) Thatís right. Put Peter Strzok Smirk and Lisa Page on it and grab Andrew Weissmann from the Mueller team. By the way, I think, you know, this is not being widely commented upon, but I think thatís falling apart on íem, too!I think the Mueller thing is about to fall apart; I think Mueller knows it! Thereís nothing there! There wasnít any collusion! Michael Flynn ought to have all of his charges dropped; he ought not spend a single day in jail. Every charge against him lying to the FBI, everything, all of that stuff should be lifted. Theyíre literally after all this time theyíve got nothing! The left has nothing on Trump! Theyíve got nothing to Kavanaugh! And thatís not a wild guess.It is the state of play as we sit here today. Let me tell you something. If there were any evidence for thisÖ When Kavanaugh goes on television and says, ìI was a virgin all through high school and fromÖî Do you realize all itís gonna take is some Democrat to find a woman who was in high school and Kavanaugh to say, ìOh, no, he wasnít!î Donít be surprised if they try that. (interruption)What, do you think they wouldnít try that? (interruption) Well, the point is, why would Kavanaugh say it knowing it is so easily disproved? The Democrats go out and find anybody. What, ìDrag a dollar bill through a trailer park,î James Carville said. So go to a trailer park, drag a dollar bill, and whoever takes it, bring íem to Washington and have íem say, ìOh no! I had sex with the guy. He was not a virgin!îBREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Todd in Chapel Hill, Tennessee. Iím glad that you waited. Hi, sir. How are you?CALLER: Hey, Rush! Thank you for taking my call.RUSH: Yes, sir.CALLER: Hey, I justÖ Iím sure you already got it, but about 40 minutes ago President Trump tweeted your comments yesterday about Republicans can kiss the midterms good-bye.RUSH: I didnít know that óCALLER: Oh, okay.RUSH: ó until I saw your call here up on the board.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: And I started asking if what you were saying was accurate and it was. So they sent me the tweet and I now have it. So what was your reaction when you saw that?CALLER: Well, I mean, youíre exactly right. But what I wanted to ask your opinion about óRUSH: Yes.CALLER: ó is do you think Republicans behind the scenes are trying to make a deal where theyíll say, ìWeíll take Garland if you give us Kavanaugh in the near futureî?RUSH: Where have youÖ? Now, what Republicans and behind what scene is this discussion happening?CALLER: Well, Iím just thinking myself because I know how Republicans are; theyíre weak.RUSH: So you havenít heard this. You conjured this up on your own?CALLER: Yes. (chuckles)RUSH: Okay. Well, the only thing I can say about it is the Republicans can talk about all this they want, but itís the president that nominates people.CALLER: Right.RUSH: And unless heís in on the talksÖ But the Democrats areÖ In this climate, I donít see the Democrats goingÖ Let me tell you the truth of something here. If Scalia had passed away in any year other than the year he didÖ In other words, if Obama had a Supreme Court nomination not in an election year, he would have never nominated Merrick Garland! The secret here is the Democrats would never put Merrick Garland up if there was a Supreme Court opening and it was outside an election year.If they had the White House and if they had the Senate, Merrick Garland would never be nominated by the Democrats. Heís too moderate. Heís too old. The reason Obama named Merrick Garland is because he was as close to a secret, hidden progressive as you could get that might be confirmed. The Democrats wanted Scaliaís seat! They thought Merrick Garland would pass muster with the Republicans. But the Republicans remembered the Biden Rule.See, the DemocratsÖ The truth be known, the Democrats are having their rear ends bitten off by their own policies. Harry Reid nuked the filibuster so Supreme Court nominations canít be filibustered. They used to be able to be filibustered, but Harry Reid blew up the filibuster so that Obama could pack the courts. Not just Supreme Court, but district courts, appellate courts, and so forth and so on. So that tool is gone, and then back whenÖI forget who was president. But it was a Republican was president, Supreme Court opening came up, and Joe Biden (who was at the time a senator and he might have been chairman of the Judiciary Committee at the time) said (summarized), ìYou canít! A lame-duck president in the last year of his term canít nominate Supreme Court nominees. Thatís not right. Thatís not right, because the people canít vote on the president thatís gonna nominate him.îSo Mitch McConnell and the boys said, ìHey, weíre simply invoked the Biden Rule here on Merrick Garland. Obamaís in his swanís song year, and Joe Biden said way back when that you shouldnít have a Supreme Court nomination and a confirmation battle during a presidential election year, and so the Republicans didnít. The Democrats are fit to be tied. They think Merrick Garland was savaged and cheated out of a seat. They think they were cheated out of a seat.Republicans just used the Biden Rule, as in Joe Biden (nicknamed Joe Bite Me), the vice president for Obama. But the DemocratsÖ This is another thing. Theyíre running around acting like all of this is to get even for what was done to Merrick Garland. ìHe was really savagely treated, unfairly treated. It was mean what the Republicans did. He was a decent guy, would have been great on the court, but the Republicans said no; so this is payback.î Well, Iím just telling you.If Obama had a chance and nominated somebody when it was not an election year, he would not have picked Merrick Garland. Merrick Garland was never gonna be on the Supreme Court. Obama would have picked somebody very young, very ìprogressive,î very liberal, very communist who was gonna be on that court for 40 years. It was never gonna be Merrick Garland. So donít buy this crying over spilt milk over the savage, unfair deal that Merrick Garland got.The Republicans couldnít make that deal anyway because Trump would have to pick Merrick Garland. Youíd have to talk Trump into select Merrick Garland. The Democrats are not gonna sit by and let Kavanaugh get confirmed after all this. Theyíre gonna go down with the ship, whatever that means. The time to do thisÖ I know that the Republicans are worried about Murkowski fading away and dropping off and maybe Susan Collins. But the Turtle has been pretty fired up lately. Mitch McConnell on the floor of the Senate?I mean, he reached five on the Richter scale. Thatís when you and I just get up, our speed. His really fired up is how you and I feel just 30 seconds after waking up.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/25/democrats-didnt-expect-kavanaugh-to-fight-back/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 25, 2018RUSH: It gets more despicable, it gets more disgusting with the passing of each day. Judge Kavanaugh and his wife went on Fox News last night. I know there are different takes, different reactions to the interview that occurred, Martha MacCallum with Judge Kavanaugh and his wife. But Iím just gonna tell you: The fact that something like that even occurred with the subject matter that came up is itself despicable. It is just simply outrageous.It was uncomfortable to watch this. I knew exactly what was going on. And, by the way, it served a great purpose. Forget (sigh) whatever you thought of it. And Iím sure the reactions, the thoughts, the emotions to that run the gamut. But one thing that it did, I am a firm believerÖ Remember we had the story yesterday that this loose cannon, Avenatti, who is the lawyer for the stripper? Whatís her name out there? (interruption) Stormy Daniels. Yeah, Stormy Daniels.Oh, by the way, thereís a link on the Drudge Report that says the judge in that case is ready to toss her lawsuit on Trump on the basis that Trump had every right to what he wanted to say; it canít be actionable and so forth. The judge hasnít thrown it out yet, but the story says that heís on the verge of doing it. But Avenatti ó as we so (sigh) disgustingly shared with you yesterdayÖAvenatti said that within 48 hours he was gonna produce a witness that would testify to the fact that Kavanaugh and his buddy Mark Judge got women drunk while in college. They got them drunk and gave them pills and started a ìrape trainî for their male buddies. He said he was gonna produce this witness in 48 hours. He was demanding to be heard by the committee. He was demanding to testify and so forth. Today, his Twitter account is locked.Iíll tell you what I think. I think much of what the left has been doing has been designed to get Kavanaugh to throw in the towel. I think theyíve wanted Kavanaugh to quit and I think theyíve been trying to get Trump to pull the nomination. So thereís Kavanaugh and his wife last night on Fox saying (summarized), ìI was a virgin. Iím a good Catholic boy. I was a virgin long after high school. I didnít do any of this stuff.î People watching this are saying, ìGee!îOh, by the way, you know what else Iíve learned? Have you noticed (ícause I have)Ö? Have you noticed, watching all this, that the left and the Drive-Bys are using the word ìpenisî more and more and more whenever theyíre discussing this kind of thing? Do know why? Apparently thereís polling data ó and you women are gonna have to back this up because itís just polling data, and you know what I think of polling data.Polling data is that women hate the word. They just despise the word, and they react negatively to the word. And thatís why this dildo story is all over the Ramirez story, Kavanaugh rubbing the dildo in the face, whatever. This is justÖ (Snort!) Itís so beneathÖ It is so beneath the so-called professed dignity and civility that the left is always demanding, and look where theyíre taking us. Anyway, so I think, you know, Avenattiís claim of a ìrape trainî?I think one of the purposes of that was to make and Kavanaughís team say, ìFor crying out loud, this isnít worth it. Come on! Who are you kidding? Iím not gonna stand there and defend myself against thisÖî They wanted him to drop out. Now that he hasnít ó instead of dropping out, he goes on Fox and he does the interview and he spends all this time backing up his character and so forth ó I donít think that was what the left expected. I really think they thought that he was gonna bug out. Theyíre not in touch with reality.They really do believe ó and I thought they believed ó that Kavanaugh, they could make him quit and make Trump pull the nomination. I still donít think that Christine Blasey Fordís gonna testify Thursday. I donít think sheís gonna ever testify. But people can disagree. But weíve already gotÖ You know, Feinstein is already talking about canceling the hearing on Thursday. Now theyíre upset the Republicans have gone out and hired an independent female lawyer who is an expert in sexual abuse cases interviewing.The left says, ìNo, no, no, no! WeÖ No, no, no, no, no. We want Republican senators doing it.î Of course they do. He want to set it up where these old white senators are berating and demeaning the and range of motion gutsy and ballsy Christine Ford, and so theyíre balking. And I told you yesterday, ìBy the time we get there itís gonna be ëunsafeí and not conducive to her testifying.î I think sheís still balking. Sheís still trying to get it arranged so she wouldnít have to go under oath and all that.Remember yesterday you couldnít believe it when I said that I didnít think she would testify? (interruption) You thought it was gonna happen. You still think itís gonna happen? You justÖ (interruption) You justÖ (interruption) You justÖ (interruption) Yeah. Donít doubt my track record. Donít doubt my tract record. In the audio sound bites, my warning to Republicans that if they cave on this, that they can kiss the midterms good-bye. The Drive-Bys loved it. It was all over cable news yesterday afternoon and last night.Now, folks, before getting into any more specifics of this particular incident ó and there are updates, of course ó there are two pieces here that I want to share with you that are I think foundational in terms of helping to understand what weíre up against. What has become of the American left? Who is the American left? Why are they the way they are? I have opined recently that decent people just donít have any idea how to deal with this.Decent people do not wallow in muck. Decent people do not sit around and try to anticipate whatís gonna come next from the indecent among us. They live their lives. They try to do the best they can. Everybody faces obstacles in life. They do their best at overcoming them. Some do well; some donít. But decent people are not obsessed with whatís coming next week from the indecent side, and the indecent side is devoted to nothing but shock and awe as a means of forcing their indecency and perversion and all on society and having it accepted as normal.I have been back and forth in my mind trying to come up with ways to explain what I think the left is, who they are. And the closest Iíve come to it is my detailed and inarguable explanations and definitions of victimhood, victimology, and how we got there and what it means for society at large.  "

The mainstream media is not reporting any of this. If it werenít for Fox News, this would never have appeared on TV. There are three excerpts of three emails sent to Amy Kavanaugh, and Iím gonna read them to you. Iím gonna give you a countdown. Iím not gonna say the unmentionable words, but youíll know what they are.But if youíre listening with young ears that you donít want to hear, Iím gonna count down from five, and you should turn the radio off for, like, 45 seconds and come back. Ready? FiveÖ FourÖ Remember, when I get to one, if you still listen and you find it objectionable and complain, it will fall on deaf ears because you have been warned. Ready? ThreeÖ TwoÖ OneÖ Email sent to Amy Kavanaugh: ìPlease tell your rapist, lying, cheating, corrupt bóh of a husband to put a bullet in his ugly fóñg skull.î Another email to Amy Kavanaugh: ìHey bóh, did you know your husband was a rapist before you married him?îAnother email to Amy Kavanaugh: ìYOUR HUSBAND IS A LIAR, THIEF, RAPIST AND PROBABLY A PEDOPHILE. BURN IN HELLÖî What was the proudest day in the Kavanaugh familyís life was ruined by a circus of protesters welcomed into the hearing room by the Democrat Party. Remember the picture of Mr. and Mrs. Kavanaugh, the parents, with their heads buried in their hands? They were ashamed on the day that should have been one of the proudest days of their lives. The left: smile, with laughter and with glee. Kavanaughís young daughters were there and had to witness it as well, not to mention his wife.Now Democrat voters are sending this stuff to Brett Kavanaughís wife, and still they hang in for this nomination because Brett Kavanaugh is a patriot, in addition to being a brilliant scholar and legal mind. My point is exactly this: This is the Democrat base, and they are demanding this treatment of Kavanaugh. The Democrat Party expects to be rewarded by their base with massive turnout. They believe independents are so outraged at what Kavanaugh has done ó theyíre so mad at what Kavanaugh has gotten away with ó they canít wait to show up and vote against him.Everybody wants to vote against Kavanaugh really because everybody hates Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Donald Trump draws tens of thousands of people at every rally he attends with double that number outside unable to get in. Barack Obama canít draw more than 700 people to his rallies, and Iím not making that up. Itís 700 people max. And then Michael Moore. Michael Moore has this new movie called Fahrenheit 11/9. I guess heís run out of creativity.Fahrenheit 9/11 was his first movie, anti-Bush. It did well, got an Oscar for the thing. So time to go back to the drawing board, rework it for Trump. Fahrenheit 11/9. Guess what? Up there at the Toronto Film Festival, itís voted the eighth or ninth best flick of all of those that were shown, and its opening weekend tanked at $3 million taken in with over a thousand screens. Now, does that add up to a big blue wave?I mean, you would think that these Democrats demanding this kind of depraved behavior from their elected Democrats, cannot wait to get out there and vote. Then why arenít they showing up for Mooreís movie? And why arenít more than 700 showing up for the great Obama as he embarks on whatever heís doing? Yeah, Michelle Obama supposedly doing pretty well on the book tour. But note that Michelle Obamaís totally into Michelle Obama, not this other stuff. Sheís out selling herself, not bashing Trump per se by design and by purpose. So I donít know. Is there a backlash out there thatís waiting to be? Are decent women fed up with what the Democrats are doing or not?You hope, but you just donít know.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Samantha. Samantha in Franklin, Tennessee. Youíre next.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/24/kavanaughs-letter-to-the-committee-i-will-not-be-intimidated/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 24, 2018RUSH: In this letter that Kavanaugh has written ó and the White House released this. So this is not Kavanaugh independently. The White House is standing by Kavanaugh.Trump is standing by Kavanaugh. In this letter to Grassley and Feinstein, Kavanaugh says, ìI will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out.î It begins, ìDear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: When I testified in front of the Senate three weeks ago, I explained my belief that fair process is foundational to justice and to our democracy.ìAt that time, I sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee for more than 31 hours and answered questions under oath. I then answered more questions at a confidential session. The following week, I responded to more than 1,200 written questions, more than have been submitted to all previous Supreme Court nominees combined.î Twelve hundred! One-thousand-two-hundred questions! Thatís ìmore than have been submitted to all previous Supreme Court nominees combined.ìOnly after that exhaustive process was complete did I learn, through the news media, about a 36-year-old allegation from high school that had been asserted months earlier and withheld from me throughout the hearing process. First, it was an anonymous allegation that I categorically and unequivocally denied. Soon after the accuser was identified. I repeated my denial on the record and made clear that I wished to appear before the committee. I then repeated my denial to committee investigators ó under criminal penalties for false statements.ìI asked to testify before the committee again under oath as soon as possible, so that both Dr. Ford and I could both be heard. I thank Chairman Grassley for scheduling that hearing for Thursday. Last night, another false and uncorroborated accusation from 35 years ago was published. Once again, those alleged to have been witnesses to the event deny it ever happened. There is now a frenzy to come up with something ó anything ó that will block this process and a vote on my confirmation from occurring.ìThese are smears, pure and simple. And they debase our public discourse. But they are also a threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination ó if allowed to succeed ó will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from service.î Thatís right, and thatís exactly what the left wants. Make no mistake. The left would be happy if all decent people punted and said, ìI want nothing to do with government.î Nothing would make them happier.Judge Kavanaugh is exactly right about that. He continues, ìAs I told the committee during my hearing, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. That is the kind of judge I will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out.ìThe last-minute character assassination will not succeed. I have devoted my career to serving the public and the cause of justice, and particularly to promoting the equality and dignity of women. Women from every phase of my life have come forward to attest to my character. I am grateful to them. I owe it to them, and to my family, to defend my integrity and my name. I look forward to answering questions from the Senate on Thursday. Sincerely, Brett M. Kavanaugh.îWell, he may be there, but heíll be the only witness. Meaning, I donít think Dr. Ford will show up ó and particularly now. Sheís got more reason not to show up. ìKavanaugh simply refuses to go away! Kavanaugh simply will not admit it. Therefore, I canít! I canítÖ I canítÖ I donít feel safe with him there. No, I canít. I wonít. Especially since Kavanaugh gets to go last.î How about her stipulated conditions? (summarized) ìNot under oath. Kavanaugh goes first. Kavanaugh canít be in the room when I am.îYeah, it was a demand! If they agreed to thatÖ Well, they didnít. They havenít. (Ahem.) They didnít. But thatís what I meant in the first hour. They are standingÖ I donít know any other way to say it. America, the United States of America is an exceptional, different, and unique country for a host of reasons. At the top of the list of those reasons is our system of justice. The rule of law. The rule of law is what equalizes everybody in the eyes of justice ó which are blind, by definition.And it is fundamental in our system that anybody accused is presumed innocent and the people doing the accusing have to prove it. In tinhorn dictatorships, in communist countries and totalitarian regimes, it is true that the accused is automatically guilty. This is what the left seeks, particularly in politicized events, and since theyíve politicized everything, this is what they seek. Once accused, a conservative is guilty and will be denied (if they can do it) a chance to prove innocence.But regardless, the accused is guilty. The accuser need not provide evidence. The accuser need not provide corroboration. The word of the accuser is all that is needed, particularly in politicized events involving men and women. That stands America on its head. If that ever became our rule of law, that would be the end of the rule of law. Itíd be the end of America as you and I know it in the criminal justice system. It would be the end of any effort to exonerate oneself against any charge, false, legitimate, what have you.The burden has always been on the accuser, the prosecutor to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. What the left is angling for is outside of court, the establishment that in politicized events the accuser is always right because they are always going to be the accusers. It is part of their politics to accuse their opponents of crimes. Including, thinking differently is a crime. Being conservative has become a crime on the left ó a prosecutable, punishable offense.Witness A for this is Brett Kavanaugh. Prior to him, it was Judge Bork. Then came Clarence Thomas. So the American justice system is in the process of being stood upside down, and itís been taking place in our educational system. I donít know how many generations. At least one. You know, a generation is 20 to 25 years. So maybe, maybe as many as two generations of young people have been taught today that the American system of justice is destroying conservatives.Conservatives equal old white men who need to shut up finally and go away and let everybody clean up the mess that they have made of the world! So the American system of justice, as taught to young skulls full of mush, is destroying conservatives, however and whenever. That is what young people have been taught justice is, and thatís why such treatment of Kavanaugh is applauded. Itís considered to be justice, because Kavanaughís guilty. Heís a conservative, and that means he did whatever the left thinks of all conservatives.ìHe did it because heís conservative! Conservatives abuse women. Conservatives oppose women and minorities. Conservatives want you to suffer. Conservatives this and that.î This is what people have been taught. I want to ask some of you a question. I know youíll never be able to answer it, but I just want you to see the answer for yourselves in your lives. I got a note recently from a new grandmother. A womanís daughter has just given birth to twins, and the woman told me that her daughterís friends ó not her daughter ícause her daughterís twins were girls.She told me that young Millennial new mothers feel very bad that their children are boys in the age of Weinstein and all of these sexual abusers. Now, stop and think about that. They are disappointed that their child is a boy. Now, these are women who had the baby; so I know what youíre thinking. ìWell, maybe they might start aborting.î Yeah, nothing would surprise me on that side of the score. But just the fact that because of media coverage of Weinstein representing all menÖ See, this is what the left does!WeinsteinÖ Even though heís a liberal Democrat, even though heís a Clintonista, Weinstein has come to represent all men. Ditto, Leslie Moonves at CBS. Theyíre all liberal Democrats. Bill Clinton, liberal Democrat. These are all guys who did it! Bill Cosby, liberal Democrat! Theyíre all liberal Democrats. The guys who did it! Clarence Thomas didnít do it. Kavanaugh didnít do it. But because of the coverage of this by the Drive-Bys ó and no doubt what these women were taught in womenís studies classes ó they now feel remorseful that their child is a little boy.They were heard to say that theyíre gonna have to work really hard to raise a good young man. This is how subtle it is. So young mothers think that they are raising young predators in waiting, and theyíre frightened by it. Now, who could make that happen? Who could cause that kind of an attitude among young mothers? Yep! Thatís right. The American left and the Drive-By Media. Anyway, as to Brett Kavanaugh, thank God for his spine. Thank God for his backbone and his stick-to-itiveness and hisÖ Well, he likes himself.Heís not ashamed, heís not embarrassed, heís got nothing to apologize for ó and he is a perfect nominee from Donald Trump in this regard. It will have no effect on the left, by the way. They will twist and turn his letter into confirmation that the allegations are true. ìWhy else would he be so panicked?î they will say. ìWhy else would he go to such great lengths to defend himself if it werenít true?î they will say. Iíve been there. Iíve seen it. This is how they react.ìLook! We got Kavanaugh! He wrote a letter. Heís now denying it. That means we got him,î and theyíll start on this new thing that Kavanaugh has now admitted his culpability with this flat-out denial. ìHe must be worried that people are believing it,î they will say. Thatís how it all works. I understand also that Senator Orrin Hatch is really, really angry at all of this last-minute charade behavior going on by the accusers and their sponsors. I hope heís not the only one.  "

If Grassley waits long enough, the Democrats will come up with the woman claiming to be Kavanaughís secret Russian wife. ó heís a bigamist, too, donít you know ó and Trump paid Kavanaughís second wife to hire a bunch of prostitutes to urinate on the bed Obama slept in while in Moscow.If Grassley doesnít get a handle on this and just do ó and Iíll tell you something else, which everybody also knows. If the Republicans do not get this vote taken and have Kavanaugh confirmed, you can kiss the midterms goodbye. You can kiss goodbye holding the House and you can kiss goodbye holding the Senate. Because whatever the Democrats think of their base, the one thing I know that if you guys fold on this and cave and keep bending over backwardsÖ Youíve done that enough. Youíve demonstrated that you donít hate women.Youíve demonstrated that youíre open minded. Youíve demonstrated that youíre gonna hear from her. Youíre never gonna hear from her!

If you guys donít conduct this vote in defiance of all this and if Avenatti gets one foot in the door to a Senate committee to start telling his story, then you can kind of kiss good-bye Republican chances in the midterms in November.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/20/trump-flipped-the-script-with-reaction-to-kavanaugh-accuser/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 20, 2018RUSH: So Iím just watching CNN. I want to be able to explain this to you exactly as I just heard this. So Iím watching an infobabe report from the White House to Wolf Blitzer at CNN. The thrust of her report is how shocked ó get this, now ó how shocked and stunned Trumpís aides are at how respectful heís been to the accuser. Not the media and others, but the people that work for Trump. This infobabe said the people who work for Trump in the White House, Trumpís aides, have been blown away by how polite and accepting and gentle and nice he has been to the accuser.They were stunned by it. And then she said that Trump has noticed that the coverage heís getting on this has been that much better precisely because heís been a nice guy toward the accuser. So Trump aides told CNN that they now expect this to affect Trump in the long term, that heís going to now try to be a nice guy as often as he can because he likes the media coverage. Then she said to Wolf Blitzer, ìBut, Wolf, the real reason the president is so happy is because he is not the accused.ìThe president is used to being the accused in these sexual harassment matters, and heís just so grateful that heís not the accused, that he is treating this in a responsible and reasonable way.î And then she said (chuckles) but this could all blow up on the president tonight because, Wolf, as we know, the president will be leaving in a short while for a rally in Las Vegas where heís going to be stumping for a Senate candidate out there. And as you know, Wolf, at these rallies is where the president is unscripted and goes off message and has a tendency to be who he really is.Implying that all of this niceness and politeness to the accuser could go out the window tonight when Trump goes off script and he could once again start insulting everybody left and right. So weíll just have to keep a sharp eye on it, Wolf. You know, the president gets in these rallies with his supporters, and they egg him on, and he loves it, and he likes saying things that gets them all worked up. I was laughing myself silly. I just broad smile on my face watching this. And TrumpÖYou know, they talked about Obama ó the left did and the media did ó trying to tell us that Obama is so much smarter than everybody that we just canít keep up, that if life is a game of chess, you know, heís five or six moves ahead of everybody, that nobody can play in his league. Weíre just lucky. Weíre lucky to be among the countenance and the aura of Barack Hussein Obama. Let me tell you something. Let me tell you whoís five or six moves ahead of people, and thatís Trump. They are the ones shocked, not Trumpís aides.They are shocked at Trumpís behavior here ó and Iíll bet you, I will bet you that part of the calculus here ó because this accuser is not alone, folks. She didnít come alone. She didnít spring up alone. She didnít decide to do this in a vacuum. Just like Anita Hill. Thereís a silent group of people, an army behind the accuser who are helping and cajoling and directing and producing. I guarantee you ó do not doubt me on this ó that one of the things they thought they had going for them in having this woman come forward would be that Trump would savage her.I will guarantee you thatís what they thought. I will guarantee you thatís what they planned for. I will guarantee you thatís what they expected and hoped, that when this, ícause Trump loves his nominees. He loves Kavanaugh. They were convinced that Trump would take this attack on his nominee personally as though it were an attack on him and he would lash out and he would start insulting via Twitter and anywhere else what he thinks of this woman.They figured that if they could get Trump to do that, it would further the objective of getting rid of Kavanaugh. ëCause I think they have been hoping that Trump or somebody close to him would start ó for lack of a better word ó trashing Christine Blasey Ford. I think they were expecting some Republicans to do that. And, by the way, I think weíve been expecting some in the media to do that. (Ahem. Ahem. Ahem!) I think they have been openly monitoring ó by the second ó waiting for any even outrageously wrong example where anybody in conservative media could be said to be speaking disrespectfully, unseriously, insultingly, or whatever.I have no doubt, ícause I know these people. I have no doubt that has been part of the calculus. So many things here that they counted on are not happening. The president is not ridiculing her. The president is not treating her with disrespect. The president is not insulting her and neither is anybody else. The Republicans have made it plain theyíre eager to hear what she has to say. Trump himself has said her testifying would be wonderful; he wants to hear it. The presidentís even said that if sheís credible, that his nominee would be in trouble.Grassley has tried every which way to cajole her into speaking, offered her behind closed doors, on the record, off the record. He even volunteered to go out to where she is. They bent over backwards to let her know they want to know what she has to say and that they will listen to it, and theyíve done so with tremendous respect for her. Whatís it led to? Itís led to Mazie Hirono flipping out and starting to use curse words about the Republicans and men in general.Kirsten Gillibrand could barely keep it together. These Democrats are going bonkers ícause theyíre not getting the expected behavior they wanted from Trump or the Republicans in the Senate or some in the media. They were hoping people would jump all over this woman like some did Anita Hill, and it just isnít happening. So the strategerizing that they did in their calculations of whether or not to do this?They really counted on a boorish, mean-spirited reaction to this woman from Republicans that they are not getting ó and now the onus has flipped and the onus is now on Christine Blasey Ford to show up and start testify, and she wonít do it, and thatís whyÖ Grab audio sound bite No. 6. David ìRodhamî Gergen, heíll be followed by Jeffrey Toobin last night on CNN. Gergen on with Erin Burnett talking about whether she should testify on Monday.GERGEN: I do think that she should come and testify under protest and to óCOOPER: Mmmph!GERGEN: ó lay out the case why itís unfair, to ask for some more time, and then lay out her ó her views. There are an awful lot of women this country who ó who are pulling for her, and I think she has someÖ Sheís taken on some responsibilities as a citizen to her fellow women to make the best case she can for why this is being railroaded through, why it was inappropriate, this wasnít fair, why she did what she did. She could be a very sympathetic witness.RUSH: See? See. She has a dutyÖ What is this? ìShe has a duty to her fellow women, as a citizen, responsibilities as a citizen to her fellow women.î Itís sad that we are becoming so segregated here by virtue of surface things ó skin color, gender. Well, thatís not surface, but all this identity predicts stuff. Weíre not unified. Weíre going the exact opposite way and itís assisted along by this kind of thinking. ìFellow women.îLetting down her fellow women? Thatís the point. I guarantee you David ìRodhamî Gergen wouldnít be saying any of this if they had gotten the expected reaction they hoped from President Trump or from any Republican. Just a single, just one Republican senator, all one Republican senator they donít come out and start questioning her honesty and all that and it would have been over. But they studiously avoided this. So the Democrats havenít gotten what they wanted out of this so far, especially her testifying.There isnít any testimony.All there is is a letter that Feinstein wonít even let Grassley see!Have you heard that? Grassley has been asking Feinstein to let him see her original letter, and she will not produce it for him. This is the ranking member of this committee! Sheís got the letter that started all this, and she wonít let the other committee members on the Republican side see it! So we donít have any testimony! We just have a letter that Grassley canít even see because she wonít show it to him. Hereís Jeffrey Toobin last night with Anderson Cooper, who said, ìBoth sides clearly seem to be digging their heels in here, Jeffrey.îTOOBIN: Thatís true! And I think there is a factual matter that is worth putting out on the table. If she refuses to testify on Monday, Kavanaugh is getting confirmed. If she, you know, maintains that this investigation is a sham and Iím not taking part, he is getting confirmed. Now, that may be unfair. That may not a good thing or bad thing. I think thatís just a factual thing. If she does testify, then he think all the cards are up in the air. He may well be confirmed anyway. But I think everybody should be clear about what the stakes are of her decision to come forward or not before the committee.RUSH: See? Theyíre starting to have doubts. Now theyíre starting to talk about Kavanaugh. ìHe might be confirmed anyway!î This has not played out the way they thought it would. It has not played out the way they structured it. By the way, folks, do not doubt me on this. None of this thatís happening here is improv. Every bit of this was orchestrated with her original lawyer playing a central role, this Debra Katz. Sheís a longtime Democrat activist and fundraiser, and all these people have ties that go way back to both the Clintons and Obama.None of this is improv. This woman did not write this letter without anybody knowing it was gonna happen, and Dianne Feinstein didnít receive this letter not knowing it was coming and then when she got this letter kept it to herself. This is a plan that hasÖ In fact, we had a caller earlier this week, and I actually have been thinking about this. I think that this whole thing here might actually have had its origins during the Romney presidential campaign when Romney was the first to mention Kavanaugh as a possible Supreme Court pick.And I think once his name surfaced officially in that regard, the Democrats get in gear and start laying the groundwork for their destruction campaign for any nominee that any Republican might name ó and that would go back to 2012. Donít believe that any of this is improv. Donít believe it just happened. Very little of what happens on the left, particularly with media involvement, happens spontaneously or any kind of improvisationally.This is all part of a campaign. Everything they do is. So when Karen Tumulty says that itís a long time between now and Monday, and there could be additional people that pop up. Like there could be further evidence of people speaking up for Kavanaugh. There could be other women between now and Monday who say that it happened to them. Let me ask you this. You think if the Democrats are gonna hatch this plan and theyíve strategized. They expect Trump to respond in a certain way, itís gonna help them, and he hasnít.They expect conservative media to respond a certain way to help íem; we havenít. They expect Republicans to somehow start trashing her. It hasnít happened. Do you think that they donít have somebody in the bullpen? Do you think theyíve always had somebody in the bullpen? ëCause, believe me, thisÖ I donít know how else to say it, but this is not a spontaneous thing that caught everybody by surprise. I mean, even the people on the left.So when you have a Drive-By Media specialist, a veteran who has been in there many, many moons talking about the possibility that there could be other women, itís a pretty safe bet she already knows that they are. If there are, they are part of the plan too. Now, it could be that theyíve had to improvise since it hasnít gone their way. They maybe have had to go find a couple in the past week or so. But now the Democrats and the media starting to get a little depressed here. Sheís letting down her fellow women.She owes it to her fellow women as a citizen to come testify ó and even if she does, Kavanaugh may be confirmed anyway, said David ìRodhamî Gergen. No! That was Toobin. And one other bite. This is Fran Townsend, Fran Townsend national security adviser, defense specialist and so forth all the way back to the George W. Bush administration. She was on CBS today. Sheís a counterterrorism adviser, and she was talking to Gayle King who said, ìAs a former federal prosecutor, Fran, would you put a witness on the stand without some type of investigation?îTOWNSEND: Iíd take you back to the Anita Hill example; right?KING: Mmm-hmm!TOWNSEND: Thatís an example where President George H. W. Bush did reopen the investigation based on her allegations, and look at how those 302s were used. It were usedÖ It was a brutal, brutal cross-examination of her in public. Iím not sure thatís a model weíd really want to follow.KING: Are you saying an FBI investigation might actually not even be helpful to her at this point?TOWNSEND: Thatís exactly right! Look, and I donít think itís helpful. You know, sheíd asked for ó she through her lawyer as asked for ó this FBI investigation, and I think it makes her look political. I feel for her. Itís taken real courage for her to step up here. But I think she ought to tell her story.RUSH: ìShe ought to tell her story.î Yeah, what is this business of wanting the FBI to look into it? Could it be that people on the left now look at the FBI as simply another arm of their political operation and they see the FBI as a bunch of sympathetic supporters, and so calling for the FBI to investigate is like calling for Peter Strzok to start looking for spies in the Trump campaign after heís planted them there?I wouldnít doubt that, either, these people thinking they now own the FBI based on what weíve all learned the FBI did trying to screw Trump. So if her advisers are of the opinion the FBI is on her side, then damn, yeah! Call for an FBI investigation. Fran Townsend said (summarized), ìWait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You just never know whatís gonna turn up in one of those things, and once the FBI starts poking around, you canít say, ëAh, sorry! I really donít want to talk to you,í when youíre the one who asked for it.î  "

They believe their polls. They donít have the slightest idea what a potential backlash they are creating with their behavior here and what theyíre doing to Kavanaugh. They havenít the slightest idea. They have no idea of the rage! They think the Democrats have all the motivation and inspiration, eagerness to vote?They have no idea what this is doing to Republican turnout. No idea at all. We saw a harbinger of it in a Texas special election last night where a Republican won a Democrat seat that the Democrats have held for 139 years, and the polls did not say this was gonna happen. Democrats think theyíre in the process turning Texas blue, and yet this one seat that theyíve held in a district that went heavily for Hillary elected a Republican.Theyíre sitting there blind as a bat. They have no concept, they have no sense, because theyíre not connected to the American people. They have no idea how their behavior here is revving up Republicans to vote in November like nothing else could! You wait. Weíll see.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Last night on the Fox News Channel The Ingraham Angle, the host, Laura Ingraham had pollster Frank Luntz on there asking him about the allegations against Kavanaugh and how is it gonna play in the midterms. Her question to Luntz, ìFrom the people youíre talking to out there, Frank, how will it this Kavanaugh circus play out in midterms?îLUNTZ: It does appear she isnít gonna testify. The American people believe in fairness and they believe that everyone deserves their day in court. They want to hear what she had to say. She leveled some very, uh, strong allegations. But Iíll tell you that one of the big questions among the men I talked to is how far back are you going to hold someone accountable for the behavior that they did? Is what someone did when youíre 17Ö? Is that applicable to what someoneís life will be when theyíre in their fifties.RUSH: Yeah, itís a great, great question. Remember Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill she was alleging activity that occurred 10 years prior. This is 36 priors when both are in high school, for crying out loud. The first thing that should have disqualified it, the first thing that should have. Anyway, Luntz says that he senses the American people out there really think all this is unfair and could bode poorly for the Democrats. Next thing, Ingram of The Ingraham Angle said, ìYou know, I think that word ëfairnessí that you use, that cuts right to it. You canít lob these allegations and expect that you wonít get any questions about yourself because people are being mean to you online!îLUNTZ: Thatís why the Democrats have used Anita Hill, because they realized within 24 hours that this story was turning, that people were starting to wonder why is she backing off? Why? When you make a claim as significant of this, that youíre not willing to back it up at that hearing. What you could have is what happened to Donald Trump in 2016. You know he won a majority of white women ó and everyone thought that because of what had happened during the campaign, he would crater. In this situation, you may see women angry that theyíre being used, that theyíre being scapegoated, that theyíre being pulled into a political process that they want no part of. Make no mistake: Authenticity matters more than anything in 2016 [sic], and this doesnít seem authentic right now.RUSH: And the reason for that is that she wonít show up and testify, and people donít understand that. They can offer all excuses that they want. But she wroteÖ You know, she needs more time because sheís been trying to forget this? She wrote this in quite a detailed fashion in the Washington Post. See, this is whereÖ Iím sorry. Thereís a lot of this that I question. I question this idea that sheís been trying to forget it all of her life and is now being forced into remembering it.If anybodyís doing that, that process was started by Democrats ó which is gonna be lost on everybody. But sheís been working on remembering this since the beginning of June! And if she didnít to want remember it, if she didnít want this, why send Feinstein the letter in the first place? Thereís so much of this that doesnít pass a smell test just in terms of common sense and believability.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, my friends, thereís one other thing that about this that flies in the face of my prediction of the Democrats creating a major backlash here and that is a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The Reuters/Ipsos poll says that the public support for Kavanaugh is at its all-time low, that the American peopleís support for Kavanaugh is dwindling. Opposition to Kavanaugh is growing; his support is at an historic low.ìA growing number of Americans said they opposed President Donald Trumpís Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, as the candidateís confirmation hearings took place and as he fended off a sexual assault claimÖ The September 11-17 poll found that 36% of adults surveyed did not want Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court, up 6 points from a similar poll conducted a month earlier. Only 31% of U.S. adults polled said they were in favor of Kavanaughís appointment.îNow, I want you to think about something. Weíre talking here about one of the foremost legal scholars in the country, acknowledged by people from across the political spectrum. Weíre talking about somebody with impeccable integrity and honor as testified to by everybody that knows him. Weíre talking about an appellate court judge whose opinions are cited often by Supreme Court justices in their opinions. Weíre talking about an appellate court judge whose clerks with hired by Supreme Court justices more than any other judgeís clerks.Weíre talking about perhaps one of the judicial minds of a lifetime, a man who has led an unquestioned life of decency until this smear campaign started. Yet Reuters has a poll that says two-thirds of the country does not think heís fit to be on the Supreme Court. Now, what does that mean? If we believe this poll, if this poll is accurate, all that is really showsÖ It doesnít show what people know about Kavanaugh. What it shows is the power of the media over reality or it shows the power of the media and their ability to use polls to create news, to shape public opinion rather than reflect it. Only 31% of adults in the Reuters poll think Kavanaughís worth being on the court, 36% donít, and in terms of the just textbook qualifications, there isnít anybody better.  "

Did Christine Blasey Ford not tell her anything and sheís now just learning as other women in the community come forward and say, ìOh, yeah! Oh, yeah!î Okay. ìBut not with Brett Kavanaugh! Not with Brett Kavanaugh.î It would have been an ideal time to say, ìOh, yeah. Brett Kavanaugh was widely known.îBut she didnít, did she?She makes a point here.She wants to be perfectly clear she didnít know a thing about Brett Kavanaugh even when sheís describing what this stuff that happened was, ìNot Brett Kavanaugh. Not him.î  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/19/abortion-at-root-of-kavanaugh-attack/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 19, 2018RUSH: Letís review something that I said because there are many reasons why this is happening, and some of them are coequals. The primary reason is to delay the confirmation because they donít want Kavanaugh on the court because of his judicial qualifications and beliefs.They also donít want any conservative on the court because they really want to be able to maintain control over a womanís womb, and they want to be able to determine what happens to occupants of a womanís womb. And theyíre afraid that Kavanaughís gonna come along and overturn Roe v. Wade, which is not going to happen. But they canít take the chance that it wonít. There are many reasons why this is happening. Yesterday on the program, I outlined one of them.RUSH ARCHIVE: What do you think the bullís-eye really is here? What do you think has the Democrats so paranoid, so frightened, so agitated, so animated and motivated to stop this guy? What is it? (interruption) Well, yeah, but why? I know they donít want him on the court. Itís one word. It begins with an A. This is all about abortion. It is about nothing else as far as the left is concerned. They want to be able to continue uninterrupted with their behavior when it comes to abortion. Sex without consequence, life without consequence. They are scared to death that a Republican or a conservative majority is going to overturn Roe vs. Wade.RUSH: But in addition to that (and this canít be said enough) they really believe theyíre gonna win the Senate, folks. They believe their polls. They donít have the slightest idea what a potential backlash they are creating with their behavior here and what theyíre doing to Kavanaugh. They havenít the slightest idea. They have no idea of the rage! They think the Democrats have all the motivation and inspiration, eagerness to vote?They have no idea what this is doing to Republican turnout. No idea at all. We saw a harbinger in a Texas special election last night where a Republican won a Democrat seat that the Democrats have held for 139 years, and the polls did not say this was gonna happen. Democrats think theyíre in the process turning Texas blue, and yet this one seat that theyíve held in a district that went heavily for Hillary elected a Republican.Theyíre sitting there blind as a bad. They have no concept, they have no sense, because theyíre not connected to the American people. They have no idea how their behavior here is revving up Republicans to vote in November like nothing else could! You wait. Weíll see. Hereís David ìRodhamî Gergen last night on Anderson Cooper 210. Cooper said, ìThis call from Democrats for an FBI investigation. Itís a delay tactic, some people say.îGERGEN: This vital last step about whoís going to investigate is crucial to the outcome. Whatís most important for the country here, Anderson, is when this is all said and done, if Judge Kavanaughís going on the Supreme Court and itís gonna tip the balance of the court for years to come, uh, itís really essential that he go forward without a big cloud over him. To have Judge Kavanaugh go up there and join Clarence Thomas, youíre going to have two people who have been accused of sexual harassment on the court deciding whether Roe v. Wade should be sustained or not ó precedent ought to rule ó that is not a helpful situation.RUSH: Bingo! What did I tell you? Youíll ìhave two people on the court with the cloud of sexual harassment allegations hanging over themî? Why do those clouds exist? Because incredible, uncredible accusers came forth at the last minute to try to taint them. Neither Clarence Thomas nor Brett Kavanaugh were known as sexual anythings until the last days of their confirmation hearings. Folks, Iím telling you. I have suchÖ I have lost all respect for any of these people on the left.It takes a lot of effort, really, to rein in the loathing I have for these people and what they are willing to do. Decent peopleÖ I said this Monday. Decent people do not know how to deal with this. Decent people do not focus on how to literally destroy the lives of people they disagree with, and thatís what weíre facing. The left is literally trying with great effort to destroy the lives and the careers and the reputations of anybody they donít agree with.How can anybody respect these people? And they do it without any concern whatsoever. And all the while we have to sit here and listen to this drivel that theyíre the ones with all the big hearts and theyíre the ones with all the compassion, theyíre the ones with caring, theyíre the ones that are social justice warriors concerned about discrimination and unfairness! And they wantonly, eagerly, happily seek to personally destroy anybody who gets in their way!I mean ruin them!Wipe them out financially!Destroy their families!Ruin their reputations!Destroy their careers!Decent people donít know how to deal with that. Decent people are just gonna avoid it. Thatís why Trump was elected, and thatís why people that support Trump donít care one whit what he says in a twit or a tweet. They donít care one whit what he tweets. He is the lone person fighting back against any of this. Heís the only person that people that voted for him think has a chance of standing up to these people and stopping them. Thatís why they supported him, thatís why they elected him, and thatís why they donít abandon him now.††† "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/19/the-kavanaugh-accusation-is-a-set-up/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 19, 2018RUSH: All right. It is obvious to me, but I guess not a whole lot of people can say it. But this is a setup. Itís a thorough, entire setup. Itís gotta be a setup, and the Senate ought to deal with it as though itís a setup. If she doesnít show up, then go ahead with the vote ó and now the accuser is saying she canít show up, she wonít show up until the FBI investigates. Ladies and gentlemen, the whole business of the FBI investigating something thatís 36 years old is dubious at best.
But beyond that, accusers donít get to set the date of investigations. Accusers donít get to set the terms of the investigation ó unless they happen to be Hillary Clinton. I mean, Hillary Clinton was able to tell Comey when she would and wouldnít sit for an interview from which she was gonna be exonerated anyway in her whole email situation. But, I mean, this isÖ Itís abundantly obvious whatís going on here. Let me ask you a question. Let me put it to you this way.What would happen, letís say ó I donít know ó in the last 10 years up to last week if any woman had walked into any FBI office in the country and said the following: ìHi. Iím here to report that I was abused 35 years ago. I was ó I was ó I was at a party. Uh, I was 15, a little bit to drink, and a 17-year-old guy pushed me down on top of a table and laid on top of me. And then ó and then and then I think ó I think ó a friend came in and did something and anyway they left and I was left locked in the room. And I want to you to investigate.îDo you think if somebody shows up at an FBI office with that story, if they show up in person with that story, that the FBI is gonna give it any time whatsoever? The agents are gonna look at each other with kind of wary eyes and theyíre gonna crack silent jokes to one another. Iím not kidding. You take this out of the realm of a letter to a crazed, partisan United States senator, Dianne Feinstein, and just move this into the victim walking into an FBI office, ìIt was 35 years, 34 years. Iím not sure where. But I know that when I was 15, I was at a party, and some guy jumped on top of me.îSo letís say the FBI agent decides to actually take this further and in a very respectful way says, ìWell, Miss, were you raped or injured?îìUh, no, not really.îìDid you report this or tell anyone at the time, 36, 35 years ago?îìUh, no.îìWhat year was this, again, that this happened?îìUhhh, Iím not ó Iím not sure. I think it was 1982.îìWhere did this happen?îìI donít know! I donít know. I was so traumatized; I donít remember any of it. I just remember some guy jumping on me and I was drunk and ó and I donít know. But I want you to investigate it.îìOkay. Maíam, were there any witnesses?îìJust the one friend of his that pushed him off, and then they left before he could do anything.îWhat would the FBI do with this, if that scenario happened in one of their field offices? I will tell you what they would do: Zip, zero, nada. And the reason for bringing it up this way is to try to shine some kind of a different light on this and try to put this kind of allegation in some kind of context. The president is handling this in a quite fascinating way. Heís saying, ìI hope she shows up. I want to hear what she has to say. I really hope she shows up. Iím very interested in what she has to say. We all are. And if she shows up and if sheís credible, why, then weíre gonna have to do something about that.îMeaning he might have to turn Kavanaugh loose! So Trumpís out there allowing for the possibility that the woman is telling the truth and has a credible story that would be believable. And that if it is, then he might have no choice but than to jettison Kavanaugh and look for somebody else. Now, what do you think Trumpís doing there, Dawn? (interruption) You look disappointed. Youíre notÖ? (interruption) What do you think Trumpís doing? Well, see, this woman is saying sheís not showing up until the FBI investigates.Thereís nothing for any investigative agency to investigate! This is never gonna be anything more than ìhe said, she said.î Thatís all itís ever gonna be. The FBI canít investigate. She doesnít even remember where was it was. She doesnít even remember to tell íem where to go! She doesnít even remember for sure what year it was! She doesnít even remember how many people might have been in the room. How in the world is anybody gonna investigate this?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: There is a development here in the Kavanaugh-Blasey story, and thatís, as you knowÖ What are we gonna call her, the accuser? Is that what? The accuser first started out saying a horrible thing that happened, couldnít remember where, not sure the year, not sure the house and so forth, canít corroborate anything. Kavanaugh can produce 200 people testifying to his character. Three or four people that were named that donít even remember the event happening.This woman canít produce any witnesses.Kavanaughís got a bunch.So the Senate said, ìOkay. Well, you know what? Weíll delay our vote to Monday. Weíll even delay it beyond that. Weíll schedule a hearing on Monday where the accuser can come in and Kavanaugh can come in and their lawyers can query each other in the Senate. The Senator on the committee will get into the act.î The accuser said (stammering), ìAh, ah, ah, ah, Iím notÖ I ó I ó I ó Iím not coming.î She didnít respond to the invitation to show up.The people said, ìWell, if she doesnít show up after having been invited, then letís go ahead and schedule the vote and do it tomorrow.î This prompted the accuser to say (paraphrased), ìWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! No, I donít think Iím coming until the FBI investigators. No.î I donít care who you are, no accuser gets to determine the scope and the parameters of an investigation. The accuser doesnít get to determine when and who investigates. In no circumstance in the country does that happen.Nowhere!The accuser doesnít get to set the details of this. But thatís what sheís doing, she and her lawyer. So now the FBIís gotta be brought into this. They donít want to investigate. Thereís nothing to investigate! He doesnít remember where, when, why. She doesnít remember what year. She doesnít remember who was there. Thereís nothing for people 36 years after the fact to investigate, beyond what is already happening.Itís always gonna come down to, he said, she said. Then the president got into a deal and said (summarized), ìWe really hope she shows up. We I really want to hear is what she has to say. I want to find out if she is credible. I really hope she accepts the invitation to the Senate and shows up on Monday ó and, if sheís incredible, why, then weíre gonna have to perhaps jettison Judge Kavanaugh; pick somebody else.îHer lawyers say, ìNope. Weíre not showing up Monday. Weíre not showing up ever until the FBI investigates this.î Itís so obviously is a setup. So here is the latest development. Are you ready for this? Dadelut dadelut dadelut dadelut dadelut. Senator GrassleyÖ This is according to CNN. CNN has an anonymous source claiming that Senator Grassley is now willing to go to California to interview the accuser.Now, does that mean the entire Senate Judiciary Committee would join Senator Grassley on the Senate charter flight to interview her where she is most comfortable? Would she accept this or would she continue to say, ìIím not doing anything until the FBI investigatesî? Because it is so obvious that this is a setup. She doesnít want to answer questions and I donít think ever will. That isnít the point of this.The point of this is to delay this nomination because they really think theyíre gonna win the Senate. There are polls out there that say the Senate is now in play. I think thatís one of the reasons Feinstein released this, one of the reasons she held this. Nobody knew. I will guarantee you. Well, I canít guarantee you, but my (sigh) intelligence guided by experience, I donít think very many people believe this babe, and I donít even think thatís the point.Now, donít tell a lot of people Iím saying this ícause itíll get me in big trouble. But I donít think too many people really believe her. Thatís not the point. The option she provides is delay, delay, delay, delay. All her lawyer has to keep saying is, ìIím not Iím not bringing my client forward until the FBI investigates.î If the FBI investigates, sheíll say, ìI think the CIA should take a look at it now!î Whatever other thing they can come up with to delay, they will.Sheís not gonna show up and answer questions, and I think thatís what the president knows. When the president says, ìI really hope she accepts the invitation. I really hope she shows up. I really want to hear what she has to say ó and if sheís credible, ëBye-bye, Brett.'î Well, you know Trump doesnít want to jettison Kavanaugh ó and donít say this too loudly, but itís obvious some people on our side are trying to goad the babe into showing up.But I donít want to say that to too many people. I could give it away. We want to continue to play the psychological game here. But I donít think anybody believes her. I donít think FeinsteinÖ Feinstein even let the cat out of the bag that she canít confirm that all of this is truthful. And then she had do damage control and walk that back. Did you hear about that? Oh. Grab audio sound bite No. 7. This is from yesterday on Capitol Hill. She really blew it on this and immediately had to start walking this back and doing damage control.FEINSTEIN: This is a woman ó and I really believe ó whoís been profoundly impacted by this. Now, I canít say everything everythingís truthful; I donít know.RUSH: Oh! Oh! ìI canít say everythingís truthful.î Man, you have not seen an 80-year-old woman do a 180 faster than Dianne Feinstein did yesterday except maybe Ruth ìBuzziî Ginsburg and her famous workout now that CNN televised. Man, oh, man, did that send ripples of panic through the left when Dianne Feinstein said, ìI canít say everythingís truthful.î They donít believe her, I donít think. If they did, theyíd have brought this up.This would have been long-ago used. But in the #MeToo movement you simply canít say, ìYou know What? I donít believe you lady. I just donít.î Nobody in politics can say that. We on the radio can say it all day long. But they canít, obviously. So now, now Grassley has offered to go out to California. Do you think Chuck Grassley really wants to go to California, really wants to interview this babe to find out what she says? Theyíre giving her every opportunity.Theyíre going so far out of their way to be cooperative. Can you think of any other Senate witness where the committee chairman has offered to go to them in circumstances and settings that are amenable to whoever is being queried, interrogated, or interviewed? Ha! If this is true, sheíll find a way to turn this down. ìIíve left my home, and I canít I canít accept this invitation. Iím getting death threats. Iím feeling very scared! Iím feeling very frightened.ìIím feeling very, very unsafe, and so, Senator Grassley, thank you, but I canít even tell you where I am, in order to do the interview.î And the media will say, ìThen it must have been true. You know what, the shrinks say, Rush. The shrinks say that the less you can remember about an event, the more likely it is to have happened because youíre traumatized.î Well, if thatís the case, Kavanaugh doesnít remember any of it.He must be really traumatized ícause he doesnít remember a shred of this. She remembers enough to bollix up the United States Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation process. So Grassleyís offered to go interview her. I donít know if itís just Grassley and his staff or if heís gonna take the whole committee. Is Maxine Waters gonna be invited to go along? I have no idea. Itís just CNN with the story. But this woman does not want to answer questions. I think theyíre making it clear theyíre bending over backgrounds to let her know they want to hear her story.ìWeíll even come to you. We will bring the nationís capital to you, Dr. Ford,î and I know what sheís gonna say. (stammering) ìI canít ó I canít ó That ó thatÖ My ó my ó my ó my ó my ó my location would be compromised. Iíve had to leave. Iíve had to leave my home, Iíve had to leave my family, Iíve had to leave my heart because I am under death threat. And, Senator Grassley, I donít trust or anybody in the committee not to leak where I am to these deranged Trump voters that support you.îBREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Well, it seems like itís kind of official now. There will not be an FBI investigation of the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford. President Trump has said, ìNo, no FBI,î and the GOP, of course, said, ìNo FBI,î and if Trump says no FBI there isnít any, unless FBI wants to embarrass Trump. Who knows! The FBI probably isnít gonna look at it, which is then throwing the ball back in the accuserís court along with her lawyers because theyíre saying, ìWeíre not gonna go forward without an FBI investigation.îI donít thinkÖ As I said, I donít think the accuser wants to testify. I can believe that the accuser is nonplussed by all this. Actually, you know, Iím not even sure I believe that. I think weíre dealing with a hardened left-wing activist here, and I think theyíre all loaded for bear. I think theyíre prepared to do whatever. But this is obviously a stall technique. So now what will they do, if the request for an FBI investigation is being denied, then the accuser says, ìWell, then Iím ó Iím ó Iím not gonna come forwardî?The latest is that GrassleyÖ Supposedly, now, Grassley has offered to go out to California to interview her, which she can easily reject by saying, ìNo. Senator Grassley? Heís just trying to find out where I am! Iíve had to leave my home. I donít feel safe. Iím under death threats and other threats and Iíve had to go into hiding with my family and itís a horrible thing. And Iím not gonna tell people where I am just to go through this.îAt some point, at some point here Senator Grassley, the president, the Republicans are gonna have to decide to reschedule that vote ó and I wish it were still happening tomorrow. We know the Democrats are gonna oppose, and we know theyíre gonna oppose in unison. Weíre talking about the Judiciary Committee vote here, not the full vote of the Senate. Thatís what was scheduled to happen tomorrow.And if this woman refuses to testify, you canít let this woman or any other accuser who refuses to come forward and answer questions about her allegation ó you canít allow anybody like that ó to shut down the, quote, unquote, government, right? We canít have government shutdowns, and this is shutting down the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. Which is exactly the objective and the idea. So we will continue to discuss this as the program unfolds.Thereís no question here that this is a hit job. Itís a political hit job. If it looks, walks, and quacks like a duck, itís a duck. And this is a political hit job. And if I was lying, and if I was engaged in character assassination, I wouldnít be in a hurry to testify about it before the entire world because I would realize I donít have to do that in order to destroy somebody. All Iíve gotta do is make the allegation and a whole political party will back me up.All I have to do is make an allegation about the guy and a whole political party ó an entire political party and most of the United States media ó will back me up and I donít ever need to testify. I just have to keep making demands that that entire political party support and the media will support. Demands I know will never be met, like the FBI investigating this. And I will succeed in destroying the character and reputationÖ Well, sheís not gonna destroy the character, but sheís going to destroy the reputation and the career.Sheís trying to do that, as is the entire Democrat Party. So now the ball is eventually gonna be back in the Senateís hands. And theyíre gonna have to decide if they are going to retain any shred of dignity and proceed with their own process rather than have it hijacked here by somebody who wonít even answer questions about it. I donít care who you are, the accuser never sets terms of an interview or an investigation. The accuser doesnít get to tell investigators who investigates.The accuser doesnít get to say when the investigation or any aspect of it happens. The accuser doesnít get to do or have control over any of these things like this accuser is demanding, and itís because everybodyís afraid of the #MeToo movement. Everybodyís afraid of the womenís vote. Another named witness at the alleged Kavanaugh party denies being there. ìPatrick J. Smyth, one of the men who was allegedly at the party where Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s doesnít even remember the party and therefore denies the allegations of misconduct against Kavanaugh.ìSmythe and another man, Mark Judge ó who was actually named by Dr. Ford ó have both denied being at the party and have declined to come forward to the Judiciary Committee.î She has no witnesses. She just has a bunch of left-wing activitists demanding that everybody must believe her. ìFormer Classmate of Kavanaughís Denies Being at the Party and Sexual Assault Allegation.î This is just another story on Patrick Smyth, who denies being there.Lindsey Graham, Senator Lindsey Grahamnesty, in a statement to the Washington Post, likened the way Democrats have handled this allegation to a drive-by shooting. ìSenator Graham said, ëThis is a drive-by shooting. All I can say is weíre bringing this to a close. Theyíve had tons of time to do this. This has been a drive-by shooting when it comes to Kavanaugh. Iíll to listen the lady, but weíre gonna bring this to a close.'îìDrive-byî has a ring to it, doesnít it?Drive-By Media.Drive-By Democrat Party.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Well, hereís another bit of thrown water thrown on the accuser. The FBI will not be investigating her claim, and now Montgomery County police say that unless a complaint is filed, they will not pursue an investigation into Christine Blasey Fordís allegation that Brett Kavanaugh physically and sexually assaulted her at a party in Montgomery County in the early 1980s. Both were in high school. Montgomery County, at a local constabulary. They wonít investigate unless a complaint is filed.Well, that stands to reason, and there hasnít been a complaint filed. And what do you think the odds are that she will file a complaint? You think her lawyers will run down to courthouse and file a complaint or call the cops and file a complaint? I donít know if you can do it after 30 years. Statute of limitations, statue of limitations, those of you in Rio Linda. I donít know. But she didnít file a complaint. She didnít even remember to tell anybody about this until six years ago.†  "

Thereís a new phenomenon happening in American journalism. When I say new, itís new to Donald Trump. Trump will tweet something. Trump will say something either at a rally or in the Oval Office. When the AP, Reuters, New York Times, Washington Post report it, they all say, ìPresident Trump, without evidence,î said whatever he said. ìPresident Trump said, without evidenceÖî This is meant to cast doubt and aspersions on what Trump is saying, to make readers believe Trump is lying.Well, why isnít this part of the story? ìChristine Blasey Ford, without evidence, says that Judge Kavanaugh did whatever she says he did back when they were a couple of drunkards in high school.î Youíll notice itís very selective. ìDonald Trump, without evidence, claimed,î blah, blah, blah.

But we do not see, Christine Blasey Ford, without evidenceÖNo, it says the exact opposite. Christine Blasey Ford and whatever she says you must believe it. You must believe it.

Now, many times, depending on juries and so forth, thatís what defense lawyers seek to do, find an alternative explanation.But itís the governmentís job ó the prosecutors, the accusers ó to prove. But how does she get an exemption? How does Christine Blasey Ford get an exemption from having to prove her claim? Well, because sheís Democrat and a leftist and thatís just the way the world works for us. We donít have to prove anything. Weíre liberals, and the way we do and think is the natural order of things and you just better accept it or else. We donít have to prove anything, especially to you, conservative skunks! Screw you! Thatís their attitude.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/18/will-kavanaughs-accuser-show-up-at-the-hearing/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 18, 2018RUSH: Okay. So after all this, Christine Blasey Ford is not gonna show up for the hearing? She hasnít accepted the invitation to show up for the hearing ó and yet they moved it? They rescheduled. It was supposed to be Thursday, the vote. They canceled the vote, they moved the vote ó well, they delayed it ó so that they could have this hearing with Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh, and she hadnít even accepted the invitation to show up, and now her lawyer is saying itís not her job to corroborate her story?Sheís not the one that has to corroborate her story? (summarized) ìNo, no, no, no! Sheís making the allegation. So she doesnít have to corroborate anything. It needs to be investigated.î This is no different than Harry Reid saying, ìI have a friend that told me that Mitt Romney hasnít paid his taxes in 10 years,î and the media says to Harry Reid, ìWhatís your evidence?î And Harry Reid says, ìDonít ask me! You need to go talk to Romney. Romneyís the guy hadnít paid his taxes in 10 years.îAnd the media said, ìOh, yeah! Okay.î So they all ran off and start badgering Romney about why he hadnít paid his taxes in 10 years. This is exactly what this is! So the woman ó who doesnít say a word about this for Brett Kavanaughís entire professional career at various confirmation hearings for the D.C. Circuit court of appeals for everything else that heís done working in the Bush White House. This woman hasnít had a word to say, not a thing to say.And then after every Democrat effort to exhaust ó or theyíve exhausted every effort to keep him off the Supreme Court, this thing shows up with Dianne Feinstein saying, ìOh, look what I just remembered I have here. You know, I got this in July, and I just now remembered it.î And now everybodyís saying, ìOh, my God. Oh, jeez. Look what Kavanaugh did!î And theyíre just accepting it because, once again, it is not the nature of the evidence; itís the seriousness of the charge. And I am not making this up.This lawyer who, by the wayÖ Katz is her name. She is a Democrat activist. She is plainly saying itís not her job to corroborate her story. Her efforts, her legal efforts are funded by George Soros. There is no doubt what this is. Weíve been here before. How in the world can you say that the accuser doesnít have to corroborate anything? ìDebra Katz, the attorney for the woman accusing Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, said that it is not her clientís job to corroborate her claims.ìKatz said on CNN on Monday that investigators should be responsible for proving Christine Blasey Fordís claim that Kavanaugh held her down and drunkenly groped her while at a party in high school.î So she can make this claim. She doesnít have to prove it. She doesnít have to have any evidence. The investigators have to track it down and prove it. But now the Democrats are saying, ìWait a minute. We shouldnít be investigating this.î Like Kamala Harris, Kamala Harris said, ìWe shouldnít be investigating this. The FBI should.îYou know, this woman, Kamala HarrisÖ These people are so dense. Does she not know the FBI does not investigate these kinds of crimes? The FBI does not investigate local crimes, high school drunken party crimes. The FBI doesnít investigate those. But then again thatís not what this is about. This is about delaying everything so Kavanaugh does not get on the court and the Republicans are playing right along with this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The vote was scheduled to happen regardless what happened with Kavanaugh. But the Kavanaugh story is to obscuring everything else that for the big spenders? I mean, this is a godsend. Theyíre able to go in and vote on this stuff body even paying attention or cares, and once itís over, thereís tiny little reporting on it, precious little. But I wanted to pass that on to you nevertheless because there are some things continue to happen, like Trump is declassified some of the FISA documents.That doesnít mean theyíre gonna be made public right away. Declassifying doesnít necessarily mean theyíre gonna do made public. At some point, they will. So weíre tracking that as well. But just a few sound bites here to wrap up our exclusive coverage of the Kavanaugh smear. Last night on the Fox News ChannelÖ You know, 65 women whoíve known Kavanaugh signed a letter claiming that heís prince of a guy, perfectly fine, decent person.This allegation is something they cannot possibly imagine. That 65 has now swelled to 200 women whoíve signed that letter. I donít know how many of you guys out there know 200 women period ó especially if youíre married ó and all of a sudden 200 women pop up and say they know you well enough to vouch for your character? (chuckles) Just 200 women period vouching for you! Who can say this? (interruption) No, no! I believe it! Donít misunderstand! I believe everything. I believe Kavanaugh. I do not believe the woman.Iím just saying this is astounding, and theyíre claiming they donít have to corroborate whatever it is theyíre charging? Weíve got all of these people who personally know Kavanaugh saying it canít possibly true. They have no experience with him. Two of them appeared on Fox News last night. Letís see. One of the questionsÖ There names are (letís see) Maura Cain and Maura Fitzgerald, I believe, here, and Maura Fitzgerald is first. Question: ìOne of the questions is gonna be whether or not he was somebody who drank heavily in high school who could have potentially blacked out during this experience and yet had committed this act but doesnít remember it. Maura Fitzgerald, is that a possibility?îFITZGERALD: No. In all of the times, all the years that Iíve known Brett, even if we had a beer, he was always in complete control. And he was actually one of the guys that if we were at a social gathering, heíd been the guy to look out for other people. He was always in control.RUSH: ìAlways in control.î So he was a designated driver-type guy. Here is Maura Cain being asked if she ever saw Kavanaugh drunk, falling down sloppy all over himself.CAIN: We drank beer. It was legal. I never saw him out-of-control drunk. He always retained his composure. He was a responsible guy. He was someone who did have a beer, but he was never out of control. He never became someone different after drinking.RUSH: Well, two people. ìNever out of control.î You know people like that, donít you? I do. I have. In high school, I was kind of impressed by the 15- or 16-year-old who was already plotting his entire life and guarding his reputation even then. I mean, a lot of people donít start taking this stuff seriously ítil they get to college or afterwards. He may have been one of these people. Who was taking seriously his life and the establishment of a reputation because he knew what he wanted to do. It could be this is his general personality. So the next question, ìYou both dated him. Most people do date several people going through high school and college. Maura Fitzgerald, was he ever physically aggressive to you? What was he like as a boyfriend?îFITZGERALD: He was nothing about kind and polite and respectful. Iíve known him since high school. I dated him briefly in college and weíve remained close friends ever since. I cherish his friendship. He has just been such a stand-up guy, full of integrity. I admire him. He never exhibited to me or anyone else that I know ó treated no one with disrespect.RUSH: So in this sordid, tale we have a woman who doesnít remember where it happened or maybe even who ó not sure of the year ó sends a letter to Dianne Feinstein saying (paraphrased), ìI donít want to go public! I donít want anybody to know who I am. I donít want you pursuing this. But I think I remember this guy falling all over me,î blah, blah, blah, blah. When this surfaces and the Democrats have run out of options, this surfacesÖ I donít know. Is there anybody coming forward with knowledge of this woman and vouching for her? I donít know. Iím asking. Has anybody seen this?ìWell, uh, no, Rush. She doesnít want to come forward.îBy the way, the Republican Senate caucus is meeting as we speak to decide what to do if the woman does not accept the invitation to show up to the circus on Monday. Theyíre deciding what to do. Theyíve gotta be real careful here. Theyíve gotta give her a timeline to accept. They gotta tell her, you know, ìBy sundown tomorrow you gotta tell us if youíre coming or not ícause if youíre not weíre gonna do the vote.î They canít just let her keep the issue open. The United States Senate doesnít, or shouldnít, be manipulated this way.Itís up to senators to make sure that it isnít. Anyway, weíve got all kinds of people vouching for Kavanaugh. It seems effortless. It seems people canít wait to come out and speak up and vouch for the guy. So now we move on to the Drive-By Media. Up next is A.B. Stoddard. She was on the Special Report with Bret Baier show last night. She was on the All-Star Panel, and Bret Baier said, ìOkay, the accuser here is a registered Democrat. Sheís donated to political causes and progressive candidates. A.B., this does not mean this is strictly motivated by politics. The accusations are one thing. How it was dealt with is another.îSTODDARD: The idea that, uh, some left-wing grassroots (scoffs) some m-motivated person would ruin their life over this (stammers) to try to take the Kavanaugh nomination down is crazy. The reporting backs up what her lawyer said, that she didnít intend to come forward and was outed.RUSH: (chuckles) Okay. ìSo the idea that some left-wing grassroots motivated person would ruin their life over this to try to take the Kavanaugh nomination outís crazy.î No, A.B., itís not. It is, in fact par, for the course. It is, in fact, what left-wing activists do! Her life will not be ruined. She will become an instant hero to the left, whether she succeeds in taking Kavanaugh off the court or not. Take a look Anita Hill! She was hired at the provost of this university and then at that university and sheís constantly asked to speak.She is considered an expert on sexual harassment now. There have been books written about her virtue. There have been movies made about her virtue. Even to this day, Anita Hill is celebrated by the left for her valiant effort to destroy Clarence Thomas. This woman would not suffer any indignities. But the idea that left-wing activists would not do this? This is exactly what left-wing activists do! Weíre witnessing it! The idea that a left-wing activist wouldnít do this while a left-wing activist is doing it is comical.ìNo, that person is not speeding,î as they go by you at a hundred miles an hour.ìThe idea that a left-wing activist would try to take down Kavanaugh like this is crazy,î while weíre watching it happen. (chuckles) So weíre not only not supposed to believe what we see, we are supposed to believe what we canít prove, but we are to deny what we see. Itís an amazing set of standards. Up next, F. Chuck Todd who was on the Today show today. The cohost, Hoda Kotb, said, ìTell us about the Kavanaugh nomination. Is it in trouble?îTODD: I definitely think itís in trouble. Nothing would surprise me including himÖ By the end of the week if Judge Kavanaugh decides he doesnít want to go through this, it isnít worth it, he doesnít want to. Maybe he can win, but he doesnít want an asterisk. I mean, it wouldnít surprise me if he chose to withdraw and chose to back down. I think a lot, frankly, will have to do with what more do we learn this week? Is there anybody else from their high school days that come (sic) out? I think if any little thing that we donít know now comes out before that hearing on Monday, I donít think the hearing happens.RUSH: So while the accuser has yet to accept the invitation to show up Monday and appear at a circus hearing or whatever, F. Chuck Todd is asking somebody else to come forward! Itís a little dog whistle here, folks. When F. Chuck Todd says, ì[I]t wouldnít surprise me if he chose to withdrawÖ I think a lot, frankly, will have to do with what more do we learn this week? Is there anybody else from their high school days that come[s] out?îIn other words, F. Chuck Todd is saying, ìWeíre waiting. Weíre willing to help you! Is there any other woman in high school that this guy, Kavanaugh, bullied in similar fashion? Weíre waiting for you.î Some might even say that that is a signal that somebody else is gonna show up, that F. Chuck wouldnít put that out there unless he knew somebody was gonna come out. I donít know about that. I maybe donít know, but I wouldnít be surprised if theyíre asking, because thatís what they do. Let me tell you right now: The media is hoping that the woman has an assist, that another woman comes forward from some other period in Kavanaughís life.What would your reaction be if that happened? You gotta be on the lookout for it, folks. Now that F. Chuck has waved a little red flag up there, the message gone out, ìWe can get this guy to quit if thereís another one of you. Is there anybody out there? Is there is anybody out there, anybody else from their high school days to come out.î Savannah Guthrie then asked form of the question, ìLook, just the specter of a public hearing, Chuck. Weíve seen this before. Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas a generation ago. What a high-wire act for both parties.îTODD: This one is actually in an election year! I remember that. I ó I was here in Washington for that, and that was an election year. It was the beginning of a presidential campaign. And it seemed to divide not just this town, but this country. This one ó because weíre so close to an election, because of the Donald Trump era ó this one feels like a tinderbox. It feels like four sticks of dynamite wrapped in radioactive material. (snickers) It just feels like either side could see this erupt a culture war that defines the rest of the midterm election, the next six weeks in a way that could totally scramble what, uh, the outcomes could be.RUSH: Well, so F. Chuck signals what heís hoping for out there, what heís expecting. They want a nuclear explosion out of all this. Theyíre not satisfied yet. Kavanaugh hasnít withdrawn, which is what this is all about.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/17/what-frosts-me-about-this-kavanaugh-mess/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 17, 2018RUSH: I checked the email during the break. ìYou donít sound mad about this.î (Snort!) My friends, I spent the first part of hour telling you how mad I was back in 1990 when George Bush appointed Clarence Thomas. Look, I donít want to be too redundant here. I realize people are in and out all day long. But back when the Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill stuff happened, remember, this program ó and donít misunderstand me here. This is not ego speaking. Iím trying to give you the factual, historical lay of the land. This program was it.There were some other conservative talk show that had come up on radio, but Fox News had not started yet. The blogosphere was not anywhere near what it was gonna be. This was 1990! People were still using CompuServe for crying out loud or AOL. CNN is the only cable network with the three networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) and the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times. It was a full-court press to do exactly whatís being done to Kavanaugh right now: Destroy Clarence Thomas. And, believe me, I was absorbed.I did nothing but refute everything the Democrats were saying every day of those confirmation hearings. Notice none of this that weíre hearing about could have an has happened during any of it testimony, any of the confirmation. This woman did not come forward then. They dragged Anita Hill out of wherever she was. It was Paul Simonís wife and Howard Metzenbaum. They got together and they yanked her out. They had to talk her into doing it. Everybody denies that today ícause they want to make it look like she was this committed activist back in 1990.They had to drag her out and they had to coach her and prepare her for testimony and so forth. But at least she testified, and Clarence Thomas got a chance to react to it with the famous ìhigh-tech lynchingî speech that he gave that put everybody in the Senate on this committee in their place. This is happening after all the testimony. Iím livid about this. Iím livid that decent people donít seem to have any kind of option dealing with this. You canítÖ Just in the essence of decency, you wonít find any more decent human being today than Brett Kavanaugh or his family.They are a threat to nobody. They havenít threatened anybody. Theyíve not destroyed anybody. The left could not defeat Kavanaugh during the constitutionally enumerated period of time to do so, and that would be the confirmation hearings. They struck out, they bombed out, and so now theyíre dredging this up from the abject sewer. Of course Iím livid about it! Iím somewhat a little frustrated by the fact that it works. This stuff, in a sane world, the American people would be rising up in indignation and outrage over what Dianne Feinstein is attempting to pull here.I think they did when they elected Trump, by the way. How come the Access Hollywood video didnít destroy Trump? How come none of those usual Democrat attempts to destroy Trump destroyed him? He still won. He got elected. But this is it, this is their playbook. They go back to it over and over and over again, and their playbook involves destroying people. It has me so mad, I canít see straight. But just coming here and acting mad isnít gonna get anything done because it is actually happening. So I find it despicable.Iím outraged that more people in Washington donít. To people in Washington, this is the game! In the news business, man, this is exciting! This is ratings today. Never mind the fact that a man and his family returned the guillotine and subject to being destroyed simply because he has achieved enough in his life that heís qualified to be on the U.S. Supreme Court. In Washington today, that means itís open season to try and destroy the guy. Now, you might say, ìWell, he knew that, Rush. They know.îSure everybody knows it. Does that make it right? There isnít any indignation. In fact, if you go to a lot of places in conservative media and youíll find people making sure that weíre not unfair to the accuser and that weíre open-minded and that we really understand that she can be telling the truth. ìAnd itís a horrible thing if she is, and we must get to the bottom of it. ButÖî And then they go on with what they really think. But they feel it necessary to make sure nobody gets the wrong idea, that they think Kavanaugh should be sent packing if any of this is true.If any of this is true. Theyíre asking us to believe one heck of a lot for this to be true. And if this woman wants to come testify, itís got to happen now. The Republicans run this show, and they need to make this happen pronto.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Letís grab audio sound bite No. 8. This is Chuck-You Schumer. He was on The View today speaking with Maude Behar, and theyíre having a discussion about Kavanaugh and what to do about all this.SCHUMER: I believe Professor Ford. I think sheís credible, and I think when the investigation is finished and when she testifies and Judge Kavanaugh testifies, I think a majority of senators will find her credible, and I donít thinkÖ I never thought Kavanaugh should get ó get appointed because he was picked by a president who said, ìIím only gonna pick someone who repeals Roe v. Wadeî (sic) and vetted by a group whose mission was that. The president said, ìIím only gonna pick someone who repeals health care,î (sic) and he was vetted by another group, the Heritage Foundation.MAUDE: Uh-huh.SCHUMER: So I said he shouldnít be on the bench before this, but now we got get to the bottom of this.RUSH: Now, Trump never said (laughing) that heís gonna pick people that are only anti-Roe v. Wade. Itís the exact opposite! There never was gonna be a litmus test. These people just lie left and right through their teeth about this. Hereís Schumer saying, ìI think sheíll be credible, butÖ butÖî You hear Schumer, ìWhatever this guy believes, we canít tolerate this!î You lost, Senator! You donít get to pick the nominee in this circumstance! You lost! Hillary lost, and you donít run the Senate, and you donít get to pick the nominee!Now, they exhausted everything they had in trying to destroy Kavanaugh, and they didnít have anything. They cannot question his qualifications. They cannot question his readiness. They cannot question his fitness. They did everything they could. They tried to bully Susan Collins into abandoning her support for him ó and when all else failed, they go to the bottom of the deck and get this. They get it, for all intents and purposes, on the eve of the Judiciary Committee vote, which is Thursday.Iíll tell you as a personal aside, something that frosts me about this is what the hell have they been waiting so long to do this vote in the first place for? Why wasnít this vote two weeks ago? ìUh, Mr. Limbaugh, the Senate runs at a very slow and distribute pace.î Yes, yes I understand that. But, for crying out loud, donít you realize itís time to heíd these people off at the pass? ìBut Mr. Limbaugh, Mr. Limbaugh, no matter when they had scheduled the vote, this would have happened.î Fine. Schedule the vote anyway. The fact that we hadnít taken the vote provided the window of an opportunity here for all of this to occur anyway.Up next is Vince in parts unknown of central Florida. Welcome, sir. Great to have you here.CALLER: Thank you. First-time caller, sir. Thank you.RUSH: You bet.CALLER: I just got a question. Do you think there will ever be another president after Trump?RUSH: Do I think there will ever be another president after Trump?CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: (chuckling)CALLER: What heís going through. Itís just amazing.RUSH: Oh, of course there will be. Of course there will be. Youíre echoing óCALLER: (laughing)RUSH: Thatís what Michael Mooreís out there saying.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: Michael Moore is out there saying that Donald Trump is the last president. There will not be another one. Not for the reason you just were saying.CALLER: Yeah. Itís horrible what heís going through. You had started the program this morning about asking what we can do with this media and the liberal Democrats, what we can do. The only thing I can think of we might have to march our own marches. Take it to the streets. Let us get some exposure, because right now the Republicans are not getting any exposure out there. Itís always the media. They got the sports.They got a lot of arrows in their quiver, see? The Republicans are simply are not getting mobilized. And I think they need to go mobile. And I think they really need to do like back in the sixties with the civil rights movement. Get it out there. Get buses. Mobile! Take it out of those rallies. Those rales are nice and thereís a lot of passion but I think all that passion should really be on the road where the media will have to report on it. Theyíre getting shut out, you see, by those rallies.RUSH: See, this óCALLER: They donít even show those rallies on CNN and all those media outlets. But when theyíre on the road, when theyíre on the road and in the streets, then they canít stop not óRUSH: This is my point, though. Thatís not what decent people do. Decent people donít raise hell. They donít destroy property, start marching in the streets and causing all kinds of violence and stuff. Thatís not what decent people do! Decent people have other things to do. Theyíve got other more productive, sensible things to do. Thatís my whole point. Decent people do not sit around all day figuring out how to destroy people. Decent people donít sit around all day trying to fi how to advance an agenda no matter who gets hurt at what cost.But they certainly donít sit around and strategize moving forward a political agenda that requires people to be hurt, damaged, and destroyed. The left does! Thatís their modus operandi day in and day out. Iím not saying there arenít ways; donít misunderstand. Iím just telling you that decent people who are up against this donít know what to do. They donít think this way! You tell decent people, ìYouíve got to get out there and start blowing up some buildings! Youíve got to get out there and start breaking some glass! Youíve got to get out there and start breaking some heads!îThatís not what theyíre about.Itís not what they do.ìBut, Rush! But, Rush! Decent people fight wars.îThatís a great point. Decent people resisted Hitler and the Germans. Decent people resisted the Japanese in World War II, the Nazis, the fascists and so forth. How do they did it? It required going to battle, it required going to war, and I donít know how many people on our side are willing to do it. Obviously many arenít. Theyíre expecting people they elect to do it at the point of attack, which happens to be Washington. They donít see it happening much there, either, except with President Trump in the game. But heís often alone in his efforts.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Hereís David in Houston. Youíre next, sir. Great to have you with us. Hi.CALLER: (silence) Hello?RUSH: Hello.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: Yeah!CALLER: Is this Rush?RUSH: This is.CALLER: Ah. Fantastic. Well, I have an answer to your question of why DiFi sat on this surprise, this October Surprise until now. The answer is midterms. This is all about the midterms. Because if she can bring this out at the last minute and throw the midterms to the Democrats, they solve all their problems, they get rid of Kavanaugh. Trump canít appoint another Supreme Court nominee, and they take the House back, and they impeach Trump. The whole thing, itís all geared towards the midterms. Thatís the answer.RUSH: I think thatís true. But you think thatís more important than killing Kavanaugh?CALLER: Well, thatís just a bonus. (interruption) They can get both. They can use this nomination. Because if Republicans push Kavanaugh as a damaged candidate by this accusation, then they can use that against the Republicans in the midterms to swing, you know, women voters, #MeToo type people ó which, #MeToo would vote for Democrats anyway óRUSH: See, thatís the kind of thingÖ Youíre right about that, but thatís what frosts me. It literally frosts me. You canít find a guy women love and respect more than this guy. So here comes this the bogus charge out of nowhere at the last minute and if the Republicans stick by Kavanaugh ó which is the right thing to do! If they stick by him, then this supposedly is gonna energize women all over America to vote against Republicans because they supposedly are standing in solidarity with an alleged rapist! This is what frosts me, and it wouldnít work if voters werenít so ignorant and dumb ó and for that we have the media to thank.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: See, thatís the thing. If the Republicans stick with Kavanaugh, the Democrats get to say, ìSee? Republicans donít care about women. War on Women,î blah, blah, blah, blah. When in fact, Kavanaugh could not be more impeccably respectful and decent to women.  "

Yeah, I guess so. And Iíve started reading Rush Revere with my 8-year-old daughter, and she loves it.

Anyway óRUSH: Well, thank you. God bless you, sir. I appreciate that.CALLER: Yeah. Anyway, first point I wanted to make is I actually think these accusations are kind of good news because it shows the Democrats are out of ideas. Theyíve gotta go back to the old Anita Hill accusations toÖ It seems to me if they canít come up with anything new, thatís actually good for our side.RUSH: Well, theoretically. But in the process, you have two Republicans that have peeled off and the nomination may have gone with íem! So the Democrats havenít lost anything here. If that actually happensÖ I know you have another point thatís interesting too.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Peter in Redding, Connecticut. You actuallyÖ You think this has to do with Mitt Romney? How does this have to do with Mitt Romney?CALLER: Okay. Well, I was reading a theory on the internet, and I wanted to get your opinion on it. But itís saying the timing of this 2012, you know, psychiatrist meeting is kind of interesting because going be back to 2012 was the reelection. Romney was widely expected to be the Republican nominee. According to a March 2012 article by Jeffrey Toobin in the New Yorker, Kavanaugh was widely expected to be Romneyís Supreme Court pick.At the time, they were very concerned about the Affordable Care Act. Kavanaugh had voted against it on the D.C. Circuit court of appeals, and you really donít get more establishment Republican than Kavanaugh. So, you know, this theory is that really they were concerned about Ginsburg, whether, you know, that she wouldnít retire and they were afraid she might die in office. So, you know, so basically the theory is that this is really a preemptive attack in case Obama didnít win in 2012.RUSH: Uhhh, but she didnít come forward in 2012.CALLER: She didnít come forward but she was getting it on the record in 2012.RUSH: Oh, you mean at the psychiatristís office.CALLER: Right.RUSH: At the therapistís office, getting it on the record. So you think they were gonna take Kavanaugh out back then if Romney had won and nominated him?CALLER: Right. Yeah. If Romney had won and then Ginsburg for some reasonÖ She was struggling with cancer and if Ginsburg some reason dies in office and if Romney had won and nominated Kavanaugh to Supreme Court óRUSH: There are a lot of ifs here, and the problem is they almost didnít bring it up now. I mean, if theyíve had itÖ I get the theory that theyíve had it in the deck since 2012, and if Romney had beaten Obama and Ruth ìBuzziî Ginsburg had had something unfortunate happen, that they were gonna try to destroy Kavanaugh. The purpose here was to get her story on record with a shrink, a psychiatrist, a therapist, or what have you, for use if Romney had been elected. Okay, fine. But they didnít bring this forward until they had exhausted every other attempt to destroy Kavanaugh.And if theyíd been worried about Kavanaugh all those years ó and I donít doubt that they have. I mean, he is who he is and heís the kind of judge that he is. I think they have doubts and qualms about the womanís story, and I think one of the reasons DiFi sat on it is I donít think they want to put this woman up in public. I really donít. I think theyíre gonna try to engineer her testifying in private, behind closed doors because of the trauma and her desire to remain private. I appreciate the call, Peter.  "

I just wanted to comment that I think itís time to examine Dianne Feinsteinís motivation and her involvement in this entire accusation.

Taking down, or being part of taking down a SCOTUS nominee would certainly put her in that limelight with California liberals.The #MeToo allegations have removed all complicity on the part of women and the female accusers, so that any such allegation, even if itís not against a SCOTUS nominee, gets automatically promoted to headline status and really takes precedent over rule of law and common decency. I think that Feinsteinís motivation here is personal, trying to save her own political life, her own political lifetime career in Washington. Iíd appreciate your comment.RUSH: Now, whoís her opponent in California? She beat back Kevin de Leon, right?CALLER: Well, yes. She beat him byÖ She got 2.9 million votes. However, she has been rebuked by her own party earlier this year.RUSH: Yeah, but thatís California. Theyíre not gonna elect a Republican to run against her or a RepublicanÖ Theyíre not óCALLER: Certainly not, but I do believe that it would be within the graces of her own political establishment, her own backyard is necessary for any liberal politician in California.RUSH: Well, look. I donít dispute that, that there is a personal benefit to her in California with local politicians, because she had a fairly bitter primary fight against Kevin. His name is Kevin de Leon, but he had it changed to Kevin de Leon to sound, you know, more worldly out there. And he got close, and she was ripped to shreds during the Democrat Party convention out in California, but she prevailed and sheís gonna have her six-year term.I think this is what it is. I think if thereís that benefit to her, itís secondary. I think itís the primary reason sheís doing this. It may be equal. It may be a twofer for her. But, every bit as much of this is about derailing a Trump nominee, keeping a conservative jurist off the Supreme Court because they think theyíre gonna win the Senate!You cannot erase that, folks. They think that the Senate is theirs. They think the House is theirs. Theyíre believing all the pre-election polls. They are of the belief that none of what theyíre doing here is causing any kind of a backlash among Republican voters, Trump supporters. They think that theyíre beating back everybody here. Theyíre gonna win this in a landslide. Theyíre gonna win the House in a landslide, theyíre gonna win the Senate, and, if that happens, theyíre gonna get rid of Trump in six months or render him impotent, and this is what theyíre looking at.And so if thatís the case, why let Trump have this nominee? Why in the world let Trump stack the court? This would make the court 5-4 conservative and heís not a moderate, heís replacing Kennedy, who was. This guy, Kavanaugh, is Scalia. Heís Gorsuch. My only point is, folks, that the Democrats, in order to do this, Dianne Feinstein, in order to do this, they have to personally destroy. Theyíve lost the ability to defeat him. They could not stop him in the confirmation battle.They could not stop him at the Senate Judiciary Committee. They could not stop him with witnesses. So now theyíre out to destroy him, and destroy his family and destroy his life, and destroy his career, and destroy his future. And even if he survives this and is on the court, they will continue to destroy him with books and movies and all that.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/14/kavanaugh-story-takes-despicable-turn/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 14, 2018RUSH: Now, the Kavanaugh circumstance has taken an absolutely despicable turn. Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer of the New Yorker and Clarence Thomas fame are now claiming that this story is attempted rape, that Judge Kavanaugh, Brett Kavanaugh attempted to rape the girl when they were both 17 back in high school. This is the girl supposedly locked in the room that didnít want any of this to come out.Ronan Farrowís tweet: A woman alleged to two Democrats that during high school Brett Kavanaugh held her down and attempted to force himself on her, placing a hand over her mouth and turning up music to conceal her protests. How the politicians responded is now a controversy. So you put Ronan Farrowís name in there, you know, heís got instant credibility on this. Weinstein, Leslie Moonves.So, back in a moment.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. So now this has gone from being Anita Hill redux to Roy Moore redux. Anita Hill came forward and claimed that Clarence Thomas sexually harassed her ó while she followed him to every job and career change he made ó and the evidence was a pubic hair on a Coke can. Clarence Thomas had had enough of it at some point and gave a great speech on the whole idea of a high-tech lynching. I heard it again yesterday.Iíd forgotten how powerful it was when he was speaking to the entire committee about this whole Anita Hill coming out of nowhere at the very end on the verge of confirmation. Well, now the same thing has happened with Kavanaugh. Theyíve gone to every length possible to stop his confirmation, hounding Susan Collins. In fact, they were even bribing her. They were telling her that they were going to ó and they did, actually ó start raising like a million dollars for an opponent to run against her if she did not promise to vote against Kavanaugh.She would not give them that. So they have ratcheted up the harassment, including sending her a massive cardboard cutout of male genitalia. All she has said is that she doesnít like the tactics of these people that oppose Judge Kavanaugh. She doesnít like the tactics. Now with Kavanaugh himself, it was originally that he had locked a young girl in a room at age 17 in high school, and she eventually got out. Now Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer have entered the scene claiming that this was attempted rape.Now, if this is true, why wouldnít this girl have come forward sometime before now? Kavanaugh has been in the news I donít know how many times in recent years. He has undergone similar congressional hearings, confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee for his previous posts. He has worked in the Bush administration. Heís been involved in government lawyering for many, many years. Why now? Why all of a sudden now, when every effort to stop him seems to have been exhausted?Weíre told that Dianne Feinstein had this letter for months and sheís been sitting on it, that whoever sent it to her asked her to not do anything with it, which is really odd when you think about it. Why send the letter to a United States senator if youíre then gonna ask, ìDonít do anything with this and keep my name out of itî? Why send it? When I heard that yesterday, itís like so much of what goes on: It doesnít make any sense. If you donít want to be caught up in this, then donít send that letter!You obviously want to be caught up in it if youíre gonna send a United States senator a letter. You donít detail what happened, and then Dianne Feinstein finally decides to release it, turns it over to the FBI. The FBI says, ìWeíre not gonna investigate this.î Well, that was yesterday. But whoever this is out in California could have come forward many times before now because Kavanaughís been in the news many times before, including his previous appointments to the court.Heís been reported to be on Trumpís short list since before Trump was elected. Trump put together a list of people he would nominate to the Supreme Court, and it was a very important factor in him getting elected, by the way. Thatís why he is judiciously following that list because it was. It was one of the stabilizing aspects of Trump. It was one of the things that helped people stabilize their view of Trump. That list of Supreme Court nominees was fabulous.He has stuck to it, and it mitigated against charges that Trump was a loose cannon and undependable and didnít know right from wrong, didnít know conservative from liberal and all. But the point is Kavanaughís name has been out there publicly every day for three years minimum now. Why wouldnít this have been mentioned before? And if the charge was this serious ó if itís attempted rape ó why didnít Feinstein give it to the FBI back in July?And if itís true, why hasnít Kavanaugh told anybody about this as a warning? And why didnít Feinstein tell other Judiciary Committee members about this? Why did she hold this close to the vest and not say anything to anybody? And why didnít she asked Kavanaugh about it when they met in private or even when she questioned him in public? Letís go to some audio sound bites. Letís see. Nah. This is Trumpís tweets over the hurricane and Puerto Rico. Theyíre not letting that go.They think theyíve got Trump now on this hurricane in Puerto Rico and theyíre gonna nail him. Letís see. I tell you what letís do. Grab sound bites 2 and 3 and 4 to start with ó and 5. Yeah. Hereís Clarence Thomas, sunset weíre on the subject. Letís go back. He was on C-SPAN on Wednesday night. They aired a Federalist Society event that was recorded Saturday in Fort Worth. Justice Thomas spoke, and here is a portion of what he saidÖTHOMAS: I was asking a friend this week, ìWhat happened to the word ëhonorí?î Think about it. How many peep can you use ó in leadership positions today ó the word that I used: ìhonorableî? ìHonorable.î Not ìthe honorable.î ìHonorable.î If we could use that word about more people who are in public life ó people who actually ask the questions at confirmation hearings instead of Spartacus. (chuckling)AUDIENCE: (laughter)RUSH: A little dig there at Cory Booker, and what heís saying makes sense. Where is the honor? Where is the respect for whatís going on? Weíre talking about here a judicial nominee to the United States Supreme Court. Where is the honor in simply dealing with the occasion? Itís United States Supreme Court.Itís the Supreme Court. Itís the law of the land. Where is the treatment of this with any honor and dignity at all? There hasnít been any! The dignity is long gone. The honor is nowhere to be found. Itís just nothing but despicable, extremist and radical left-wing politics destroying whatever they have to destroy along the way to getting what they want. Same appearance, next bite, Justice Thomas.THOMAS: If we could use the word ìhonorableî more often, think about the difference it will make. Then youíll have a legacy. We will have left the country in better shape morally, structurally, than we found it. But as long as weíre looking at our interests or scoring points or looking cute or being on TV? If you canít debate hard issues honestly with honor, with integrity, how do we keep a civil society?RUSH: Well, itís a good question. How many of you would suggest that we have a civil society now? You remember the mayor of Baltimore, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, she made a big point out of giving protesters space to destroy. We had to acknowledge their rage, acknowledge their anger, and if they wanted to go someplace and do a protest, gotta give íem space. If they got destroy something to get it out of their system, let íem do it.Is there a civil society on college campi today? This Puerto Rican thing, do you know that some group of people Puerto Rican or Latino protesters ó I donít have the name right in front of me ó are having a massive protest on September 22nd, next Saturday, at Mar-a-Lago. And of course these people, protesting, thatís wonderful about America. Dissent is how America came to be. You must honor dissent.Not your kind. Your dissent is designed to destroy, not build up. Anyway, itís a great point. Here is Justice Thomas. Weíre gonna go back and just listen to a little bit of the high-tech lynching remarks that he made. Itís October 11th, 1991, on Capitol Hill during the confirmation hearings. This is after the Anita Hill thing had been brought to light. It was the wife of Senator Paul Simon, by the way, for those of you who werenít live in í91 or old enough to pay attention.Thomas was sailing along, the left was fit to be tied because they considered this to be their seat. Thurgood Marshall, first African-American Supreme Court justice had passed away. George H. W. Bush nominates Clarence Thomas, and they went berserk because that was their seat, they said. That seat belongs to a Jesse Jackson type, not Clarence Thomas. And they raised holy hell.And they were not able to stop Thomas until at the very end they had persuaded this babe Anita Hill to come forward and claim that Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her and it was the wife of Illinois Senator Paul Simon who led that process of going to her, talking to her, and getting her to do it.There was some other California babe named Susan Hoerchner. She testified looking constantly constipated. Iíve never forgotten it. I had a great impression of Judge Hoerchner. She was an administrative law judge, basically a shrink judge. But it was a circus. And hereís Justice Thomas as a nominee testifying about all this.THOMAS: This is a circus. Itís a national disgrace. It is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves. And it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, you will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the U.S. Senate rather than hung from a tree.RUSH: Right. He went to talk about how it was Kafkaesque. Ruth Bader Ginsburg Wednesday night, Washington, George Washington University School of Law. She spoke and she did a Q&A. And this was part of what she said.GINSBURG: Justice Scalia, who was certainly a known character, he had been a law professor and written many things, he had been on the DC Circuit, and the vote was unanimous. Thatís the way it should be, instead of what itís become, which is a highly partisan show.RUSH: There you have it. Itís true. She got confirmed 88 to nothing or 88 to 2, whatever. Justice Scalia, 98 to 2. It was overwhelming. We havenít seen those days since Robert Bork.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Tolland, Connecticut. Chris, great to have you. Iím glad you waited, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hey, Rush. Thanks for spreading the truth.RUSH: I try. Thank you very much for recognizing it.CALLER: I just wanted to mention, like when your other callers was saying the outrage about why Congress, Senate, uses taxpayer money to hide things, but Iím just wondering where all the outrage is against Keith Ellison but yet they want to say something about Kavanaugh.RUSH: Keith Ellisonís one of their guys. Theyíre not gonna help take down one of their own guys. They couldnít save Weinstein! They couldnít save Moonves! But they can save the chairman of the Democrat National Committee. Plus, you know, he checks a lot of boxes. Heís African-Americans, African-American, African-American, African-American. Heís African-American. (interruption) Muslim? Is he Muslim? Thatís a big box to check. Heís African-American. Male. I think male could be demerit; so there might be, you know, cis nonbinary, cis nonbinary, African-American.Theyíre not gonna willingly take out ó theyíre gonna see if people will ignore that too. Look, you raise a good point, donít misunderstand, Iím playing devilís advocate with you. Donít expect them to take their own people out. And notice that Democrat voters donít even care! If they even hear about it. I donít think the Democrats or the media, they didnít widely broadcast the sexual peccadillos and oddities of Keith Ellison anyway. Chris, I appreciate the call.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/13/feinstein-tries-to-metoo-kavanaugh/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 13, 2018RUSH: We have more breaking news, ladies and gentlemen. Dianne FeinsteinÖ This is despicable. It is obvious that the efforts they have made to bribe Susan Collins into voting against Brett Kavanaugh have failed. You know what that is? Thereís a bunch of leftists that have been threatening Susan Collins. These questions set up a collection campaign, GoFundMe or something like that for one of her opponents in Maine to the tune of maybe a million dollars to run against her if she votes for Kavanaugh.If she doesnít vote for Kavanaugh, then they withdraw. This is bribery, pure and simple, and sheís resisting it, and sheís being openly critical of the tactics of people on the left. News from Dianne Feinstein. Feinsteinís statement on Kavanaugh: ìI have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities.îMan, are they grasping at straws now. What do you think this is? What is it? Some anonymous person that doesnít want to take it anywhere has gotten hold of Feinstein despite the fact this anonymous person wants to stay anonymous and doesnít want to come forward or press the matter. Despite all that, DiFi says sheís honoring that decision but has referred the matter to federal investigative authorities. How is that not pressing the matter further? So what do you think this is? Want to take a stab at it? What is she referring to?What could possibly be so earth shattering so late in the game, when Grassley has scheduled the vote for Kavanaugh or is close to? I tell you what I think. I think itís a #MeToo thing. I think Dianne Feinsteinís trying to say that a woman has come forward and has evidence that Kavanaugh mistreated her. What else could it be? Ah, I guess it could be any number of things. But thatís the first thing that comes to mind.And if it is that ó if itís something that got Weinstein, if itís something that got Leslie Moonves and now this guy at CBS, Jeff Fager ó well, thereís no way this could be investigated before the vote. So itíd be a cloud hanging over Kavanaugh. This investigation that sheís referred it to. Thereís no investigation that can happen before the vote; so got this giant cloud now hanging over Kavanaugh at the time of the vote placed there by a desperate Democrat Party and Dianne Feinstein, who had a spy from China on her staff for 20 years!Nobody cares; nobody seems to think itís a problem.Itís a hail Mary because they have apparently failed in their efforts to intimidate and bribe Susan Collins.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Without knowing what it is that this late comer has told Dianne Feinstein, stop and think of something. This is almost like Clarence Thomas. Near the end of his confirmation hearings, all of a sudden here came Anita Hill. This guy, Kavanaugh, they have turned his life inside out and upside down for how many months now, and at the last moment somebody nobody found, somebody nobody had any idea existed has tiptoed forward to anonymously tell Dianne Feinstein? I wonder if this somebody in the Trump administration or maybe a journalist pretending to be whatever this is.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I was right. This is it. This is the Anita Hill playbook. This is a rehash of Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas at the last moment on the eve of the vote for Brett Kavanaugh. Headline for a story at TheHill.com: ìSenate Democrats Sending Secret Letter About Kavanaugh to the FBI ó Sources told The Intercept that the letter was relayed to lawmakers by an individual affiliated with Stanford University. Some sources told the publication that it was about an incident involving Kavanaugh and a woman while they were in high school. Attorney Debra Katz is believed to be representing the woman who is the subject of the letter.îI guess we shouldnít be surprised. Itís an attempt to get in on the #MeToo movement. The #MeToo movement has ended up destroying too many Democrat guys. Moonves is now gone, Jeff Fager at 60 Minutes is now gone, Weinstein, of course, is gone. Thereís a whole slew of íem, of liberal Democrat men who are literal pigs when it comes to treating women. I guess theyíve gotta find a way here to stop Kavanaugh. They tried bribing Susan Collins into voting against him. Sheís resisted those efforts.So now Dianne Feinstein, she has this statement. If youíre just joining us, she issued a statement, quote, ìI have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further. I have honored that decision.îNo, you havenít. You sent the letter to the FBI. ìI have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities,î which would be the FBI. And TheHill.com, attorney Debra Katz believed to be representing the woman who is the subject of the letter, and sources told The Intercept that the letter was relayed to lawmakers by an individual that was affiliated with Stanford. Some sources told the publication it was an incident involving Kavanaugh and a woman while they were in high school.I think itís strange the guyís had his life thoroughly examined for how many months now, certainly weeks? And they come up with nothing. In fact, when it comes to women, there are liberal women who have said heís a genius, heíd be great on the court. There are women who have worked with him throughout his career who have done nothing but say the most amazingly positive things in recommending him.But they found somebody from high school ó oh, no! No! I take that back. They didnít find anybody. They were minding their own business and somebody affiliated with Stanford University decided to say, ìYou know what? They didnít get rid of the guy. I gotta stop him.î And so out of the blue, Dianne Feinstein gets this letter. It is despicable.Now I tell you what I expect to happen. A bunch of people on our side of the aisle, rather than rejecting this out of hand and characterize it for what it is, are gonna start wringing their hands and get all worried, ìOh, no,î and start talking about how an investigation canít take place before the vote. ìOh, no, what do we do?î And then some voices, maybe Trump should withdraw the nom. Donít be surprised if you hear this. Maybe Trump should withdraw.We canít be tainted by this. I canít tell you how many times that this has happened where people on our side donít even question the premise, donít even challenge the premise, just accept it, try to limit the damage so that it doesnít affect them.I just got a statement from Grassley on this. ìSenator Grassley is aware of Senator Feinsteinís referral. At this time he has not seen the letter in question and is respecting the request for confidentiality. No plan to change the committeeís consideration of Judge Kavanaughís nomination.îSo according to Grassley, the vote will continue to go, it will happen on the 20th, which is a week from today, for those of you in Rio Linda. But of course thatís subject to change. Grassley, ìI havenít seen it, but Iíll be glad to respect the confidentiality here.îBREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Don in Chicago, great to have you on the EIB Network. Hi.CALLER: Hello, Rush.RUSH: Hey. Whatís happening?CALLER: First-time caller, and Iíve been listening since about a month after Barack Obama took over as president.RUSH: Well, thank you. Iím glad youíre out there, sir.CALLER: Good. Just an observation. I think the purpose of this Dianne Feinstein issue is not only to delay the Kavanaugh hearings, but regardless of how the Republicans react, the Democrats will have it to use as a campaign issue.RUSH: Oh, obviously. You mean a campaign issue above and beyond the Kavanaugh hearings?CALLER: Exactly. On it or regardless of how the Republicans ó if the Republicans hold off, theyíll say, well, theyíve gotta hold off and the Republicans donít want to hold off. If they go ahead with it theyíll say the Republicans went ahead and everybody knew that there was an issue here.RUSH: You know what? Thereís no stopping it now. Theyíve pulled the trigger on this. So we have to follow this through and find a way to deal with it. You know, the Access Hollywood video didnít work with Trump. These people keep going back to the same pages in their playbook. Iím telling you, this is Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill redux.Itís almost identical. This is happening a little later than they found Anita Hill and trotted her forward, but itís the same premise except this woman is in high school, or the incident supposedly was in high school. Sheís now at Stanford. The reason they tell you that is so they can find her. You know, she wants anonymity. Supposedly. Dianne Feinstein said, ìIím gonna respect the anonymity, Iím gonna respect the fact she doesnít want to investigate it, but Iím gonna investigate it anyway.îI guarantee you right now, everybody in the Drive-Bys are going through yearbooks, okay, high school, Stanford, sheís there now; so who went to high school with Kavanaugh, whoís at Stanford now? Theyíll come out with a database of people, theyíll start narrowing it down. And it is to provide a cloud over the vote. I think they may have a dream that this would suspend the vote, delay the vote, itís a serious allegation.Weíre back here ó the Mueller investigation is this. Clarence Thomas, there was never any evidence other than a pubic hair on a Coke can. That was it. And that couldnít be proved. So what we have here is not the nature of the evidence, once again the Democrats are trotting out the seriousness of the charge mandates that we investigate even though there isnít any evidence, the seriousness of the charge, and thatís what Mueller is relying on too.

The headline: ìKanye Is Not Alone: Blacks Are Deserting the Democrat Party ó In the middle of the Kavanaugh madness a fascinating development passed relatively under the radar Thursday. Trumpís approval ratings among black voters hit 35% in the Rasmussen Report survey. This day last year, it was 23%.îSo in one year, Trumpís approval rate among African-Americans has jumped from 23% to 35%. No matter how you feel about polls, a 12-point jump in a year is significant. ëCause Iím telling you, folks, and you know this. Every presidential election, 90%, 88, 92% of the black vote goes Democrat. If that number ever became 70%, the Democrat Party would be up the tepee. They would be in deep doo-doo, and they know it, and everybody else knows it.Now, this 12-point increase, this is especially true and surprising considering the constant drumbeat from the press that Trump is a racist pig. Somebodyís not buying it, and itís not just Kanye West. If this number grows just a little bit, the Democrat Party is, as I say, in deep tepee. And there is a story here, Celebrity Insider, Jay-Z and Beyonce Z are completely done with Kim Kardashians and Kanye West after Kanyeís latest antics.Kanye is scheduled to have lunch with Trump in the Oval Orifice tomorrow. Somebody told me, ìIf that happened, itíd be a big mistake. Trump need not have lunch with some celebrity after this hurricaneís hit. Donít do it. Cancel it.î I said, ìNo. Take Kanye with you, if you go down there and view the disaster area. Put Kanye on the jet and go down there and survey it. Thatís how you have lunch with him.

This is in TheHill.com, and itís a column by somebody named Brent Budowsky, who sounds like the captain of a bowling team.Snerdley said he thinks this guy was a legislative aide to who? (interruption) You thinkÖ? (interruption) This guy worked for the Lord Bentsen, the former senator in Texas. ìI knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine, and you, Quayle, youíre no Jack Kennedy.î That Lord Bentsen, right? (interruption) Okay. Well, whether he did or not, he still writes pieces for TheHill.com.ìBudowsky: Code Red Alert to Democrats.î What? I thought the Democrats were smokiní. I thought the Democrats are gonna win everything! Like TheHill.com had a story yesterday that made it look like 209 seats are gonna convert to the Democrat Party. ìFormer first lady Michelle Obama, one of the most popular and respected public figures in America, should spend a day taping personal endorsements for Democratic candidates for the House and Senate ÖìThis column is a code red alertÖî Iím reading from it, by the way. ìThis column is a code red alert to Democrats and a call to arms for the most popular and respected Democrats in America, such as Michelle [My Belle] Obama, to lead the charge for all hands on deck at a critical moment for America and democracy. In my view,î writes Budowsky, ìthereís a 25% chance that Democrats end the midterms with a nightmare scenario.îWhat?A 25% chance of a nightmare?Well, I thought you guys had it all locked up! I thought you pretty much had the House already done. Pelosiís already talking about being speaker. You guys are already planning to impeach and investigate Kavanaugh and then Trump or vice versa. Now ìthereís a 25% chance that Democrats end the midterms with a nightmare scenarioî? Thatís not quite the same as a 93% chance Hillary wins the presidency at 5 p.m. on election night. Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.Why are these people panicking?Mr. Budowsky says, ìThis is not a moment for complacency or easy talk of blue waves. It is a moment for bold and maximum action and turnout based on a powerful and urgent sense of opportunity and danger.î He says, ìIt is even possible Democrats win the House by a significant number of seats. However, it is also possible that the Democrats gain only 20 seats, falling short of winning control.ìThat would leave House Republicans dominant with a smaller but even more right-wing majority as the leading losers in the House midterms are comparatively moderate GOP House members. Ö Democrats could lose one or two Senate seats, continuing a Republican Senate that is even further to the right and even more partisan than the GOP majority today.îBudowsky says, ìIf this nightmare scenario for Democrats and America unfolds on Election Day, a vindictive and triumphant Trump ó having won a victory for the politics of hatred, fear andÖî (laughing) Donít you love this? You people on the left donít understand unity when you see it. You donít understand love when you see it. You do not understand confidence when you see it. You see love; you see hatred. You see excitement; you think you see fear.RUSH: When you see thousands and thousands and thousands trying to get into Trump rallies, you somehow see division. ì[A] vindictive and triumphant Trump Ö will stand alongside Republican leaders of the new Republican Congress feeling he has achieved an unstoppable dominance over his party, our country and every branch of government with all checks and balances destroyed.îìThis code red alert,î writes Budowsky, ìwarns about the danger of so much unchecked power concentrated in the hands of a president who tried to criminalize his opponentÖî (laughing) What? Who did what? Who tried to criminalize who? Is this guy serious? Trump tried to criminalizeÖ? Hillary did engage in criminal activities. Not only with her email server, but in working with the Russians and creating a phony dossier thatÖOh, and by the way, there is now, thanks to John SolomonÖ Folks, weíve been talking for the longest time about how the Clinton campaign paid Steele to write the dossier that was then used by the FBI to go get a FISA warrant. John Solomon has now confirmed that that happened. There is no doubt, and itís been confirmed in unclassified testimony by a lawyer from the FBI named James Baker.This is no more a matter of speculation. It actually did happen. Well, we didnít need it confirmed. We already knew it. But itís now been smack-dab officially confirmed that the Clinton administration conceived and commissioned the writing of that dossier that everybody knew was fake and phony, and they used the law firm Perkins Coie as a cutout to pay for it to make the money spent on this look like legal campaign expenses.And then that dossier was taken to the FBI and used by the FBI to get a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign. We now know, itís incontrovertibly proved ó even though Mueller is ignoring it ó that the FBI tried to sabotage the Trump campaign and then tried to run a little soft, silent coup to get Trump out of office after he was elected and inaugurated. And this guy Budowsky has the audacity to say Trump ìtried to criminalize his opponent in the last electionî?Donald Trump is the victim of criminality and always has been and continues to be. Now, this is a great illustration of the divide. Thereís nothing in common with this. This is such a perverted, disjointed, absent-any-kind-of-reality view of things that it is impossible to find any common ground. There isnít any overlap. Weíre dealing with an unhinged group of people who have lost the ability to reason and donít care to even.But the point of this is theyíre scared. Theyíre worried. They donít really believe this blue wave business. Not thoroughly. Not if theyíre gonna write pieces like this where they admit thereís a 25 to 30% chance they could lose everything and then Trump would win everything, and of course if that happens then democracy has been flouted. The people voting their preferences is an example of democracy failing, to these people, when they lose.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Going back here to the bowling team captainís piece, Brent Budowsky. Did you notice who he saidÖ? If the Republicans hold on, if the Republicans hold onto the House and hold onto the Senate, did you hear him very frightfully point out how that would happen? It would happen because moderate Republicans would be losing and they would be replaced by conservative Republicans.In other words, if the Republicans hold, the Republicans who will win in these districts where Republicans are retiring, his theory is, (imitation) ìWe could get even more conservatism! We could get even more conservative House and a more conservative Senate!î Heís putting the moderate Republicans at greatest risk for losing in his theory, in his code red alert, warning Democrats the Republicans could win it.So heís saying that moderate Republicans are at the greater risk of losing their seats in the House. Now, how is that possible, given everything we are told by the Democrat Party and the Drive-By Media? They tell us America loves the moderates, America loves the centrists, America doesnít want any part of extremists! America wants no part whatsoever of radicals. And yet there is the entire Democrat Party which is nothing but radical now.My point is, again, do not fall for any of this hype that it is over and that the Republicans have no prayer and that thereís gonna be this gigantic blue wave, because not even the Democrats, in their private selves, when they talk to each other in private, not even they really believe it. They want you to think they do. They want you to be dispirited or depressed. They are very alarmed, in fact, that the latest polls that show the Kavanaugh effect on the Republican side is ginning up turnout.Itís ginning up interest, and theyíre really flummoxed and ticked off at a bunch of polling data. Thereís an NPR poll out there. Thereís a Fox News poll, a couple others that show suburban Republican women are saying in polling data that they have a renewed interest, an increased energy, an intense desire to go vote. This is not what was supposed to happen. Thatís why all these attacks lately in leftist media ripping into white conservative suburban women and do we need them or not?And we donít, they say. So this is notÖ As we sit here today, this is not developing as they want you to think it is. Back in 2016, do you remember any pieces before the presidential race anywhere in Democrat media warning people, ìHey, hey, you know what? Thereís a nightmare scenario here where Trump could win. You gotta dial it back. We gotta be very careful.î Do you remember any of that?There was none. They were so solid sure. They were definitely convinced that they were gonna win every. Hillary was gonna win in the biggest landslide. I mean, they had Trumpís chances at 3%, 7%, 10%. But nobody gave Trump a chance. In fact, some of the news even said Trump never thought he was gonna win! Trump never even wanted to win! Trump was the most surprised guy on Election Day in the world when he won.He didnít want to win; they were all depressed at Trump headquarters! Thatís what they wanted you to believe. Now theyíve started out saying the same thing as though power is a birthright that every American realizes the Democrats have to be put back in power. Every American releases the mistake of voting for Trump. Every Trump voter canít wait to apologize. Every Trump voter realizes, is embarrassed, wants to fix the mistake; canít wait to vote for the next Democrat on their ballot.Now all of a suddenÖ Itís not just Budowsky, by the way, either. There are others who are raising red flags out there that this might not be developing as they wish.  "

And this is more polling data from New York Magazine. ìPoll: Majority of Americans Say Kavanaugh Should Not Be on the Supreme Court.î New York Magazine.

Itís the same poll, by the way, thatÖ Well, now Iím confused, ícause the CNN poll shows that Kavanaughís popularity after having been confirmed is increasing. But they still say a majority of Americans say Kavanaugh should not be on the court, and The Hill, in promoting this article (this runs in New York Magazine, TheHill.com) a majority of Americans donít want Kavanaugh on their Supreme Court or Republicans in control of their Congress or Donald Trump in their White House.You see, Republicans are outliers, strangers, oddballs, kooks, really weird. Not even Americans, really. Not even part of this country. Theyíre interlopers and a majority of the American people donít want Republicans in charge of their country, their court, their Congress, or their White House. Hereís a pull quote: ìOf course, in a well-functioning democracy, any of these news cycles would have been terrible for the Republican Party. But in a well-functioning democracy, the Senate would have rejected Kavanaughís nomination:ìThe 50 senators who voted him onto the court last weekend collectively represent just 44% of the U.S. population.î So New York MagazineÖ I told you this Kavanaugh thing, this is just the beginning of what I donít think most people can even imagine is headed our way. Some of you I think do, but I think a lot of people have no idea the absolute tumult and chaos that weíre all headed for. Regardless the results of elections, I just think the left is out of control and has a mission that is designed to totally wipe out and erase any traces of the actual founding of this country, the principles and the reasons behind it.And, you know, if youíve been listening regularly, I have been dabbling at this in a focused manner for the past two to three weeks attempting to explain the depths here of my concern, and what I think is actually happening and what needs to happen to beat it back and how difficult that is going to be.

I print them out, and Iíve got a couple of them here I want to give you some excerpts from and share with you because theyíre very, very close to echoing my sentiments. But before getting into those, let me give you a couple of preludes. ìSpecial Ed TeacherÖî Itís a Washington Times headline. ìSpecial Ed Teacher on Paid Leave After Call to Kill Justice KavanaughîìA special education teacher in Minnesota may soon receive some ëspecialí attention by federal law enforcement officials after calling for the killing,î for the murder, ìof Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Intermediate School District 917 has placed Samantha Ness on paid administrative leave for a tweet, now deleted, which encouraged the assassination of the newest member of the U.S. Supreme Court. Samantha Ness tweeted: ëSo whoís [sic] gonna take one for the team and kill Kavanaugh?'îMs. Ness later followed up with a subsequent tweet, ìBrett Kavanaugh [sic] will be dealing with death threats for the rest of his life being on the Supreme Court. I doubt my mid-west [sic] ass is a real threat.î But bear in mind this womanís a teacher of special ed students. What if one of them decided to carry out her wishes? Now, she has deleted her Twitter account, but her tweet was captured and shared by a bunch of people who said they reported it to the FBI and the Secret Service.Now, for the record, itís the US Marshals Service that protects federal judges. But six of one, half dozen of another. ìGoogle Executive Slams the GOP Over the Kavanaugh Nomination: ë[F-BOMB]. YOU. ALL. TO. HELL.í ó A design leader at Google has slammed Republicans in an angry Twitter rant over the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh.î David Hogue is his name, not to be confused with Camera Hogg. ëîYou are finished, @GOP. You polished the final nail for your own coffins. [F-BOMB]. YOU. ALL. TO. HELL,í wrote Dave Hogue Saturday, in the now-deleted tweet.ìëI hope the last images burned into your slimy, evil, treasonous retinas are millions of women laughing and clapping and celebrating as your souls descend into the flames,í he added.î Folks, this is not idle ranting by the deranged. This is our opposition. This is the American left today. This is the result of two generations of college education, the campus and the corruption and the perversion there has become mainstreamed in American pop culture. Itís not on the fringes. This is my point.Itís not out there on the fringes and itís not something that you would say is not representative or descriptive of the mainstream of the American left. This is who they are. This is a design leader! This is some leading design executive at Google! During the hearings last week, one of Kavanaughís best friends showed up to sit behind him. He is a top-tier executive at Facebook. Facebook employees were outraged when they saw his face on TV sitting behind Kavanaugh at the Judiciary Committee hearing, and they have demanded that the guy be fired.Theyíve demanded that all kinds of thingsÖ Facebook employees. Facebook has caved, and the executive has apologized. Heís sorry for offending Facebook employees. This is not fringe. These are not outliers. These are people who make up the base, the foundation, the mainstream of the American left today, and particularly and importantly within pop culture. Google, Facebook, high-tier executives and ranking employees demanding Kafkaesque-like treatment for the people who show any allegiance to the enemy, any friendship with the enemy.Do not think this is gonna go away, and donít think itís a couple of extreme examples. This is who they are. Sarah Silverman, a well-known and oftentimes just filthy comedienne, said that she hopes President Donald Trump would one day be a victim of sexual assault, ëheld downí and ëviolatedí in a tweet Friday. ëI hope you someday understand what it is to be held down against your will and violated. Your compassion is startless,í [sic] Sarah Silverman tweeted at Trump.îIt was just 10 years ago that so-called comedienne Sandra Bernhard was threatening Sarah Palin that if she ever came to New York City she would be ìgang-raped by my big black brothers,î quote, unquote. Remember the outrage on that one from the Democrat Party? This tweet, by the way, from Sarah Silverman was in response to President Trump saying that unruly protesters in Washington, D.C. are ëpaid professionalsí.Trump tweeted: ìThe very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad.î Look, they may be paid, but that does not diminish what theyíre doing. They would be there anyway. The fact that theyíre being paid is insurance that they get there. But do not think that just because theyíre being paid, this rage and hatred is not real. I will grant that among some of these protesters bused in that thereís a lot of acting and theyíre reciting scripts that theyíve memorized.But folks, do not discount the prevalence of this as identifying characteristics of people on the left. Trump has characterized them as an angry mob. They have reacted as an angry mob. Christopher Coldwell writes for the Weekly Standard. And he has a piece that I came across in the process of show prep each and every day, and I mentioned a moment ago that Iíve run across some things that happen to coincidentallyÖSometimes I wonder, you know, ìHow did I run across these? Is it divine intervention?î because they help me formulate the things I wish to say you about this. And he has a piece here about the Kavanaugh aftermath, and here is the relevant part of it for me. ìThe general Democratic view that has hardened since the 1960s is the one expressed on many occasions by Barackî Hussein O. ìThe United States is notÖî By the way, this is very important! This is [Christopher] Caldwell. He names thisÖThis is a description of how the left sees America, and that view of America ìis the one expressed on many occasions by Barack Obama.î It is this. ìThe United States is not a country bound by a common history or a common ethnicity ó it is a set of values.î Now, think back to all the times you can hear ObamaÖ Remember Obama speaking about an event that had happened or something that he had planned in legislation?He was famous. (impression) ìThis is not our values. This is not who we are. And we must be better. These are not our values.î And every time he did it, well, his values are never mind, and Iím looking at what he was talking about. I canít remember specifics here, but just the idea that he would stand there and presume to be the arbiter and the person who defines American values while rejecting the premise of the very founding of America!How can in the world can this guyís values be said to be Americaís values when Obama and his Democrats reject the common principles found in the very origins of America? But this point is right on the money. That, as far as the left is concerned, we donít have anything in common. (summarized) ìWe donít have a common history. White people have a history and then the minorities all have another history, and thereís nothing in common.ìAnd the white people have been illegally running things for their benefit for 200-some-odd years and the minorities have been taking it on the chin. And itís about time that changed. Thatís what this upheaval and overthrow is all about.î Thereís nothing in common. Thereís noÖ The minorities of America sense no greatness in America.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Right. So hereís the thing, folks. According to Obama and the left, America is not a country bound by common history or anything of the sort. There is no common ethnicity; there is no common trace to our similarities. We have nothing in common at all. Instead, America is ìa set of valuesî ó a set of values ó and thatís all America is: A set of values the left defines to build a country around.But thereís a dark side to that. Rather than culture and society and commonality defining values, the left defines values based on their political perversions and corruption. And if thatís all a country is, a set of values, then somebody who does not share those values is not permitted to be a member of the community ó and thatís us, folks. Conservatives. We donít share their values. Their values define America. We are out.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let me just finish this business about the way America is according to the modern American left. This includes the Democrat Party and the media. There is a disdain for our founding. Thatís what we all think that we have in common. Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, founding documents, Declaration, Constitution. Not these people. America is flawed. America is illegitimate. It was not properly founded because it was founded only for a few people ó rich white men.This is whatís being taught. You can say itís crazy. You can say you donít believe it. This is what has been taught for two generations on the American college campus in the academe. Young, impressionable kids ó especially minorities ó are eating it up. They are swallowing it whole. They love it. It explains so many failures. It explains the injustices, the inequalities. It explains why capitalism sucks. Itís a built-in excuse for people who donít think they matter, who donít think theyíre ever gonna matter!They turn their lives over to Democrats to get even. Not to make their lives better, but to get even with all these people who have made their lives horrible! So you set up ìa set of values,î and thatís the basis on which the country is built. You get to define the values, and anybody that doesnít subscribe to íem is not welcome in the so-called nation or the community. If you donít share the values of the American left, then youíre not really a member of this national community.Youíre not deserving of its basic protections like presumption of innocence, because youíre flawed from the get-go. If you donít share the values of Christine Blasey Ford and the Senate Democrats on the committee, then you donít get any presumption of innocence. You donít get any benefit of the doubt. You donít deserve to be on the court because you represent a threat to their ìset of values.î Illegal immigrants? They belong! They are accepted members of the community, provisionally, because they share the same values.And what are those values? The values of discrimination. The values of insufficiency, inadequacy. The values of being mistreated, forgotten ó and the value of voting Democrat. Never forget that. But this explains what is, to many people, an inexplicable divide. Why would so many American leftists attach virtue to people in the country illegally, and talk about the separation of families and these kids, and have no concern ó no concern ó about the future of kids alive and born in America?Itís all based on this values basis on which they organize the country. So illegal immigrants ó children separated from their mommies by the Trump administration ó have much more in common with the American left, which has been discriminated in similar ways by the white majority since the days of the founding. Illegal immigrants are partners in the struggle! Illegal immigrants and criminals in general are partners in the struggle against this oppressive majority, which has denied fun and liberty and freedom to anybody but themselves.Look at Kavanaugh himself. The first way they went after Kavanaugh was sexual assault. There wasnít any evidence for that! There was no evidence; there was no corroboration. So then it became that he wouldnít be fair! He wouldnít be fair because of this whole experience, because of his anger, because of his extreme statements while he testified. It would prove that he was only interested in revenge ó and therefore, he became temperamentally unacceptable.And then it became amplified where his judicial temperament was just not permitted!ìHe doesnít have the values that we want on the Supreme Court.îSo he was accused of partisanship. He was accused of judicial intemperate. He was accused of sexual harassment. None of those things stuck. So it basically boils down to the fact that heís not one of them ó and when you get route down to it, thatís what was all about. The irony is that Kavanaugh was chosen because he is an establishment guy, and it was thought that he would sail through much easier than, say, an Amy Coney Barrett, who is demonstrably conservative, has written of her opposition to Roe v. Wade.Now, there is another piece that I encountered. Andy McCarthy pointed me to it. A member of the board at National Review has his own website, David Bahnsen. B-a-h-n-s-e-n. Heís written a very detailed essay describing his fears for the culture war that weíre in and where we are headed. And, like me, he thinks that this Kavanaugh thing represents nothing of the end. But rather this is just the beginning and is an indication of how much worse things are going to get. Let me just titillate you here.This is one of the first pull quotes I excerpted from Mr. Bahnsen: ìAt the heart of my statement that things will never be the same again [in America] is this discovery: The left does not wish to co-exist with the right in this country; they wish to extinguishî the right. Now, not news to me. But you gotta remember, Beltway types, the Never Trumper conservatives have always assumed that they are brethren with their fellow leftist intellectuals.Theyíve always thought that, even though theyíre conservative and the leftists are will you believe, that still theyíre both intellectuals, and they had that in common, and the leftist intellectuals would always accept the right-wing intellectual based on the commonality of intellectualism. Thatís what always has just frustrated me to no end about the Never-Trumpers. Theyíre blind as bats. Theyíre not even in the field, much less in the game.Even now, even with this Kavanaugh stuff, some of them are reluctant to get in the game. They still seek the approval of those who reject them. Theyíll go down the tubes with good manners. I still! I still run intoÖ Believe this. I still run into Republicans who tell me, ìIf the Republicans would just stop talking about abortion, we could win elections. If the Republicans would just stop talking about abortion, just get rid of abortionÖîI look at them with puzzlement like I cannot describe. ìYou really think thatís what all this is about?î ìYes! Weíve gotta stop talking about abortion.î I say, ìWhen did you stop paying attention to politics, 20 years ago?î ìWhat do you mean? Weíre so far beyond that. You donít even see it!î But at the heart of it is: ìIf we just change who we are, then theyíll stop being so mean,î and that is not true, and isnít the answer, and it is not the solution, because they have no desire to coexist.They are not energized by the intellectual feast of debate like our intellectuals are. They donít want any part of debating anything. Thereís nothing to debate! Weíre not legitimate to them! So they want to just wipe us out. We donít share their values; we never will. Thereís no reason to pay us any attention whatsoever. They do not value the so-called liberal order of society. What weíre living through right now is an unprecedented level of hate, dishonesty, distrust, and mistreatment.There is an amazingly strong disdain for the ideology of conservatism, but not just that. There is an unprecedented disdain and hatred of the social norms, ícause they donít fit in them. They know it. They donít fit in them! Theyíre out to change what is normal, and itís gonna be them and whatever they claim normal is. They want no part of constitutional government. Constitutional governmentís part of that which has discriminated against them from the get-go.They donít want any part of Western civilization.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/09/ho-nominates-ford-for-award/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 9, 2018RUSH: And here we go, folks. Right on cue, right on schedule, the headline: ìChristine Blasey Ford Nominated for Distinguished Alumna Award at Alma Mater.î Itís from TheHill.com. ìChristine Blasey Ford, the college professor who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assaultî with no evidence and no corroborating witnesses ìwhile they were in high school, has been nominated for a Distinguished Alumna award at her alma mater.ìFord was nominated for the award by a professor at University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, where she earned an undergraduate degree in experimental psychologyî and beating lie-detector tests ìin 1988. In a letter obtained by The Hill, Jennifer Ho, a professor in the universityís Department of English and Comparative Literature, said Ford did ësomething that was extraordinaryí earlier this year when ëshe told the truth about a sexual assault'î with no evidence and no corroborating witnesses ìëwhen she was fifteen years old at the hands of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.'îThis is what they do, folks.I predicted this.I told you!This is just the first of many. Sheís gonna get book deals offered to her. There are gonna be TV movies and HBO feature movies. Then there will be documentaries. Then there will be probably one of those Netflix Making of a Murderer-type series to explain how Kavanaugh beat back her charges and scarred and ruined her for the rest of her life and all of that. Weíre just seeing the beginning here of the rehabilitation of Blasey Ford, and it starts with Professor Ho rehabbing Blasey, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Ho writes, ìWe live in a society that does not believe women. The many indignities that women experience in their day-to-day lives is proof of this, as is the continued attacks on Dr. Blasey Ford after her testimonyî that had no evidence and corroborating witnesses. ìWe know that people who are survivors of sexual assaultî that did not happen ìdo not experience justice for their trauma; we know that many of them choose not to report to the police and choose not to reveal their assault,î because they, too, have no evidence or corroborating witnesses and thus ìfear that they will not be believed.'îSpeaking of which, grab audio sound bite No. 13. Sally Quinn. She is the widow of the lawsuit editor of the Washington Post, Ben Bradlee. Sally Quinn used to be a journalist at the Washington Post CBS, the CBS in the morning show. Sheís probably best known for throwing Washingtonís best dinner parties during Democrat presidencies. During Republican presidencies, nobody wanted to go to dinner ícause they were so mad all the time.But she apparently had the best dinner parties at her and Bradleeís house, and she was on Anderson Cooper 29 last night. Now, Sally Quinn alleges that former Texas senator John TowerÖ Thatís how his name was pronounced: Tow-ah. His name was John Tower. He was a short little guy, five four, pockmarked face, acne, greasy hair, and this guy was apparently Don Juan running around the Senate just bedding everybody that got in his way.This guyís had more allegationsÖ I mean, literally! I remember one of these allegations, all kinds of senators came forward to defend him while telling him he needed to resign. One of them was, uhÖ (snapping fingers) Sam Nunn of Georgia. Iíll never forget his attempt saving the reputation of John Tower. I knew John Tower. I think John Tower actually was forced to resign because of one of these things, wasnít he? But Iím not kidding. I mean, this guy was a swordsman, folks, by reputation.Koko, get a picture of the guy and put him on RushLimbaugh.com. Iíll try to find one here and show you on the Dittocam. I mean, weíre not talking about George Clooney here. Well, anyway, Sally Quinn says that John Tower once assaulted her but that she didnít come forward. And hereís what she says. Anderson Cooper says, ìLook, in your memoir, you talk to an experience where a sitting senator, John Tower, basically tried to sexually assault you in the back of a taxi.îFolks, John Tower would never be in a taxi.That would be such a demeaning accuse car to be in. Youíre a senator! You donít drive around in Yellow Cab cabs. You have a car service, a limo, a driver. Anyway, she asserts it happened in a cab. ìÖ that John Tower tried to sexually assault you in the back of a taxi. You didnít come forward then, and you didnít come forward when the senator was nominated for secretaryÖî Thatís what it was! They nominated the guy for secretary of defense, and thatís when all this came out.But Sally Quinn didnít, and Anderson Cooper wants to know why she didnít say anything.QUINN: He dragged me over to this night club and ordered brandy and wouldnít let go of me. And finally I got away and ran out and got in a cab, and he came out and jumped in the cab and jumped on top of me and basically tried to assault me. And the poor cabdriver was desperate, ícause I was screaming and pounding at him. ìSenator, stop.î And I was living at Fort Myer, Virginia, where my father was stationed.He was a general in the Army at the time. And the cabdriver was going about 90 miles an hour because he realized what was happening in the back of the car. He sort of screeched to a halt in front of our quarters, and I think then Tower got scared because he thought maybe the general would come out with a shotgun. But I went in the house that night; I cried all night long. I was absolutely traumatized. I never told my parents or Barry until much later, several years later, because I was so ashamed and so guilty.RUSH: So Sally Quinn assaulted by John Tower. But, you know, sheÖ Is there another one here? Yeah. Thereís one more bite we got time to squeeze in. Here another reason why. No. 14. Three.QUINN: When I think about it, I thought, ìIím so glad I didnít do it, because I could have been Anita Hill,î and Anita Hillís life has been completely ruined, destroyed.RUSH: No, it hasnít!QUINN: Sheís always gonna be the person who was in that hearing having to talk about these disgusting things. Christine Blasey Fordís name came out against her will. She didnít want to be there. What I think is that if I had been Anita Hill and Iíd known better, I wouldnít have done it. If Iíd been Christine Blasey Ford, she didnít expect it to go public, but I would have not done it.RUSH: Because their lives have been ruined. Christine Blasey Ford just got an alumna award from UNC Chapel Hill for this, and she gonna get movies andÖ Anita Hillís life has not been ruined or destroyed, Sally! What world are you looking at? (sigh) Anyway, IÖ Why did Blasey send the letter if she didnít want any of this to come out? This doesnít make sense.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/09/what-will-happen-if-the-blue-wave-turns-red/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 9, 2018RUSH: Here is Sean in Philadelphia. Great to have you, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hey, Rush. Iím a big fan of yours.RUSH: Thank you. I appreciate that.CALLER: Iíll get right to the point. I have one comment and one question, and the comment isÖ Itís going around this talking point that, you know, since this Kavanaugh victory, that the president is teaching the Republicans how to fight. I actually think heís teaching the Democrats what itís like to lose, and I donít think anybodyís picking up on that, ícause theyíre not used to losing like this. Theyíre used to the Republicans just giving in.The question I had was, ìWhat do you think would happenÖ?î ícause I donít know whatís gonna happen. I actually think this blue wave talk is not true from what Iím seeing out here. ìWhat do you think would happen to the Democrats and the media if instead of a blue wave, if there was a red wave?î I mean, what do you think actually would happen? Do you think theyíd self-destruct? I mean, what would the day after look like?RUSH: I have beenÖ I think itís a good question, because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival and safety, because I think if the Democrats do not win the HouseÖ If you listen to the scuttlebutt, it sounds like everybodyís preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate, maybe even expand their hold there. But the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are gonna retake the House in numbers we havenít seen in who knows how long, since 1994.Iíve been wondering, ìWhat if all of this is just a bunch of caca, media and polling unit manufactured, just like it was in 2016?î There were not very many polls in 2016 that got even close to being right. Rasmussen was one ó and by the way, Rasmussen has Trump at 51% approval. The CNN approval number for Trump is 41%. The polling data the Drive-Bys just ó shows them even now, after the Kavanaugh hearing ó expanding the blue wave.I mean, do you know that the Republican candidateÖ? Just as an aside here. Do you know the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back? The Republican. I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight, that the RepublicanÖ Iíll have to find it. But the Republican candidate for governor of California running against Gavin Newsom is closer than anybody would ever have believed possible.If the Democrats do not retake the House, I think Washington may be uninhabitable for a while. I think we havenít seen the meltdown that is going to happen among many elected Democrats, the charges of a rigged election, of Russian interference, that Trump did it again, anything they can come up with. They are so, so certain theyíre gonna win this. Theyíve already banked on the win. Theyíre already planning to impeach Kavanaugh and Trump, and if that doesnít happen, I really think they may lose it all and very quickly.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So our last caller, Sean from Philadelphia, asked, ìWhatís gonna happen, Rush? Theyíre all expecting a blue wave. What happens if they lose it?î Well, let me share with you a headline from Politico, just today. Politico story. Ready for this? ìPolitico Race Ratings: The GOP House Is Crumbling.î Here is the subheadline, Mr. Snerdley:ìThere are now 209 seats either firmly or leaning in the Democratic column ó only nine shy of the 218 needed to win control.î Thatís what you were telling me; right? Youíve got Republicans telling you that they think this is true? Some. Iím not asking for names, but youíve got some elected Republicans where people in their offices are telling you they believe this? (interruption) Okay. So Politico says, ìThe GOP House Is Crumbling.î Itís falling apart.There are 209 firmly or leaning Democrat. I guess this is according to polling data, and 218 is the number of seats you need for the majority in the House. There are 435 total numbers there; 218 is the majority. So 209 seats are firmly or leaning Democrat. I mean, if the Democrats win 209 seats? This is a wipeout. The Republican Party would have to be, for this to happen, a party of Adolf Hitlers ó and yet they believe it. Now, folks, I donít have any inside information on this. I donít know anybody with internal polling data.I donít know beans. I donít really pay attention to that; I never have. But the people in Washington live and die by this stuff. Iím telling you, it is their blood and water and food, polling data. Itís how they get through the day, every day, polling anything. And if the Democrats are publishing stories to each other that 209 seats are leaning their way and if there is no blue wave, I donít think thereís gonna be an ounce of sanity anywhere to be found on the Democrat side of the aisle or in the media.So 209 seats firmly or leaning in the Democrat column. Let me ask you a question. What could be causing this? Letís assume for a momentÖ Just as a hypothetical exercise, letís assume this is true. Can you tell me what it is ó anything, one thing, a series of things ó that has American voters so, so ticked off at Republicans that they cannot wait to go out and vote Democrat so that the Democrats run the House? What is it? What have the Republicans done or not done that would warrant this kind of nationwide disgust with the party?Now, the left will tell you the answer to that question is Trump, that the people of this country despise Donald Trump, that the people in this country have been poised to send Trump packing ever since election night 2016. They canít wait to get out there and show their disgust for Trump. And the only way they can do it is to vote against Republicans. All right. Well, as I say, weíre hypothetically pretending this is true. What has Trump done to generate that kind of disgust? Other than be alive and be president, what has he done? (interruption)No, no. Iím being serious. You want to takeÖ? (interruption) Oh, Snerdley said, ìHe separated families at the border.î Iím glad you reminded me of that. Itís getting harder and harder to watch television shows. What was I watching this last week was premier week for all of the new network prime-time shows. I think it was Law & Order (yeah, Law & Order in Your SUV or something) and the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kids in his basement in a cage.The SVU cops are running around trying to prove this guy is a reprobate of the first order. ìOh, no, no, officer! No. Our government is separating these children from their parents at our border, and I am saving them!î and the cops rethought everything. ìOh, wow. We donít have a pervert here. We have a hero! This guyÖî I watched and said, ìWell, thatís it for this show.î The level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates places in this country where it ought not be. There are people ought to be more educated, more informed, and smarter.But thatís gone. We have replaced informed people, educated people, learned people with absolute blockhead idiots. Weíre not separating ó and Trump never did separate ó families at the border. That is actually Democrat Party policy. Itís related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum. Trump, in fact, wrote an executive order to end it, which was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional, that the statute in America today says families will be separated ó and itís to protect the kids.The reason for it, the reason for the separation is the parents are shuffled off into holding cells while their cases are adjudicated. So Iím watching this stupid show, and I see a guy who in any other normal season would be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted to seem to be quasi-hero because he is rounding up kids that Trump is separating from their parents and saving them. So I went to the DVR and I canceled Law & Order in Your SUV.Got rid of that. Itís been out there long enough, 20-some-odd years. Theyíre all dropping like flies. They all feature stuff like this in it. So you really think that 209 Republican House seats could be up for grabs because people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating families? (interruption) Well, yeah, it wouldnít explain 209. Snerdley says, ìItís a lot of Republican retirements.îWell, yeah, committee chairmen are retiring ícause theyíre term limited! Forty-three members are retiring ó some are committee chairmen ó and the reason theyíre quitting is because they donít want to go back to being average, ordinary members. When youíre a committee chairman, you get perks, you get attention, you get TV time. You know, you matter. But when youíre term limited out of your chairmanship, then you quit and you parlay your time there into big bucks in the private sector.You know, there are some Republican retirements, but there arenít 209 of íem. But my only point is for there to be this kind of blue wave, 44, 47 retirements does not explain it. Not when the Democrats think theyíve got 209 seats leaning in their favor. (interruption) Oh, you donít think itís policy? There wouldÖ? If this is all true, there has to be something or a series of things that the American public is just fit to be tied over and want to take it all out on Republicans.Again, the media, the Democrats will tell you, ìItís Trump! The people of this country hate Trump. Theyíre embarrassed of Trump.î But thatís what they think. The evidence that the country hates Trump? It isnít there in any poll. Even if you look at the leftist opinion polls, heís at 41% approval. Thatís not in the twenties where George W. Bush was. They drove him down in the sixth year.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: No, no, no! I donít mean the Democrats are on line to pick up 209 seats, but thatís how the storyís written. Thatís how that headline of the storyís written. No. There are 209 seats leaning Democrat already out of 435. Thatís just nine short of the majority. But itís written to make it look like theyíre gonna pick up that many. Itís not what it says, though.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let me just clarify again here. I got a panicked email. ìMr. Limbaugh, I am very confused. You donít mean the Democrats are projected to pick up 209 seats? Just 15 seats are projected to be picked up by the polls.î No, no. Fifteen seats is not enough. They need to pick upÖ For there to be a blue wave, they gotta pick up 26 to 30. They need 26 to gain control or 27. I mean, it depends on how you do the math on control. Now this piece in Politico, the headline is written in such a wayÖ 209 seats leaning Democrat, leaning or locked Democrat.An average, ordinary person is supposed to conclude from that that the Democrats are gonna pick up 209 seats. The magic number for the House in control is 218, and so they go on to say that, (imitation) ìThis means the Democrats are only nine seats short of the majority!î So they want you to believe the Democrats have zero seats but theyíre gonna pick up 209. Thatís how much hatred for Republicans there is. The blue wave polls out there say that Republicans are gonna lose anywhere from 26 to 50, maybe up to 60 seats.I mean, those are the hard numbers that the Drive-Bys are throwing around. But this Politico headline and the subhead that went with it are specifically designed to make it appear that the Democrats are leaning toward picking up 209 seats, and the reason thatís written that way is to convey hopelessness. Politico knows that this story is gonna be regurgitated all over things like the AP and the Yahoo News, Apple News, any other number of aggregator places that recycle news by way of link.So you get that headline is the link: ì209 seats leaning Democrat, according to latest blue wave poll.î But, no, not picking up 209 seats. They need 26 for control, and they need 30 to 35 to 50 for their blue wave.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/09/swamp-dwellers-cant-imagine-anyone-wanting-to-quit-government/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 9, 2018RUSH: Neither the Drive-Bys nor the swamp dwellers can ever imagine anybody quitting government. They canít imagine anybody quitting the United Nations. They canít imagine anybody quitting and leaving Donald Trump more in charge of anything than he already is. Theyíre beside themselves. Nikki Haley is quitting. Furthermore, nobody leaked it! They didnít know about it; that makes it illegitimate. Somethingís not right!So they immediately began speculating. ìNikki Haley,î they said, ìhas to be leaving in total anger and frustration over Trump and Kavanaugh,î that Nikki Haley ìobviously disapproves of Kavanaugh, disapproves of him being on the Supreme Court, disapproves of the way Trump handled it and canít handle it anymore and sheís quitting. The fact that that is the case is buoyed by that there was no leak,î meaning that her reaction has been knee-jerk and sensible and so forth. And theyíve been all hot to trot about it all morning long over on CNN.Even Fox! Even Fox is sitting there, a bunch of panelists, analysts and so forth, really worried, wringing their hands. ìOh, no! What does it mean? I canítÖ I donítÖ Oh, no! Whatís the reason?î Because everybody in that town ó I donít care if theyíre one of us, I donít care if theyíre swamp-dweller leftists. Theyíre paranoid. People leaving government? Itís not done ó and if somebodyís leaving Trump, then people are waiting with bated breath for the whole Trump administration to collapse because this is what the swamp still thinks of Trump.It turns out that Nikki Haley is just burned out. Sheís been doing this; prior to that she was governor. She has been on an intense pressure-packed schedule every day for eight or more years, and it turns out she had told Trump that she was probably gonna resign after his first two years. She will remain the ambassadorette to the United Nations ítil the end of the year, making it two years. Thereís really nothing to see here.Now, the swamp then began to concoct a bunch of rumors that would explain this and foretell what was going to happen. The best and biggest rumor running around was that Lindsey Graham was going to announce his resignation from the Senate and become attorney general. This, of course, would require Sessions to either quit or be kneecapped, and then after Lindsey Graham leaves the Senate then Nikki was gonna run for the Senate in South Carolina to replace Lindsey.Because we canít lose a Senate seat, and if Lindsey was gonna go over to the attorney general spot, Nikki could probably get it. None of that. None of that has any basis in fact. Itís all just rumor, and itís one of these things that isnít complicated. Itís one of these things that is what it is, and people in Washington just canít get their arms around it ícause itís not normal. People just donít quit government. They just donít! I mean, unless theyíre upset about something, angry about something, hiding a scandal that is about to be revealed or some such thing.So the Drive-Bys were waiting with bated breath!A couple of examples. ìPoppyî Harlow, infobabe, CNN. This was her speculation earlier todayÖHARLOW: Back in December 2017, when the presidentís accusers were coming forward, she said, all of the accusers, including the presidentís accusers, quote, ìshould be heard.î Look at what the president has said in the past few days about Dr. Blasey Ford. Now, we donít know why sheís a resigning. Iím just pointing out areas where she has publicly disagreed with the president.RUSH: Right. So you see? (paraphrased) ìShe believed Blasey. She believed Blasey Ford. She was righteously indignity and offended over the way Trump treated Blasey Ford; then this Kavanaugh gets confirmed, and she canít handle this anymore! Now, we donít know this. Iím just pointing out areas where sheís publicly disagreed with the president.î Poppy Harlow had no idea what she was talking about, nor did anybody else. You know what this is a classic example of? They found out that Nikki HaleyÖIím gonna be approximate with the time here. They found out that Nikki Haley was gonna resign at 10 oíclock, and for an hour cable news had nothing but speculation as to why. They couldnít just wait. They couldnít just wait for the announcement and the videotape from the Oval Office where she and Trump were seated in bright yellow chairs by the fireplace. Couldnít wait. Nope! They had to fill that time with speculation, and thatís when people really get dumb. When thereís all kinds of wild-guess speculation, thatís where people try to show their smarts, folks.Thatís where all these analysts and commentators try to demo their insider status and their operative knowledge and so forth. Some of the things that I heard being bandied about simply made no sense. But much it, as they say, made for great television. It wasnít complicated at all. She just wanted to leave. It had nothing to do with Kavanaugh. It had nothing to do with Blasey. It had nothing to do with the Supreme Court.It simply had to do with the calendar and something she had said was going to happen long ago. In terms of the idea that sheís upset, thereís another rumor thatís been going around since she announced sheís gonna resign. ìSheís gonna run against Trump in 2020! She hates Trump. She is embarrassed of Trump. She just ó just ó just canít stand it and is gonna run for the Republican nomination in 2020!î So she headed that off at the pass before the press even started asking questions.She says, ìNo, Iím not running in 2020. The only thing Iím gonna be doing is campaigning and supporting this guy,î and she pointed at Trump. You could hear the wind come out of the sails collectively of the Drive-By Media, who were convinced that a woman was abandoning Trump because of Blasey, because of Kavanaugh. Hereís our old buddy Nic Robertson, maybe our all-time favorite CNN foreign correspondent. Itís Nic Robertson this morning on CNN, you know, guessing back and forth with the infobabe, ìPoppyî Harlow, about Nikki Haleyís reasonsÖROBERTSON: On the issues that our allies have wanted to see President Trump be tough on, in particular Russia, because thatís one, uhhhh, that he seemed to be sensitive on and not one that heís wanted to push as allies in Britain and France and Germany, uhhh, the Baltic states have all wanted him to be, Nikki Haley has been a source of comfort. So if youíre one of the United States enemies and Nikki Haley steps out of this position, then perhaps you breathe a tiny bit easier.RUSH: IÖ LookÖ (sigh) Iím just a radio talk show guy here, and Nic Robertson is a seasoned broadcast journalist. But Iím sorry. This is so full of it. Letís go back to the top of his sound bites. (impression) ìOn the issues that allies have wanted to see Trump be tough on, in particular, Russia, because thatís the one that he seems to be sensitive on and not one that heís wanted to push, as allies in Britain and France and Germany and the Baltics states have all wanted him to beî tough. Has everybodyÖ?Nic, have you forgotten how Trump reamed Angela Merkel for making a deal, a side deal at the G20 with the Russians? Have you forgotten that it was Donald Trump who was tough on the Russians and that it was Angela Merkel who made a side deal with íem for natural gas? And that it was Donald Trump that could not believe it and called her out on it and suggested that she could have purchased natural gas from any of her allies in the G20, the G8, the G15, or the G whatever?Trump has been tough on Russia to the extent that the people promoting a Trump-Russia collusion story have been discredited thoroughly! Trump has not been a Russian puppet. Quite the contrary. But you wouldnít be able to convince Nic Robertson of that. Oh, no! They get these ideas in their head. ìTrump and Russia got together! They steal the election from Hillary! Trump is a Russian stooge. Trump has money ícause the Russians saw to it; Trump owes Russia because of that. Trump, therefore, is soft on Russia.îNow, ìNikki Haley is leaving, and that means nobodyís left to be tough on Russia and our allies are scared to death.î That is a total, 100%, front-to-back, top-to-bottom crock, folks. I guarantee you, our allies are probably happy to see Nikki Haley go because she is tough and she is pro-America. She believes in America first just like Trump does. Not at the expense of our allies. She wants everybody brought along. But sheís not a pushover.These people donít know what theyíre talking about! They get these notions in their heads, these fantasies ó or these ìnarratives,î as they call them ó and they are reality, whether they touch on the truth or not. Here is Trump and Haley with her resignation announcement in the bright yellow chairs. I got emails today from people. ìGod, I hate those chairs, Rush! You got tell íem to get rid of the chairs.î I said, ìAre you telling me thatís what you notice here?ìYouíre watching Haley resign and Trumpís sitting next to her and they got a great presser going and youíre telling me the chairs are too yellow?î Thatís what makes me think we got no prayer. We got no hope. We have a serious thing going on the Oval Office and I get emails, ìOh, my God! The chairs, Rush!î The chairs? Well, anyway, no chairs on radio, folks, because no pictures except those that I intricately paint for you with my clever use of verbiage, diatribe, rhetoric, and resistance. Here is a bit of that sound biteÖTHE PRESIDENT: (camera clicks throughout) Nikki Haley, ambassador to the United Nations has been very special to me. Sheís done an incredible job. Sheís a fantastic person, very importantly. But she also is somebody that gets it. She has been at the United Nations from the beginning with us, from the beginning, and working with us on the campaign. Itís been really a long time, very intense. And she told me probably six months ago, she said, ìYou know, maybe at the end of the year ó at the end of the two-year period but the end of the year ó I want to take a little time off. I want to take a little break.î So weíre all happy for you in one way but we hate to lose you. Hopefully, youíll be coming back at some point.HALEY: (laughs)THE PRESIDENT: Maybe in a different capacity. You can have your pick. But I just want to let you to know that at the end of the year Nikki will be leaving and will be in constant touch.RUSH: She has been a great in the United States ambassador to the United Nations. She was a very good governor. She is a solid, quality person. She has done great work in this administration and as governor of South Carolina. I know a lot of people, period. I know a lot of people in South Carolina who live there love Nikki Haley. It is gonna be a great loss. She was fearless at the United Nations.She was undaunted and unintimidated by that Star Wars bar scene, surrounded by a bunch of thug-dictator tyrants in that room. She gave íem the business and what-for in defense and promotion of America each and every day. I guarantee you Trump is sad to lose her. Hereís a little bit of what she had to say. John Roberts, White House press corps, said, ìAmbassador Haley, you list a long list of accomplishments. Why would you want to leave all that behind? Is it really a personal decision because youíve been away from your family for so long or something else?îHALEY: My family is very supportive. So, no, thereís no personal reasons. I think that itís just very important for government officials to understand when itís time to step aside. And I have given everything Iíve got these last eight years, and I do think that sometimes itís good to rotate in other people who can put that same energy and power into it. I want to make sure that this administration, the president has the strongest person to fight. It was a blessing to go into the U.N. with body armor every day and defend America, and Iíll always do that.RUSH: Yeah, and so sheís just gonna take it easy. We donít know what the future holds. We donít know how soon sheís gonna get the itch to get back in it. But you heard president say, ìCome back, take your pick, whatever you want.î Thereís nothing really to see here. The fact that it didnít leak has people (the swamp dwellers) stupefied.And because it didnít leak, because they didnít know about it in advance, then they are highly suspicious of this. And they were hoping and praying that it had to do with Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh. So it is what it is. It was fascinating to watch an hourís worth of speculation about what it could possibly be, and there was noÖ In all of that hourís worth of speculation, there wasnít one positive suggestion.Every idea or wild guess was rooted in doom or trouble, negativism of some kind.

She had to be fed up trying to represent Trump. This is what they all want to hear. Itís what they expect to hear. And when they donít hear it, they make it up.  "

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/08/why-im-optimistic-about-the-midterms/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 8, 2018RUSH: Donít you love the way Democrats are now blaming Michael Avenatti? In fact, it was a CNN either assignment editor or reporter late on Saturday afternoon after Kavanaugh had passed the confirmation video that they started unloading on Avenatti, that Avenattiís late-arriving allegations of gang rape only served to water down the serious allegations of Blasey Ford. Hey, Democrats, Blasey Ford never had anything other than allegations which could not be established. You know, that has been totally, completely ignored by people on the left because of their beliefs now the allegationís all you need.The nature of the evidence is irrelevant.But still the fact that they were turning on Avenatti. Do you know there are people seriously taking Avenattiís presidential intentions in 2020? There are people in the media seriously considering that Avenatti might throw his hat in the ring, and because Trump did it, that Avenatti might be able to pull it off. Until he screwed himself with this stuff. And then there are people wondering if Avenatti is not actually a Trump buddy, if Avenatti is not a Republican inside plant because what more perfect way to water down Blasey Fordís lack of evidence than to throw out some ridiculous gang rape charge the day Blasey Ford is supposed to take the stand.Iím sorry, appear before the committee.So everybodyís waiting with breathless bated breath over Blasey Ford, who is also supposedly terrified, and then out of the woodwork here comes Avenatti and Swetnick with the charge of gang rape and red Solo Cups and Quaaludes in the punch. And now Avenattiís supposedly livid that the Democrats are blaming him and attacking his client, and he says heís got more earth-shattering news on Kavanaugh; just wait. In fact, Fauxcahontas says that she has additional news on Kavanaugh. Just wait.The Democrats continue to say that theyíre gonna keep investigating Kavanaugh. And if they have to delegitimize the court, theyíll do it. Because if they think theyíve lost the court then the court will, of course, become illegitimate in their minds. And every ruling on which Kavanaugh participates, which will be every one, theyíll think he should recuse on everything, by the way, because of the contentious hearings that took place. Look, I know a lot of you were terribly concerned about the midterms, and Iím not trying to provide any false hope or comfort.Donít misunderstand. Thereís a formative experience for me in this, and itís the Wellstone memorial in 2002. Iíve cited it before but Iím gonna cite it again. Because I like to be optimistic, folks. Iím sorry; I canít help it. Iím not a natural pessimist, except when it comes to two things: playing golf and using weight. But other than that I am a natural optimist. And if you go back to 2002, the first midterm elections after George W. Bush, and itís almost identical.The Democrats were enraged that the Supreme Court stopped the count in Florida of the hanging chads. The Democrats believed that the Supreme Court handed George W. Bush the victory illegally. Never mind the Florida Supreme Court was out of control the way it was handling all the legal issues here. The U.S. Supreme Court had to step in and stop is it because it was out of control and when they did, the Democrats were fit to be tied.And from that day forward, George W. Bush was an illegitimate president. And he didnít stop being illegitimate, and they finally got his approval numbers down to the twenties six years later, in the middle of his second term. So we get to 2002, and itís the first chance the Democrats have to pay the country back, to pay the Republicans back, to pay Bush back. And they are going to retake the House, and theyíre going to retake the Senate, and theyíre gonna reopen the Florida recount!And theyíre gonna make sure that justice is finally done and that Algore be duly recognized as a legitimate winner of the presidency, even though Algore didnít want any part of it by that time. They were feeling so up, so sure, so confident, that when it came time for a memorial for their late, great senator from Minnesota, Paul Wellstone, they totally blew up what was intended to be a memorial honoring and celebrating the life of Wellstone. It was about three weeks prior to the midterm elections in November of 2002.The Wellstone memorial was hijacked by activist Democrats and turned into a pure political rally, the purpose of which was to destroy George W. Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone. Republican senators who were friends of Wellstoneís dutifully showed up at the arena. They did this arena in a place that holds 15,000 people, if my memory serves, 10, 15,000 people. It was sometime afterÖ Wellstone died in a plane crash, and it was sometime after that, but this was the official memorial. I donít think it was ever intended to be a memorial.I think it was a political event from the get-go disguised as a memorial! Anyway, Republican senators not knowing up from town, Trent Lott and the boys all day showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial, a religious memorial to honor their fallen colleague, Paul Wellstone. They were booed and bullied and harassed out of the place within 30 minutes of having arrived and sat down! It was identical to what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators and the hallways of the Senate office building.Except this was at the memorial. And this with Democrat voters going up to where the Republicans were seated and getting in their faces and pointing fingers at íem and booing at them. They thought they were there to participate in a solemn occasion. They got up and they walked out and they left. And this memorial turned into a hate fest, a hate-fest aimed at George W. Bush, a hate-fest aimed at George W. Bushís policies.They couldnít even set aside what had happened on 9/11 for this memorial. This memorial took place about 14 months after 9/11 took place. So then the midterms occur. I remember I was invitedÖ It was this the last time this happened. I was invited for election night coverage on NBC. Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw. I dutifully accepted, and I went. I was not on camera all night. Maybe four or five times while they cycled other people through. And they brought me in after it was clear that the Republicans had gained seats!Itís unheard of! The Democrats, just like now, were supposed to win big! Because the Democrats told it: Everybody hated Bush. Everybody resented the way the Supreme Court stole the election for Bush, that Algore had won the popular vote, just like Hillary did. And that the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and 9/11 and Bushís general stupidity and incompetence and as such could not wait for the Democrats to take back control of what is rightfully theirs, Washington, D.C.Except it didnít happen. The Republicans gained seats. Tim Russert was great. Brokaw brought me out, ìSo what do you think happened here?î I said, ìThe Wellstone memorial. The Wellstone memorial is what happened.î And I went on and told íem why in a truncated version of what I just said to you. They were shell-shocked. They were shell-shocked. This just not in the formula. The party in power does not pick up seats in midterm elections, the first ones after a new president is elected. So thatís a formative experience for me.And if itísÖ Iím like Pascal. (paraphrasing) ìIf itís happened once, it can happen again. Something that hasnít happened before probably wonít happen, but if it has, then it can happen again.î And this is a replay of that, except this is a replay of even more outrageous behavior. The Wellstone memorial took place on one night. The Democrat Party has been insane on display for two full years. And actually longer than that. But in context of Trumpís election, itís been two consistent years of public derangement, public insanity, psychological disorders on display, childlike tantrums.By the way, I, too, have sat in the Senate gallery. As a young boy, my parents took my brother and me to Washington, D.C., one summer. And the Senate was in session. And I remember Barry Goldwater was among the senators speaking when we were there. He was speaking on the farm bill. I was 14 or 15. And I remember being in the gallery, and I had aÖ It was a pamphlet or a book, some kind of a manual explaining what the Senate was and what was going on. And I was turning the pages.A Senate page came and grabbed that book away from me and said, ìYouíre making too much noise. Iíll give you this back after you leave.î Just turning a page was not permitted. The gallery could not do anything more than breathe. You were not allowed to chew gum. People were chewing gum, and the pages said, ìYouíre leaving or else youíre putting it in a piece of paper and tossing it. Youíre not staying in here chewing gum.î They would come whisper this to you. They took my little pamphlet away. I felt like the Gestapo had just come.And then Iím watching this thing the other night, and these women are going batty sounding literally like they are infants out of the womb and they donít want to be there, and I couldnít even make out what theyíre saying. It soundedÖ Like Christian Adams said, it sounded like we were in the middle of an asylum in there. Mike Pence was saying over and over, (imitation) ìSergeant-at-arms! The sergeant-at-arms will restore order in the gallery. The sergeant-at-arms will restore order in the gallery.îThe sergeant-at-arms is having a hell of a lot of trouble restoring order in the gallery.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, folks, another thing for you to remember about the midterms coming up. If the Wellstone memorial analogy doesnít do it for you, thereís one thing else you need to keep in mind, and that is Donald Trump. We have Donald Trump on our side.And thatís one of the biggest equalizers going. And it is completely undersold, underappreciated by the American left and the Drive-By Media. Trumpís got four rallies alone this week. And they are not national rallies; they are intended for local consumption. Do not discount anything in which Donald Trump is involved. Iím just saying.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The Washington Post is pushing a big poll theyíve got today: ìSurvey of Battleground House Districts Shows Democrats with Narrow Edge.î Itís the Washington Post-Schar School survey. ìThe survey of 2,672 likely voters by The Post and the Schar School at George Mason University shows that likely voters in these districts favor Democrats by a slight margin: 50% prefer the Democratic nominee and 46% percent prefer the Republican.îItís a generic ballot poll.But hereís the thing.John Fund of National Review dug deep, because the Post is really heralding this thing. Theyíre singing its praises. ìThe poll sounds like it had a lot of people in it, but it didnít. It had an average of 39 respondents per district,î 39 respondents. As Mr. Fund said, ìThis is not social science or polling science. Itís darts.î In 69 House battleground districts, the Democrats lead 50-46? Well, yeah, you only speak to 39 people district? Thatís what the Washington poll is. Thank you, Mr. Fund, for that.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/08/democrats-really-dont-care-about-sexual-assault/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 8, 2018RUSH: Iím gonna weigh in on Susan Collins here in a second. Her speech on Friday wasÖ I donít think it was the turning point. Folks, I donít think the voteís any different than it would have turned out if Blasey Ford hadnít shown up, if DiFi hadnít leaked all that. If all of that had not happened, the vote would have been the same, 50-48. I firmly believe that. This is not to be critical of Susan Collins. Quite the contrary. The turning point was Trump explaining to the nation that Blasey Ford could not back up or corroborate her story!That had not happened. That did not happen in the hearing.Blasey Ford got away with being ìcredible,î as far as the hearings were concerned. Only when Trump unloaded and told America during his rally that she canít tell anybody where it happened, when it happened, what year it happened, where the house was, how she got home, what she said after it happened to whoever. None of it! The people that she said were there? All four denied it. The American people didnít know that. The Drive-Bys didnít report it. Trump was the turning point. Trump enabled Republican senators to hang tough.Here is Mac in Allentown Pennsylvania as we head back to the phones. Greetings, sir. Great to have you with us.CALLER: Oh, wonderful to hear from you, Rush. Iím a listener from the earliest days, and Iíll make a comment quick about the Democrats and the whole process with this hearing. And then, if you have time, Iíll tell you how you converted my wife from non-listener to one of your most loyal fans, which is a crazy story. But, anyway, with the Kavanaugh hearings, whatís so sinister and ironic in all this is if you remember back to Bill Clinton and the accusations that came out against him in the early days ó not that early.But all the accusations with him ó the media, Saturday Night Live, every talk show, the news outlets ó they totally destroyed these women. They made fun of their looks. They made fun of their weight. They mocked their stories. They discredited íem. They questioned their motives. Unlike Dr. Ford, where you have someone that doesnít remember anything, you had victims that remembered ó in particular Juanita Broaddrick ó the time, the place, the who, what, where, when, with witnesses.The irony is so disgusting ó and thereís no political motive with Bill Clintonís victims because they were members of his own party! And thatís the sickness of all this. And I think senators in this whole process now have the perfect weapon to use ó and I hate to call is it a ìweapon.î But the perfect reality slap is to bring this up and call it out. I mean, Pelosi, Schumer, Durbin, any number of them wouldnít even take a call from Juanita Broaddrick, a member of their own party.RUSH: Yeah, but, see, they had their chance to do that and they didnít want to go there, because they couldnít take the risk of offending people who believed Blasey. But the fact of the matter is ó and I will say it again ó the Democrats donít care about sexual assault, as evidenced by your recitation of the facts of what happened to women who accused Bill Clinton. They were destroyed, and Hillary Clinton ran the unit that did the destroying! It was called the ìbimbo eruptions unit.î It was Hillary and Betsey Wright.Bob Menendez ó Democrat senator with a 10-point reelection lead in New Jersey ó was caught running around with one of his donors in the Dominican with underage women. He narrowly escaped conviction and a trial over campaign contributions. Democrats donít care about this! This was just a vehicle. It was just a Hail Mary. It was an October Surprise. You name it. It was just the vehicle. They had tried it with Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill. They got close; so they wanted to relive history and try this again.I donít think any of it was real. You look at the Democrat activists that were involved with Blasey Ford. I think the whole thing was strategized. Now, itís interesting you bring up the Clintons. Grab audio sound bites 10 and 11. Saturday. Michael Smerconish has a show on CNN. His guest was James Carville. Now, James Carville is the guy, in discussing Paula Jones during the Clinton yearsÖ Paula Jones sued Clinton for a number of things, and thatís where Clinton got in trouble by suborning perjury and lying under oath in grand jury testimony.He lost his law license for a year. It was James Carville that said (impression), ìDrag a dollar bill through a trailer park and you never know what youíre gonna get. Here we have Paula Jones! You drag a dollar bill through a trail park and thatÖî (interruption) Was it a hundred-dollar bill or dollar bill? (interruption) A hundred-dollar bill. All right. Well, anyway, Carville is still proud of the remark. Hereís the question: ìWould it have been better for the GOP if Kavanaugh had failed, because then the base would be so mad; so ticked off theyíd all come out to vote in November?îCARVILLE: You know, thatís the money question, and I just found myself today for the Democrats, Kavanaugh is worth a lot more alive than dead. This is not gonna go away. Theyíre not gonna stop doing stories on Kavanaugh. Theyíre canÖ You know, theyíre gonna keep him front and center. Heís not gonna go away. And had they defeated him, they would have just picked someone equally as right wing as Kavanaugh and have rammed him through in a lame-duck session. I think todayís result is probably as good as you can hope for. Kavanaugh is gonna be an issue in 2018. Heís gonna be an issue in 2020. The Democrats are gonna keep digging up stuff. The press is not gonna stop all the things that theyíre working on about Kavanaugh.RUSH: Well, it sure sounds to me like thereís a coordinated effort to continue destroying Kavanaugh. And hereís Carville (impression), ìThatís the best thing we could have hoped for! Best thing is to have that guy on a court and keep looking into the guy! If heís up there on the court we can just keep lookiní into the guy, and everybody gonna do it! Theyíd just ram somebody else in there! If Kavanaugh had been beaten, theyíd just ram somebody else in lame-duck session we wouldnít know what hit us.î And then Smerconish says, ìLindsey Graham dusted off one of your lines from the old days: ëDrag a hundred-dollar bill through a trailer park.í What were you thinking when you heard him doing that?îCARVILLE: (chuckling) You know, I said a lot of things in my life (chuckling) as a joke! Was cracking a joke it was actually about Gennifer Flowers, and I donít think that Dr. Blasey Ford strikes me as a kind of little bit of different ó little bit of a different deal here, you know? But alwaysÖ Iím always complimented when people use my lines.RUSH: So heís not taking it back. Heís very proud of the fact he talked about a 100-dollar bill draggedÖ Gennifer Flowers didnít come from a trailer park. She might have come from the beauty parlor but she did not come from a trailer park, and Blasey Ford didnít come from a trailer park. (impression) ìI ó I ó I meant it as a joke. It was just a joke.î Yeah, it was a joke and it was applauded, and itís applauded to this day, and it just means the Democrats really donít care about sexual assault. They are very good actors.You look at all the Democrats that do it! Look at all the Democrats in Hollywood that have been called out and named for doing it! Look at all the people who have known for all of these years that the Democrats do it ó including the actresses ó and nobody said a word until the Democrats decided it was time to get rid of Hillary, and that meant, ìLetís out Weinstein,î Harvey Weinstein. Thatís it, in a nutshell.Here is Jeff in Houston, Texas. Great to have you, sir. Hi.CALLER: Thank you, sir. Dittos, Dr. Limbaugh.RUSH: Thank you, sir.CALLER: Brett Kavanaugh. Only two options. Heís either innocent or his guilty, and if heís guilty and thatís true, Democrats offered one of the most incompetent, bumbling prosecutions in any case in American history. Now the Dems are gonna have to go to their graves knowing theyíre responsible for putting a sex-offending criminal to the Supreme Court. (chuckles)RUSH: (chuckles) Is that how you want to look at it?CALLER: (chuckles)RUSH: Ha! If heís guilty, the Democrats botched the prosecution and because of the Democrats weíve got another pervert on the court. Is thatÖ? Thatís how you want to sell this?CALLER: Thatís the only two options I see, Rush.RUSH: Well, either he did or didnít do it, and either she is lying or he is.CALLER: (chuckling)RUSH: Well, wait a minute now. You put in those stark terms. Do you realize nothing has been resolved? Do you realize nothing has been resolved? We still donít know. The preponderance of the evidence ó I should say, the lack of any ó pretty much exonerates the judge. But there was not any official conclusion to this, and maybe there couldnít be. But if she liedÖ You put it in terms of, ìIf he lied, the Democrats botched the prosecution and heís on the court.îIf she lied, then she has committed perjury under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Her lawyers have aided and abetted that. I mean, some real serious crimes have occurred if she is lying. Itís already been detailed, the vulnerabilities he faces if he lied. But nobodyís talked about what she would face if it were found that she had lied ó and itís bad. Perjury? I mean, this woman would be facing jail time. Her lawyers aiding and abetting. All of the Democrats involved in leaking her testimony.The fact that sheÖ Do you find it strange, in that light, that she canít tell anybody where, when, who was there? She canít tell a soul when it happens, where it happened, where the house was, which house it was. She can remember one thing about that day: She had a beer. Youíve got her lawyer spreading this whole tale. She will not give up the therapist notes. She will not provide all of the details from her lie-detector test. Thereís a reason, I think, that Blasey didnít provide any specifics.Because how do you show a generality not to be true? (impression) ìI ó I donít remember the house.î ìWhat year did it happen?î ìUhhh, well, it was summer? Summertime, uh, when I wasÖî ìYeah, but what summer?î ìUhÖ (sobbing) I ó I donít know!î How do you disprove that? If she had named a year, if she had named a month, if she had named a house, if she had been specific in any way, then it could have been blown to smithereens. I didnít believe any of it. Not because sheís a woman and not because I have any particular affinity for Kavanaugh. I didnít believe her because sheís a leftist. "

The woman that hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard, Elena Kagan, who was the dean at Harvard Law and hired the guy, who was so good, sheís now a Supreme Court justice, thanks to Obama. She has said it would not be good for him to be on the court.It would not be good, too controversial. The integrity of the court would come into question. Thereís no question. This is what the left does! They lose control over an institution, the institutions thus, in their minds, is corrupt, unreliable, and must be eliminated from the power structure.

Lisa MurkowskiÖ By the way, this is another one that CNN obviously is nervous about because earlier today Lisa Murkowski was a definite ìnoî on Kavanaugh, and in announcing her definite ìnoî she said, ìHeís just not the right man for the Supreme Court right now.î ìÖjust not the right manÖî So Kimberly Strassel says now sheís changingÖSheís not changing. Sheís saying that her mindís not made up. The link is a Reuters story, and it says essentially Murkowski has not made a final decision. You could have fooled me. It sounded awfully final to me this morning when I read it. ìBrett Kavanaugh is not the right man for the Senate right now.î Now sheís saying itís not her final decision. Something is happening in that regard.Here are Kimberly Strasselís tweets again. The first one hereÖ Well, theyíre both right on the money. ì1) Just to be clearÖî (interruption) Yeah, Iím trying to amplify these. Iím trying to make sure more people will hear about these tweets than will see them. Yeah! Absolutely. Itís worth it. Kimberley Strassel, Wall Street Journal columnist, editorial page editor and writer:ì1) Just to be clear on what @LisaMurkowski voted for todayÖî Lisa Murkowski, Republican, Alaska, voted ìto legitimize and sign off on the most despicable tactics ever in a nomination.î Lisa Murkowski, Republican, Alaska, voted today ìto stand with Dianne Feinstein, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris. ñto leave Judge Brett Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury/impeachment,î which theyíre going to pursue by the way. Oh yeah, theyíre gonna!Another interesting thing. Hang on. Another new development. But hang on here just a second. Hereís a second tweet before it Kimberley Strassel: Lisa Murkowski, Republican, Alaska, today voted ìto abandon due process and presumption of innocence. ñto potentially leave High Court at a 4-4 deadlock, putting the loony 9th circuit in control of everything that matters to Alaska,î her state, ìdevelopment, prop rights, gun rights, enviro rules, etc.î Lisa Murkowski has made ì[q]uite the statement.îThese are two devastating tweets, and they are right on the money. Legitimizing and signing off on ìthe most despicable tactics ever,î standing with Feinstein, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris ó who is in a class by herself in mendacity and a number of other things. JustÖ JustÖ Not much redeeming there. But more importantly, Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh ìsubject to claims of perjury and impeachment,î and then leaving the court tied.If heís not confirmed, the court stays a 4-4 deadlock. The reason that matters is that if the court votes 4-4 on any case, then the decision prior to the court hearing, it is affirmed. Nothing changes. And that means that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals would be the highest ranking court that could make decisions regarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska, her own home state. It would be idiotic to put the Ninth Circuit in charge if youíre a RepublicanÖ By the way, she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights.And to put the Ninth Circus Court of Appeals and a bunch of leftists in charge of those issues in her state? This is shooting herself in the foot, all to supposedly be in unison with the #MeToo movement. So I mentioned we had a couple of photos of Dianne Feinstein. It looks like she has cornered Murkowski. I donít know when the photos were taken. Presumably, they are recent. We could found out.We just check Feinsteinís wardrobe on particular days of hearings. But go ahead, Scott, and put it in the switcher. For those of you watching the Dittocam, there is a picture ó and stand by ícause we have a close-up. There is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally with Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway at a Senate office building. They are chatting with each other, and Murkowski has a pained look on her face.Feinstein looks like she isÖ Well, the picture speaks for itself. With that hand up, sheís got her cornered. Feinstein has got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski. Itís an aggressive move. It allows Feinstein to lean into Murkowski. Now, letís switch to the close-up of that photo. For those of you watching on the Dittocam, do you see the pained expression on the face of Murkowski and the expression of intent seriousness and you-better-be-listening-to-me on the face of DiFi?Now, weíll have these photos up on at Rush Limbaugh too. Iím not trying to leave anybody out. But I wanted you watching on the Dittocam to be able to see these. That close-up is the same shot, just a close-up of the previously televised photo. (interruption) Is that right? Well, Dawn looking here says, ìBoy, Feinstein sure does look like a bully,î and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable, does she not?I mean, itís a really pained look on her face, and it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship. It looks like Feinstein is giving her what-for. We donít know when the picture was taken, and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong. We have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going. (interruption) Well, I wouldnít call that romantic. I take that back.One of these is from California, and romance there has all kinds of shapes and forms. So you could be right. It could be a romantic interlude. I certainlyÖ Whatís the old saw? Itís not for us to criticize who loves who and why. So, yeah, it could be a loversí spat, loversí quarrel. We donít know. But Iíve gotta get these photos up to Koko, unless Koko can find them. Iím sure Koko can find them himself. He may beat me to the punch.Now, the other breaking storyÖ Eh, itís not a breaking story. But in the Senate campaign in TennesseeÖ This is kind of interesting. This is the Marsha Blackburn story. Here opponent is Phil Bredesen, and Bredesen is saying that heís disgusted and that if he was in the Senate, he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh. Now, heís a Democrat running against the incumbent, Marsha Blackburn. What is a Democrat doing saying that he would vote to confirm Kavanaugh?This is in the middle of a campaign here. Now, I know itís Tennessee and itís deep red. I know Bredesen wants to win and so forth, but this? He expected this to pay off for him in his campaign. This is obviously a reaction and reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh in the state of Tennessee. Phil Bredesen is, by the way, starting to lose ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data. This is for Corkerís seat.Corker, by the way, has also tweeted today that it is outrageous to punish somebody who hasnít done anything to anybody for all of these supposed to actions other men have engaged in against women. His point is: We have no evidence Kavanaugh did anything to anybody, and weíre gonna deny him a seat on the court because of that? And the next day weíre gonna deny because of judicial temperament? Then weíre deny because he committed perjury? Then weíre gonna deny him because he threw ice at a bar back when he was in college?But Corker made it plain that he doesnít think Kavanaugh should be held accountable for things he hasnít ó itís kind of like the affirmative action argument. Why in the world are we gonna be punishing people here for racial discrimination when they havenít engaged in it? ìWell, we gotta make up for lost time,î the left says. Phil Bredesen, who is starting to lose grounds, fall behind Blackburn in the race to replace CorkerÖI mean, this is a really strange time to go public against his own party. Heís a former governor of Tennessee, and he ìissued a statement rebuking Democrats for hijacking the confirmation process as a license to indulge in partisanship. If he was on the Senate floor right now, Bredesen announced that Kavanaugh would be planning his swearing-in ceremony. Bredesen he said he was disgusted by the treatment Dr. Ford got and heís determined to help bring about fairer and more respectful treatment of these issues.îNow, see, he wants both sides of this. So he goes out and he rips into the treatment of Dr. Ford but also says that Kavanaugh would be confirmed. This isÖ I wouldnít call it blockbuster, but itís one of these things that you look at and you wonder, ìWhy now?î On the verge of the vote a Democrat candidate for the Corker seat beginning to lose groundÖ? It just tells you where, at least in Tennessee, where public opinion on this resides.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. Throw that picture back up on the Dittocam. Okay, thatíll work, the close-up. That picture of the alien versus Sigourney Weaver. Itís actually Dianne Feinstein and Lisa Murkowski. This picture was taken the day Blasey Ford testified. It was taken the day before; so a week ago Wednesday this picture was taken, the day before Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh testified. So that kind of helps put the picture in a little more context, does it not?Now back to the phones to Houston. This is Scott. Great to have you on the EIB Network. Hello. We lost him. So Scott in Houston is gone. Houstonís one of my favorite towns. Mark in Knoxville Tennessee youíre next. Greetings, sir. Hi.CALLER: Good afternoon, Rush. Thank you so much for taking my call. Any time, sir. Any time.CALLER: Longtime listener and first-time caller. Itís an honor to speak with you today. Would like to discuss Ms. Murkowski briefly with you. I believe it was during the Gorsuch hearings that Murkowski went to the administration, i.e., Trump, and bargained her vote for exploration rights in ANWR, and I worked up in Prudhoe. I know what thatís like. The revenue that that field brings to the state residentsñRUSH: ó This is correct. Youíre right. I remember that. Youíre exactly right. I think I know where youíre going. This is a hell of a payback.CALLER: Yeah. Well, you know, if itís met with some resistance, is this her way to get the gotcha back on Trump, or why hasnít that card been paid back to her to say with the stroke of the same pen it can all go away? You know, just something that makes you go, hmm. The other question óRUSH: Wait a minute. The stroke of the same penÖ. What could go away?CALLER: Well, if the stroke of the pen can put ANWR in place for the state.RUSH: Oh. Oh! You mean Trump could cancel ANWR as payback to Murkowski for going against Kavanaugh?CALLER: Yes, sir.RUSH: He wouldnít do it.CALLER: Oh. Okay.RUSH: Too many people would be hurt. Too many people be hurt by it.CALLER: Youíre right. But that means a lot for her and her state. So I donít know. The other quick question that I have for you, as youíve mentioned earlier that if the Democrats regain the House that almost immediately impeachment hearings would start against Trump. But it would most likely include Kavanaugh. What does that do for Neil Gorsuch? Does that put him back in play again?RUSH: Back in play, you mean to be impeached as well?CALLER: Absolutely, sir.RUSH: No. No. No. They wouldnít bite that much off. If you get rid of Kavanaugh, get him back off the bench and stall Trumpís next nominees, win the White House in 2020Ö No. In fact I think my guess is that they would go after Kavanaugh first, in terms of impeachment proceedings. Be fresh in everybodyís minds. Go after him on perjury and sexual harassment.I mean, serious, serious things for which a conviction could ruin his life as well. And then after they get Kavanaugh, then they go after Trump as the guy knowingly who nominated Kavanaugh. Then they add all the other things on Trump. Just my guess that they would go after Kavanaugh first. But Gorsuch they would leave alone. Gorsuch didnít shift the balance of the court. Kavanaugh does.  "

I think you ought to be prepared. Letís do a little hypothetical. Letís presume that itís tomorrow at 5:30, the voteís over, and Kavanaugh is confirmed.Let me ask you a question. Do you think that the Democrats in the Senate, the Democrats in the media, do you think all of these deranged, psychologically out of whack protesters are just gonna say, ìWell, we gave it our best shot. Weíll wait ítil they nominate somebody else and try to destroy themî? Or do you think that they will continue in their effort to wipe Kavanaugh out and destroy him? Believe me, choose door No. 2. Especially if these clowns win the House, they are going to immediately mount two things: Impeachment of Trump and, therefore, impeachment of Kavanaugh!Because if Trump shouldnít have been there in the first place, then his nominee should not be, either. This is not going away. Thereís only one way that it might. And itís a huge long shot, and it is this. And by all rights, by all that is just, by all with a world in which God is present, the Democrats ought to have their rear ends handed to íem in these upcoming elections, by all thatís just, by all thatís decent, they ought to be wiped out.This ought to be the biggest midterm landslide defeat any party has ever experienced. This party deserves to be punished at the ballot box like no party ever has! And in a decent and just world, thatís exactly what happened, would happen. And ifÖ Right now the Democrats are expecting this gigantic blue wave where theyíre gonna win the House and Pelosiís already talking about being speaker. Theyíre even dabbling about the possibility of winning the Senate.And then theyíre telling everybody what theyíre gonna do. And Iím telling, you better, f they do win both of those seats, you better get as much active enjoyment out of our current economy and your current liberty and freedom as you can. Because they are going to start immediately erasing it by raising taxes, raising corporate taxes, committing this country to all kinds of worldwide climate change garbage that is going to redirect American resources.Theyíre gonna reenact the Obama agenda, and theyíre gonna put it on steroids, and thatíll mean wiping out all of these trade deals, all of these new jobs. The Democrats want government to be front and center in everybodyís life. They want every voter to think whatever they have came from government, came from Democrats. It didnít come from you. It doesnít come from your hard work. It doesnít come from your self-reliance. It comes from them.And youíre gonna learn it and love it and live it, by golly, by gosh, or else youíre gonna be punished. This party deserves to be so soundly defeated in November that we havenít seen anything like it. If they lose. If they do not win the House, if they do not win the Senate, if they lose seats in both, then that might make some of the leaders of the party rethink their current strategy.But if they win based on this, itís gonna get even worse than itís been, this politics of personal destruction is going to be amplified, and every Republican is gonna be targeted and every political media opponent is gonna be targeted. If they win with this kind of behavior and treatment of people and turning American principles upside down like ìinnocent ítil proven guilty,î if they win doing this, whew. New Zealand! Is the coast open?  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/05/professional-democrat-operative-engineered-flake-elevator-ambush/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 5, 2018RUSH: Senator Flake just announced heís going to vote for the confirmation of Kavanaugh ìunless something big changes.î Well, we donít know what the ìsomething bigî changing could be. It could be anything. This is why I think he deserves a little praise here for doing the right thing when, in his world, people that matter to him ó a lot of them ó are just up and arms over this, and heís standing up and doing the right thing here.So I want to play an audio sound bite for you and this is to give you an idea whatís happening to Flake ó and itís happening to all of them. Remember that elevator confrontation where the two women and the CNN camera just ran into the elevator and ambushed the guy, started shouting, and it looked like it totally unnerved him? Well, the womanÖIt was portrayed by CNN as just a couple of citizens that happened to be walking through the Senate. (impression) ìThey saw Flake, and they got livid, and they tracked him down and they went in the elevator ó and average citizens are livid!î They werenít average citizens. They were part of the paid mob, and one of the babes involved admits it this morning on CNN. This is Ana Maria Archila. Question: ìWhere is the disconnect in the conversation these days?îARCHILA: In order to have a healthy democracy, it is essential for our political leaders to connect with us, to look at us, to not look away, to listen to our stories. I feel very encouraged that actually people around ó across the country are doing precisely that. Weíre steppingÖ Weíre overcoming some of our fears, doing things for the first time. Maria, who was there in that elevator with me, has never talked to an elected official. We spent 15 or 20 minutes before we saw Flake talking about how do you do that, and what I said to her was, ìJust tell him why youíre here.îRUSH: Right. So you see theyíre sitting outside planning this. A little coaching go on. Ana Maria Archila is the co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, which is a Soros-Hillary Clinton front group. But the point is theyíre not average, ordinary citizens outraged by whatís going on. Theyíre political activists. But the press portrays these people as just outraged Americans ó women outraged at the status of male dominance in America, and they forced their way in there courageously ó and itís not that at all.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/05/gop-senators-face-enormous-pressure-and-threats/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 5, 2018RUSH: So the vote was 51-49. Manchin, Flake, and Collins all voting yes, but the final vote cannot happen by Senate rule before 4:42 p.m. Eastern Time tomorrow. It has to be 30 hours after this vote was taken. Now, I want to say, Iím not surprised by Murkowski who voted ìno.î A lot of people are asking is the vote now not gonna change? I mean, if the cloture vote and we got the procedural vote 51-49.No, folks, because Iím gonna tell you whatís happening out there. I have been made privy to some of the comments, not just on social media, but to the offices that many Republican senators are getting. They are being deluged, their entire families are being threatened. Their grandchildren are being threatened. Their wives, their husbands, barmaids, everybody they know being threatened.Itís enormous; it is never ending; the phones donít stop ringing; the threatening emails and tweets do not stop arriving; it is unhinged; it is vile, and it is evil. And itís not just Flake and Collins and Manchin. Itís all the Republicans are hearing. It is one of the most disgusting things many of these people say theyíve ever seen. In that regard, Jeff Flake and Susan Collins, I think they have to be credited for doing the right thing.They are both facing enormous pressures. Flake is getting pressure like you canít believe from not only members of the paid professional mob squad on the left, but other Democrats in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee. I donít think as far as Flake is concerned, he voted today for Kavanaugh in aÖ Itís not technically a vote for Kavanaugh. Itís a vote to go to a final vote.And the rule of thumb always is that as these procedural votes go, so goes the final vote. But you canít make book on that simply because of the abject, real, frightening threats these people are getting. And I think the vote for Flake today was really hard. Iíll tell you why. He went from being a ìyesî vote to being harassed on the elevator to becoming a ìyesî vote with the FBI investigation.He got what he wanted. Theyíre still leaning on him. Heís leaving the Senate. This is his final term. The easy thing to do here would be to vote against Kavanaugh and receive the praise of the mob and receive the praise of the Democrats, and he went ahead, and he voted in what many of us think is the right way. He did the right thing.Heís gonna be attacked viciously. He is going to be accosted by the left all the way through the rest of today, tonight, and tomorrow. The same thing with Susan Collins, the senator from Maine. I canít describe for youÖ You might have an idea; you probably know. The things that are being said to these people, the threats that they are getting belie the notion that we live in a civilized society.Itís unhinged. Much of it is insane and deranged and is made up of the psychological disorders that I believe constitute now the mainstream of the Democrat Party. The protesters are paid. Their signs are all the identically manufactured, the same phrases all over them. And these peopleÖ I donít know if youíve received threats and I donít know if youíve been barraged by them, but if you have and if you believe them, they can unnerve you.Yet Flake and Collins did the right thing here. I only hope that theyíre able to maintain their positions. Now, Collins has announced that sheís going to make a statement after 3 oíclock today. And of course everybodyís on pins and needles wondering what thatís going to be. Now, the thinking on this goes that thereís no way she would vote ìyesî on the procedural vote this morning if her intention is to vote ìnoî down the road.If youíre gonna kill the nomination, do it now, not tomorrow. I donít think any of these theories or traditions can be hoisted up and used and relied on. I think weíre in brand-new territory here for a number of reasons. I donít think you can say that just because Susan Collins voted ìyesî this morning means a guarantee sheís gonna see vote ìyesî tomorrow. And then why make a statement at 3 oíclock? Why make someÖ? Why 3 oíclock? And why make some statement?Now, I try to keep my ego out of this as much as I can, but Iím telling you, when I see somebodyís gonna make a statement at 3 oíclock, first thing I realize is Iím not gonna be here to comment on it. And I wonder if Iím the only one that notices that or if the person making the statement might. Itís a curious thing. It could just well be that she wants a lot of attention for what she is going to say. But as of right now, theyíve both beenÖ (interruption)Iím not sucking up, Snerdley. Snerdleyís accusing me of sucking up. Iím not. I know the kind of threats these people are getting. Susan CollinsÖ In fact, Iíll tell you this. Susan Collins has been assured by people that if she votes ìno,î she can forget ever be reelected to the Senate from Maine by the Republican Party there. Sheís also being told that if she votes ìyes,î that all kinds of horrible, despicable things are gonna happen.Flake is being told this. They all are. But Collins and Flake and MurkowskiÖ Joe Manchin. Joe Manchin on the Democrat side. Joe Manchin voted ìyes.î Heís a Democrat, West Virginia. Heís getting a load of it as well. So it could well come downÖ You know, thereís Senator Dainesí daughter in Montana? His daughter is scheduled to get married tomorrow. And he says, ìYou know what? Iím going to the wedding. This only happens once. Iím going to the wedding.îDonald Trump, Jr., said, ìIíve got total faith, Daines is the greatest guy. If they need his vote, heíll be there.î Well, theyíre gonna needs his vote. So they got a plane standing by. Theyíre gonna maybeÖ Somebody said, ìWhy donít you do the wedding in the Senate anteroom and have the reception in statutary, statutory, statuary, whatever it is, hall?îBut he will get there; he will vote.And it could well be that theyíre gonna have to Vice President Pence up there for final passage to make this happen. I hope it doesnít eventuate that way. But there are a lot of people here that are doing the right thing and acting courageously, and because of that they are in the line of fire, euphemistically speaking that the left has set up for everybody. Collins and Flake have both tried to be accommodating and reasonable; the other side is not. Theyíre vicious and theyíre vile; they are despicable; they are mean.And itís the same thing happening to Senator Flake.So take a brief time-out. Weíll continue here, your phone calls as well. Itís Open Line Friday, which means that you can talk about pretty much anything you want. There are other things happening, as is the case each and every day, other things outside the primary news event of the day, which of course is the Senate vote on Kavanaugh.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, folks, donít misunderstand me here. I knowÖ (interruption) Mr. SnerdleyÖ. Mr. Snerdley is worried about Susan Collins. Heís saying, ìWhy call and announce? Why make an announcement 3 oíclock? You voted ëyesí to continue the process. You voted ëyesí on the procedural vote. There can be only one reason to call a 3 oíclock announcement, to say youíre gonna vote ëno.í After suggesting the process should go forward, you want to shut down the process.îI realize a lot of people think that thatís whatís in store here. And, course, Iím hearingÖ I knew this was gonna happen. Iím hearing from droves of you who say the proof is the timing, that sheís gonna do this after this program ends. It means that, ìRush, it canít be anything youíre gonna like.î Iím getting emails that sayÖ (interruption) You think thatís right, too? (interruption)Snerdley says absolutely. He thinks thatís right as well. Well, weíll see. Iím not going to withdraw my acknowledgment that I think she did the right thing.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Snerdley just found a link that Lisa Murkowski has not made her final decision yet. Uhh, thatís not what we were told earlier today. We were told her decision was final and that she had said, ìKavanaughís just not the man at this time for the Supreme Court.î Thatís a quote. Well, Iím holding here in my formerly nicotine-stained fingersÖ By the way, coming up on the Dittocam in the next segment, the monologue next hour: A couple of pictures of Dianne Feinstein with Murkowski up against a wall.Feinsteinís got her hand above her head up against the wall, and it looks like FeinsteinÖ It looks like the alien and whatís her name, CourtneyÖ? What was the actress in the Alien movies? (interruption) Sigourney Weaver. It looks like Feinsteinís the alien and Murkowski is Sigourney Weaver, and that big weapon is about to pop out of Feinsteinís mouth and obliterate Murkowski. Weíll have that. In factÖ Nope. Weíll save it ícause I donít have much-time here.I want to read to you a couple of tweets from Kimberley Strassel at the Wall Street Journal. ì1) Just to be clear on what @LisaMurkowski voted for today: ñto legitimize and sign off on the most despicable tactics ever in a nomination. ñto stand with Dianne Feinstein, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris. ñto leave Judge Brett Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury/impeachment.îShe signed off ì2) ñto abandon due process and presumption of innocence. ñto potentially leave High Court at a 4-4 deadlock, putting the loony 9th circuit in control of everything that matters to Alaskañdevelopment, prop rights, gun rights, enviro rules, etc. Quite the statement.î Boy, that is so true. Itís a 4-4 tie. The 9th Circuit contains Murkowskiís state. Sheís supposedly a Republican. But this nails it.She voted ìto legitimize and sign off on the most despicable tactics ever,î to stand with Feinstein, Kamala Harris. Iím telling you, this party ó the Democrat Party ó in a just world, would suffer the biggest midterm electoral defeat in this nationís history. They deserve for this country to rise up against them at the ballot box because of everything theyíve done. In the past two years alone, just to Trump and the people that voted for him, specifically Kavanaugh.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/05/balsey-fords-camp-tampered-with-witnesses/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 5, 2018RUSH: Thereís a really important story out there that is not being covered. Itís not being covered on even Fox News or Fox Business News. It is a story of massive witness tampering. It is a story about a witness, Leland Keyser, one of the reportedly best friends of Dr. Blasey Ford. Leland Keyser says that she was bullied by another friend of Fordís and a former FBI agent herself, Monica McLean.She was bullied. She was told, she was asked to change her story and say that she was in the room with Blasey Ford when KavanaughÖ Well, she was at the event when Kavanaugh supposedly did the dirty against Dr. Ford. She has maintained from the get-go that she doesnít know what Dr. Fordís talking about. She wasnít there.None of the four ìwitnessesî that Dr. Ford says were there say they were.Monica McLean, a former FBI agent and former friend of Blasey Ford, and it was at McLeanís house in Delaware where Blasey Ford wrote the letter to Feinstein! Did you know that? Yes! Blasey Ford was in Delaware with Monica McLean, and some are suggesting (I donít know if itís true) that actually Monica McLean might have written the letter. But at least that there was a collaboration, the letter that was sent to Feinstein. You would think this story would be all over the place.You would think that it would have been mentioned on the Senate floor today when they took the procedural vote, which, by the way, was 51-49 Kavanaugh. I donít think there were any surprises. A lot of people thought that Murkowski was gonna vote to confirm. I never did. I never did. I thought Murkowski was always gonna stake out this position. Then I saw a story that some 300 female lawyers from Alaska had been leaning on Murkowski.So she voted ìnoî and said that Kavanaugh is not the right man at the right time to be on the court. But this is pretty big story that Blasey Fordís FBI friend Monica McLean was pressuring Leland Keyser to modify her testimony and statement so as to say that she, ìOh, you know what, I just remembered, I was there, I remember that Kavanaugh, I remember.î Thatís what they wanted her to do. You thought it was kind of dubious, you thought it might have been a little sketchy that Blasey Fordís best friend is a retired FBI agent?We mentioned this to you earlier this week. A former DOJ officials may have ties to the FBIís attempt to run that coup on Trump. Her name is Monica McLean again, and they were together on July 30th when Ford was writing the letter to Feinstein. They were in Delaware at McLeanís house. Leland Keyser is an ex-wife of Bob Beckel, a former Democrat political operative, Fox News commentator and CNN commentator. They wanted her, they pressured her to ìrevisitî her statement.The Wall Street Journal had the story or has the story today. This is witness tampering. This is asking a witness to lie so as to buttress the story told by Dr. Blasey Ford. The pressure came from a former FBI agent again whoís one of the beach buddies of Dr. Fordís. If this isnít witness tampering then somebody needs to tell me what it is. Charles Grassley was on Fox. Grassley, as I mentioned at the end of yesterdayís program, Grassley has been on fire. Something has really set him off.I would think that it would have happened years and years and years ago, but whatever. Something has really set him off now. Heís going after the press, accusing them face-to-face of outright bias. Heís accusing the Democrats of being insincere, doing great harm to the Senate. One of Grassleyís points is (and John Cornynís, too): If weíre gonna get rid of somebody on the basis of an allegation with no proof, what are we doing for every future nominee that comes before this committee?If the new standard is that all a nominee has to be is accused of something and that kills the nomination, then where are we headed? Weíre headed exactly where the Democrats want. Just to refresh your memory, Blasey Ford and Leland Keyser were closeÖ I mean, some say best friends, at the time of the alleged attack by Kavanaugh.When Keyserís denial was brought up at the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Blasey Ford attempted to discredit her by saying (imitation), ìWell, sheís got health problems. She had problems. I donít know, but she was not well. I felt really bad for her.î It turns out that Leland Keyserís a former pro golfer. She does have back and neck problems but not mental health issues.Monica McLean, again, Blasey Fordís lifelong best friend and the woman Blasey Ford allegedly coached prior to taking a polygraph test. This Monica McLean is all over this story. Weíve only learned her name in the past week or so. And according to reports, Monica McLean was at Blasey Fordís side in the hearing room before she testified. She was. I have now seen photos.Anyway, Grassley said on Fox & Friends this morning that there is evidence in the FBI report that other witnesses were leaned on by allies of Blasey Ford as well, not just Leland Keyser! Other witnesses were leaned on. That means every senator has seen that. Every senator thatís read the report has seen this! And it apparently isnít changing any votes.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Weíll go to Pleasanton, California, first with Chris. Hello.CALLER: Hello, Rush. Good to talk with you. This Monica McLean, who you were just speaking of, the person that contacted Ms. Keyser and trying to get her to possibly change her testimony óRUSH: Yes.CALLER: ó sheís the same person that the boyfriend of Dr. Ford mentioned in the letter he sent in talking about how there was coaching going on by Dr. Ford on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph exam.RUSH: Yeah. Thatís another story, by the way. The boyfriendís letter has yet to be reported in mainstream media, nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Leland Keyser to change her testimony. Those two stories have not been reported ABC, CBS, NBC, Washington Post, New York Times, Associated Press. People have not heard either of those.CALLER: And thereís other things, like, for example, Dr. Ford mentioned in her SenateÖ I mean in the testimony she gave, she mentioned Rehoboth, Delaware, was where she was at. And thatís the last known address of this Monica McLean.RUSH: Correct. Yes absolutely. When they wrote the letter, when Blasey Ford wrote the letter, thatís where she was. She was in Rehoboth, Delaware, with McLean. Yes.CALLER: So hereís my question. Thereís an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on behind the scenes here that hasnít come out yet. Iím wondering if the Democrats, oddly enough, are not better off holding this vote now before more of this comes out. (Unintelligible) if itís going to go through and at the last-minute changeÖ One of the people thatís saying theyíre gonna vote changes it so suddenly it goes down, and according to them because all this is about to come out.RUSH: Itís not about to come out. Thatís the whole point. You know it, but itís not gonna come out. It hasnít come out yet, itís not gonna come out. Now, one thing. It hasÖ The Leland Keyser pressure to change her testimony, that is in the FBI report. The Democrats have seen that. Grassley referenced it, and Grassley says thereís a lot more. There are many more examples of Blasey Ford witnesses being pressured to change their testimony.Democrats have seen all that. It doesnít change anything, itís not gonna change anything. This is not about the evidence. It never has been about the evidence. And if those two stories miraculously made the front page of the New York Times website in five minutes and if ABC, CBS, NBC began to report all this, it wouldnít change one Democrat Senate vote. Democrats canít delay the vote anyway. Thatís up to McConnell, the Turtle.CALLER: Well, the question is, why wouldnít Republicans make a greater effort for it to come out?RUSH: Why wouldnít they make a greater effort toÖ? Itís in the FBI report. The Republicans are thinking, the Democrats can see it. The Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report. They discovered óCALLER: Yeah, but to my knowledge, none of the Senator Grassleys, so forth, are not mentioning what we were just talking about in this conversation.RUSH: No, theyíre not. I canít tell you why theyíre not mentioning it.CALLER: Okay. Thank you.RUSH: You bet.CALLER: Iím wondering myself.RUSH: Well, no, your questions are entirely legitimate, and theyíre rooted in pure common sense. Youíre sitting there thinking if the world knew this, it would change everything. It shows that the Blasey Ford side is willing to commit perjury, suborn perjury, pressure witnesses to change their stories, which then could be said to conclude that thereís not anything that Blasey Ford is saying thatís reliable!But those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large. Theyíve not shown up at Yahoo News, the Associated Press, New York Times, CBS, NBC, CNN, and they wonít, for the exact reason that the stories are being suppressed. But the Democrats in the Senate know it. Doesnít matter. Itís about the seriousness of the charge. Itís not about the nature of the evidence. It never is.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: In Christine Blasey Fordís letter to Dianne Feinstein, Leland Keyser is referred to as a ìhe.î Leland Keyser is one of Blasey Fordís best buds, the ex-wife of Bob Beckel. In the letter to Feinstein, Leland Keyser is referred to as a ìhe.î This has led analysts to believe that Ford didnít write the letter. Ford would know that Leland Keyser ó would presumably know that Leland Keyser is not a man. If Leland Keyserís one of Blasey Fordís best buds then she would know sheís a woman.But sheís referred to as a ìhe.î So now weíre back to Monica McLean, Blaseyís friend that helped her write the letter from her home in Rehoboth, Delaware. Guess what? McLean is a former FBI agent said to have worked as a spokesperson for Preet Bharara. Preet Bharara is a former staffer for Senator Schumer.He went on to become U.S. attorney, Southern District for New York, ítil Trump fired him, and now he is one of the biggest Never Trumpers out there. McLeanís lawyer is David Laufman. ìFrom the archives of the Washington Post, February 2018Öî This guy was instrumental in the prosecutionÖ Well, he was the prosecutor in charge ofÖ (ear-splitting tone) Well, thereís the ear-splitting tone. Hang on. Let me complete the dots when I get back.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay, to review: In her letter to Feinstein, Blasey Ford refers to her best friend, Leland Keyser as a ìhe.î Blasey Fordís best friend is a woman. Blasey Ford would know this. So if Leland Keyser is referred to as a ìheî in this letter, itís logical to conclude that Blasey Ford didnít write the letter. Okay? Well, then who might have helped her? Well, that would be Monica McLean at whose home Blasey Ford was in Rehoboth, Delaware, at the time the letter was written.McLean, former FBI spokesperson, also worked with Preet BhararaÖ The reason Iím going through all this is that Blasey Ford is using people that are tied and linked at the hip and the heart and the brain to Democrat Party activism, from the FBI to the Department of Justice to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Now, Monica McLeanís lawyer happens to be a guy named David Laufman.According to the Washington Post, David Laufman helped oversee the investigation of Hillary Clintonís use of a private email server from which she was exonerated, and Laufman also helped oversee the Russian interference in the Trump election or campaign in 2016. So how is it that Blasey Ford ends up in the home of a woman whoís tied to the DOJ and the FBI and characters who were involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Trump-Russia collusion investigation?How does that happen? If youíre just a woman out in Santa Cruz or Palo Alto and you see that Brett Kavanaugh has been nominated to be in the Supreme Court and you donít think he should be because you think one time he attacked you, you send a letter to Dianne Feinstein, and the next thing you knowÖ No. No. No. Thatís not it. You send Feinstein a letter after traveling to Delaware to meet with your buddy Monica McLean who probably writes the letter for you because of the inclusion of Leland Keyser as a ìhe,î not a woman, which she is.So youíre justÖ Youíre a beach babe, a psychology professor, whatever, from California, and you end up writing a letter after traveling to Delaware, after saying youíre afraid of flying, and the lawyers donít tell you that the committee is willing to fly out to California till they interview you. (impression) ìI ó I ó I ó What? I didnít know. I did, I didnít know you I ó I would have welcomed you into my home if you had come.îI donít even think I buy this. She didnít want them to come out there because she was gonna go to Delaware to meet with McLean! She didnít want the committee seeing who she was meeting with. This whole thing required her to come to Washington. For this to pull off, she had to come to Washington. So we look at Hillary Clintonís email server investigation and the Trump-Russia collusion, and what do we find? A woman who happens to be helping Blasey Ford defeat Brett Kavanaugh and his nomination to the Supreme Court!With every Democrat saying within minutes of Kavanaugh being nominated theyíre gonna oppose him, with every Democrat saying they believe her even though she doesnít have any evidence, and TIME magazine just put her on the cover, the new cover of TIME magazine. Letís see. Itís an illustration of Blasey Ford last week. Sheís seen taking the oath. Itís pathetic. This whole thing has been a setup, is my point.And the people that set it up are the same people that have been running the silent coup against Donald Trump! And every Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee knows everything I just told you. But rather than it be a problem, theyíre telling themselves how well organized they are and how brilliantly they pulled this off. In their world, theyíve made the American people really believe that this woman was minding her own business one day when she was 15 and this nominee to the court came and brutalized her, and sheís just a woman.(Imitation) ìOh a teacher, that likes children, and thatís terrified to be here, huh.î Theyíre thinking what a masterful plan weíve pulled off. Weíve got everything in this country thinking A that something that didnít happen did, that we have nothing to do with it, when this whole thing is an orchestrated screenplay! And thatís why DiFi wonít turn any of the therapy and the polygraph information for the Judiciary Committee to look at. And the Republicans know this too.But the power of the Democrats is look at the Republicans that are quivering and a little afraid to go ahead and confirm Kavanaugh. This Democrat machine is a scary, scary bunch. Democrat machine includes the media and all of these psychologically deranged protesters that are out there threatening and in some cases committing violence. Weíve got one of them who has just been arrested for ìdoxingî a bunch of Republican senators. Thatís tech lingo for releasing their documents.ìDoxingî means to discover all of their private information, name, address, phone number, bank accounts, all that stuff, and making it public. A guy who interned for Sheila Jackson Lee and I think worked for Feinstein is the guy that did it! And donít forget, Feinstein had a Chinese spy on her staff for a year driving her around. It might be legitimate to ask, was the Chinese spy actually a spy? Let me put it another way: Did Feinstein know that he was a spy and thatís why he was there?I donít know. Iím just telling you, we have been, again, subjected to a gigantic, real life Netflix drama. This thing has been scripted, it has been choreographed, it has been rehearsed! It had an objective that failed. And this is the reason weíre learning all this. The objective was for Kavanaugh to withdraw. They thought that they would get Kavanaugh so intimidated and making him think that all of this was so futile that in order to spare himself this assault, he would withdraw his nomination.Barring that, that Trump would withdraw it so as to spare him the embarrassment. They miscalculated both ways. So now weíve had a procedural vote, weíre gonna have the real Senate confirmation vote tomorrow on a totally manufactured, written, and Iím sure itís been tested, script, with the power players being same people, the FBI, Department of Justice, deep state who helped run the silent coup against the Trumpster. Back to the phones we go.This is Joe in Cincinnati. Itís great to have you, sir. Hi.CALLER: Rush, itís an honor to speak with you. Youíre a patriot, and I salute you.RUSH: Thank you very much, sir. I appreciate that more than you know.CALLER: Iíll be quick. Iím a military service member of 16 years. And after witnessing this Kavanaugh circus, my friends and family say, hey, you should run for political office. After this thereís no way, because being deployed several times, the standard for left would be to accuse me of war crimes. Now, Rush, being a military service member Iím not gonna present a problem without a solution. And hereís the solution.After Supreme Court Justice Kavanaugh gets settled in, he should file slander charges against Swetnick, Ramirez, Ford, and any other activist liberal slanderer or the new standard will be ìguilty until proven innocent.î And I can tell you this right now: My military brothers and sisters have not fought and died for that sort of right for this country.RUSH: Damn right! That is exactly right. I donít think Kavanaugh would be able to sue them. I donít think thatÖ Once you start getting into government, government officials and so forthÖ You get the First Amendment, which protects political speech. And you can produce an ad that says pretty much anything. And they can lie about whoever and whatever you want, and thereís not much you can do about it.The remedy for that is more speech, which in this case equals more money to counter the lies that are being told. Itís a frustrating thing. It drives a lot of average people out of politics even to the point of not voting or not caring ícause they think, ìWhy should I? I donít know whoís telling me the truth. Probably nobody is. I canít keep track of it anyway. Itís not worth the angst that it causes.î It causes a lot of people to tune out. But this is causing people to tune in.I wish there were a remedy for this. ëCause it is all of what you said, slanderous and libelous. But there isnít any recourse. You know, itís the old song, success is the sweetest revenge.  "

Thom Tillis has had some really, really interesting things to say. Several of these senators have mentioned that the FBI has interviewed more than 150 people about Kavanaugh in his seven background investigations ó 150 people ó and not a one of them has corroborated any allegation against him! Thom Tillis just noted that the first background checks of Kavanaugh were done right after he got out of college.Tillis said that the FBI surely would have come across these rape allegations then if there was anything to them. But they havenít corroborated anything. There are thousands of questions that heís answered. Heís undergone a more exhaustive investigation than any Supreme Court nominee, and they canít find diddly-squat on the guy. And then Tillis nuked this whole latest attempt to say that he didnít have the proper judicial temperament last week. Tillis pointed out 31 hours of hearings that he was of perfect temperament until it came time to defend his name against these charges.These Republicans are doing a pretty bang-up job in their presser right now.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Holy smokes out there.

This is John Harwood. John Harwood is a liberal Democrat member of the press. Been at the Wall Street Journal, been at the New York Times, CNBC, wherever heís needed to advance the leftist agenda, Harwood goes. Today he appeared on CNBCís Power Lunch. And this just a little bit of his report about the impact of the Kavanaugh nomination on the midterms elections.HARWOOD: This Kavanaugh nomination controversy has sent an electric charge through the midterm campaign, and right now it appears to be benefiting the Republicans the most. Here in Florida, Bill Nelson, the veteran Democratic incumbent, is leading by just one percentage point in this recent Mason-Dixon poll. Rick Scott, the former health care CEO turned governor of Florida. But if the voters that we talked to about this Kavanaugh nomination are any indication, Rick Scott may get a benefit from angry Republicans who are fired up by this issue.RUSH: I just need to ask if any of you remember who it was whoís been saying all these months that the issues that would decide the midterm elections hadnít happened yet. That would be me back in April, May, June, July, August. Thatís right, Mr. Snerdley. That would be me. Now, here is Harwood. I thinkÖ Folks, I think just based on the way Iím watching liberal reporters talk about this today, Iím getting a sense of a bit of panic setting in.I really believe that they thought that no matter how this Kavanaugh thing went, they would win. I think they thought theyíd persuade people Kavanaugh was a reprobate and if he got confirmed it was really firepower their base that a mugger and a rapist and all this stuffís on the court. If they lost it, ditto, same thing. I think the one thing they didnít count on is rejuvenating and reviving the Republican base they think is happening, they think itís happening. Hereís Harwood. He went out and talked to some voters, and this is that report.MAN #1: Itís such a fraud issue.WOMAN #1: The Kavanaugh hearings are a disgrace.MAN #2: The thing nowadays thereís so many people in the world nowadays, you know, if I come out and say here, youíre ó youíre Joe Smith and ó and you sexually harassed me when I was in high school, youíre guilty, today. Thereís no if ands or buts.MAN #3: I donít think the ó the liberal side, the Democrats are doing themselves any favor with whatís going on right now with this nomination, the Supreme Court nomination. I think itís ó I think itís a sham. Iím disgusted watching it.RUSH: They actually played this on CNBC. Harwood actually went out, he talked to these people, thatís what they said. Can you imagine how shocked the Democrats are and the media is to hear this? This isÖ Iíll tell you another reason why. This is the exact opposite reaction they have been trying to create! The media has been doing everything they can to drum up hatred for Kavanaugh! They have been doing everything they can to try to make average voters think that Brett Kavanaugh is the seediest, biggest gang rapist reprobate thatís ever been nominated to sit on the Supreme Court!They have been trying to make people believe that! And now theyíre getting it thrown right back in their face that thatís not whatís happening. One of the reasons for this is that Kavanaugh is a likable person and that heís been on courts for years! And there have been countless opportunities for all of this to have been discovered and proved, and nobody has ever been able to! A lot of common sense rearing its head here.And itís in direct contravention of the attempts in the reporting by the Drive-By Media to create hatred for this guy among the American people. And when they get stuff thrown back in their face, like our old buddy Nic Robertson, remember went over to Cairo, Tahrir Square talking to natives of Egypt trying to get them to talk about how important Obama was to their freedom movement. And everybody he talked to said, Obama didnít have anything to do with this. Obama? Whatís Obama got to do with it?Nic Robertson was for it. ìAnd there you hear it here in Tahrir Square, Egyptians left and right loved Obama.î None of them said that! In fact, a couple of them he talked to mocked Obama and made fun of him. So when they have this stuff thrown back at them, direct evidence that their attempts to create and shape public opinion are not workingÖ Oh, thereís Heidi Heitkamp. Well, itís a report that sheís gonna vote ìnoî on Kavanaugh, despite the popularity of Kavanaugh in her state.

Why, itís crazy.îWell, the reason thereís only one copy of it is so that it canít get leaked. This is raw data about people, folks. We have gone to great lengths to explain to you what this FBI report is. It is a series of Form 302s. Itís like the FBI version of the form 1040. A 302 is simply the results of an interview with people, people of interest, targets, non-targets neighbors, passersby, irritators, whatever. The FBI goes and talks to people.Theyíve done this about Kavanaugh now seven times, over the course of his judicial career and when he was in the White House, staff secretary to George W. Bush. Heís carrying the nuclear codes in whatís called the football. Heís gotta have top-level security. Heís gotta be worthy of it! Theyíve done background after background after background on Kavanaugh! And they just did another one! And they went and talked to specific witnesses as a result of the claims by Blasey Ford and Ramirez!They talked to Mark Judge, they talked to Ramirez, they talked to a bunch of people. They produced the results of those interviews. They donít tell anybody they think theyíre lying. They donít report their opinions. They donít come to any conclusions! They simply file the 302s and they send íem up to the Senate and the White House. The Senate gets one copy. And you know why that is? Because Obama and Patrick Leahy, who was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee back during one of the Obama terms, agreed to this!The Democrats, the Republicans and Obama agreed that FBI reports like this would be submitted to the Senate only one copy so that senators canít walk out with it and leak it! Theyíre gonna leak it anyway. Thatís already started to happen. And the Democrats know this! This is another example of how they just simply lie. This is not just being disingenuous. Theyíre lying! And theyíre trying to make it look like Trump and Grassley are trying to hide something!And itís not! Itís the law! It is Senate law! Senate rules! With the imprimatur and the agreement of Barack Hussein O. And so now all these Democrat senators are just whining and moaning about the unfairness of it and how hard it is to read it. With only one copy, that means we have to go up in groups and we have to make an appointment. It was the same thing with the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Members of Congress had to make an appointment to go read that entire bill, if you will recall. The point is, thereís no trick being played here.Trump, the Republicans are not trying to limit the Democratsí knowledge of whatís happened here. And the senators like Flake has seen it and Susan Collins, and they have both praised its thoroughness. They have both praised its thoroughness. And Collins has talked about howÖAnd Flake, too, actually, about the fact that itís very thorough in the fact that there isnít any new corroboration! The bottom line is, the FBI looked into this, they talked to specific witnesses as named by Ford and others, and they canít find any evidence for what Ford claims! Or Ramirez! Itís that open and shut! And theyíre livid.I do believe that they thought they could get some witnesses to lie or to, you know, skirt around the edges of things. No, I mean it, folks, I donít trust these people, I donít trust these Democrats to be aboveboard when it comes to a justice on the court that they think is gonna overturn their world. Believe me, this is all about them wanting to be able to continue to kill babes in the womb at their greatest desire. They donít want any limits on this at all. This is what thisÖThey fear theyíre gonna lose this, despite what Kavanaugh has said about overturn Roe v. Wade and all this. This is really what itís about, and the larger thing itís about is the Democrats rely on courts to impose their policies on America when they canít win them legitimately with legislation. So, anyway, thereís nothing untoward here about there only being one copy. Itís Senate rules established back during the Obama administration.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Ari Fleischer with a good point.

Where are the brains of the nation, to focus on a fairly typical high school spree instead of what we can do to help the teens of Chicago stop killing each other?î What we have been watching, writes Ben Stein, ìis the murder of an innocent human being and his family in order to win an election.ìThis is lowering the mighty vaults of power in the District of Columbia until they become trailer trash bars and beauty parlors. God help us if we do not pull ourselves together and focus on whatís important and lasting in human life.î Do you know how many people Iíve heard say a strain of that ó last week, last month, last number of years ó along the lines of: If we donít pull ourselves together, if we donít come together, if we donít unify, if we donít realize whatís real important and focus on that, then God help us? (interruption)No, no, no, I donít disagree with the sentiment, but I think itís futile. Come together with who? Would somebody tell me what there is of what we saw last Thursday or Friday on the Democrat side to ìcome togetherî with? You go to the protest of Kavanaugh right now outside the district court of appeals in Washington. You tell me what there is to come together on. You tell me! Let me tell you one of the reasons why this country is roiled. Iím gonna repeat something. Have you ever wondered why they donít have any abortion protests in the U.K. ó or if they do, I mean, theyíre minor.Theyíre skirmishes. You never hear about them. Itís because abortion became legal in the U.K. in the House of Commons! It was voted on! Everybody had their chance to make case. Do you realize, folks, 80%, if not more, of the liberal agenda that is governing the culture of this country has not passed in our Congress or legislatures? Thatís 80% of the destructive pop culture impulses of the American left have been forced on us by courts ó and that is why, all of this, among many other reasons, is so crucial to the Democrat Party.Because they cannotÖ Look at gay marriage and all these other things. None of that happened in the United States Congress via legislation. There were periphery bills on it, but most all of this stuff ó including other cultural things ó happened because judges either reject legislation to defeat this stuff or they impose their own political views, like Roe v. Wade was imposed in 1973 on the Supreme Court. And because there have not been actual votes, democratic votes on some of these key seminal issues, we are constantly roiled.The Democrats do not want votes on these issues because theyíve not gotten to the point where they would win them ó and if you think they would, take a look at the eight years of Obama. What did Obama do, what did he have to do to get his agenda enacted? Congressional action? No. This one was Obamacare, and that required a bunch of trickery, and there wasnít a single Republican vote for it. Obama got everything he wanted done via executive action and executive order, which is one of the reasons why Trumpís had such ease repealing it.So a majority of people in this country are forced to live in a culture that they reject and yet has not been voted on. Now, you tell me where there is common ground to come together! Itís a wonderful sentiment, and it makes whoever says it sound reasonable and heartfelt. But itís just words, as far as Iím concerned. Anybody can say it. (interruption) No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Snerdley. Donít misunderstand. Iím not criticizing Ben Stein.He just reminded me. ìGod help us if we donít pull ourselves together.î How in the hell is that gonna happen? Do you realize the American left doesnít think but one thing? The only thing wrong in America is that weíre alive, folks. As far as these insane lunatics on the left are concerned, the only problem weíve got is that we are alive and have the ability to oppose them. Now, how do you ìpull ourselves togetherî with that?I donít see how it is possible, which is why I have a constant refrain: They need to be defeated, and that is why Donald Trump is so important, irreplaceable, and valuable. Heís prominent on our side, gets it, understands it, and attempts to do just that: Defeat them. Rather than kowtow to them. Rather than try to make it look like weíre interested in cooperation, crossing the aisle, extending the friendly finger of fickle and fate, hoping against hope that we can come together. Find common ground and once again rediscover our national purpose.Our national purpose is under assault.Our national founding and purpose and objectives is under a blistering attack by a bunch of people I think actually are not completely healthy. Theyíre in bad health, and that bad health is exploited and used by the Democrat Party and the American left, and political issues are made out of psychological disorders. The purpose of all that is revenge and punishment at people the left thinks are standing in their way. Itís normal versus abnormal, if you want to really get down to what this is all about.I need to know where and with whom and how we pull ourselves together with the abnormal. They havenít the slightest interest in it even if people on our side do. So, yeah, itís a nice sentiment. Itís a sweet-sounding sentiment. ìIf we donít pull ourselves together and focus on whatís important and lasting in human life, then weíre gonna go down the theÖî Well, we donít have anything in common, including on whatís important in life!When youíve got whatever percentage of our population has been taught, has been brought up to hate this country and a majority of its citizens ó and then has been taught that the reason theyíre miserable and unhappy is because of a majority of people in this country ó thereís not much else that can explain this kind of explain this kind of rage, temperament, misery, and anger which is constant, and itís never assuaged. They are never happy.No matter what they win or what they get, they are never happy, and there is a human psychological reason for that as well. But the point is, come together? ìIf we donít come togetherÖî Stein is right. I mean, you watch World at War and you find out what we faced? I think weíre at the time where a majority of America has no idea what Omaha Beach was, why it was important. No idea. ìNormandy? Whatís that?îAnd then when they learn, ìAh, thatís old! That doesnít mean anything. Thatís irrelevant! Thatís so long ago. Thatís not the world today.î No, itís only how the United States survived as it is. No, itís so unimportant, itís the only thing that stood in the way of a murderous anti-Semite tyrant from controlling the world. Itís the only thing. Not important, huh? But itís not taught as such. Itís taught as American imperialism, colonialism, or what have you. Iíd love to be able to come together, folks. I just donít see any way to do it.  "

Back between September 8th and 11th in Indiana, Democrat voter enthusiasm was 41%. Itís now down to 39%. In Missouri, September 8 to 11, it was 44% down to 42% now. In Tennessee, Democrat voter enthusiasm was 47% (this is the number of Democrats who are gonna turn out) 47% back in early September, 38% now.Thatís a nine-point drop in Tennessee. On the Republican side, Republican enthusiasm in the same three states is increasing. In Indiana, itís gone from 32% to 41%, in Missouri, 36% to 44%, and in Tennessee, 33 to 44%. So numbers now, 41%-39% Republican, Indiana; 34-42 Republican, Missouri; 44-38 Republican, Tennessee. Thatís a Fox News poll in just three states.One of the people interviewed by the FBI in this most recent report is this Deborah Ramirez. Now, RamirezÖ (sigh) You know what? I canít even remember whatÖ Iím getting her confused. Is she Avenattiís client? (interruption) No. Who is the gang rape? Avenattiís client. (interruption) What was her name? (interruption) Swetnick! Thatís right. This is Ramirez. This isÖ (sigh) Anyway, she was interviewed by the FBI, and the latest Ronan Farrow report further discredits her Kavanaugh allegation.Just to recap. Before she fingered Kavanaugh, Ramirez was telling classmates she could not be certain it was Kavanaugh. She now admits that her drinking that night clouded her memory or whatever it was she alleged Kavanaugh to be doing. Only after six days of talking to her lawyer, a Democrat politician, was Ramirez able to ìrememberî it was Kavanaugh. Every single one of Ramirezís so-called witnesses sides with Kavanaugh.The only so-called corroboration Ramirez had was a guy who heard about the incident from somebody else. That someone else says he has no memory of the incident. Ramirez is a Democrat activist. Wednesdayís New Yorker piece trying to back her up is ìa blatant piece of left-wing activism.î But it ends up that Ronan Farrowís report further discredits her allegation in the end, and she was talked to by FBI. She was one of the people talked to, as was Mark Judge for three hours.The Democrats thought Mark Judge was gonna spill his guts and conÖ (interruption) Mark Judge, right. Was gonna spill his guts and convict Kavanaugh. He didnít, and neither did Ramirez. The FBIÖ So these two people, the FBI talks to íem. These are the people the Democrats wanted! ìMark Judge! Mark Judge! Mark Judge!î they kept saying all last week at the hearing, last Thursday, and then, ìRamirez! Ramirez!îThe FBI talks to íem; they submit the report. Sorry, says the report, but thereís no corroboration here. So Flake looks at it. ìNo corroboration!î Susan Collins looks at it. ìWow. This is really thorough. No corroboration.î A CNN reporter, right before 12 noon today ó reporting on Flake and Collins ó is very distressed, reporting that Flake is once again acting like a Republican, once again sounding like a Republican.

Weíve got until Saturday noon.îNot ìtheyíve got.îìWeíve got.îThe Fox News poll also says Republicans ìare making gains in key Senate races as well.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/04/resident-trumps-pacing-explained-for-senator-sasse/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 4, 2018RUSH: One of the preeminent, most noteworthy Never Trump senators is Ben Sasse of Nebraska.In fact, let me find the Sasse sound bite. I know itís near the end. Grab audio sound bite No. 20. There is an intense competition amongst Never Trumpers in Washington over who will become the next McCain, who will become the next conscience of the Never Trumpers, who will become the next conscience of whatever the Never Trumpers think Trump doesnít have that they do have, that the Republican Party needs to reclaim. And here is what Ben Sasse said last night on the Senate floorÖSASSE: We all know that the president cannot lead us through this time. We know that heís dispositionally unable to restrain his impulse to divide us. His mockery of Dr. Ford last night in Mississippi was wrong. But it doesnít really surprise anyone. Itís who he is.RUSH: Mr. Sasse, Senator Sasse, I have an alternative view, and Iím not gonna presume that youíre listening but maybe somebody who knows you is. I need you to consider something, Senator Sasse. You and numerous others say that President Trump mocked Dr. Ford in his rally, Southaven, Mississippi, earlier this week. Then you suggest that Trump knows what heís doing, despite all the criticism he gets, that he is doing this, itís who he is. He canít help it.Mr. Sasse, I think itís the other way around. I think Trump knows exactly what heís doing. I think Trump has a behavioral pattern, it strategically happens, itís call pacing. And let me briefly explain it again in setting up whatís to come next. When Trump originally spoke about Dr. Ford, what did he say? Compelling testimony, riveting. He couldnít turn away from it. If sheís telling the truth, Kavanaughís gone. Heís got no prayer. If Kavanaughís lied in his testimony, heís gone.Trump said all of this, and everybody said, ìWow. This is really unusual for Trump.î No. Itís not unusual. Trump gets himself on record, not every time, but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approved Washington establishment way. And every time he does it, do not some of you panic? Maybe you donít anymore. But when he first started doing this, like Paris climate accords, yeah, yeah, there may be something here, weíre gonna look at it. No, heís gonna cave, oh, no. Doesnít matter.You can remember countless times where the presidentís initial statement on an issue has seemed to dovetail with what the swamp thinks! But then a few days or a week go by and the president becomes who he is, and he starts speaking out against it after heís put himself on the record. He does this for credibility, and he does it. Itís something called pacing. And it relaxes the opposition in any number of ways. Heís doing the same thing here with Dr. Ford. He knew right off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate, that nobody can prove, that she couldnít prove.And what he did on Monday night was not mock her. He explained to everybody the truth about her. Everybody, because of what Trump did at that rally, everybody was forced to look and listen to that little riff on Dr. Fordís shaky, uncorroborated, unprovable testimony. The Drive-Bys were never gonna tell the truth about Dr. Ford. The Drive-Bys were not able to ignore the rally. They tried. Not even Fox televised Trumpís rally. But because he said what he said about her, he forced the Drive-Bys to cover what he said!In the process, the Drive-Bys reported what he said! And people like Ben Sasse and others started, (imitation), ìGet me the vapors, get me get me the vapors, oh, my God. Trump isÖ This is horrible. This is inhumane. Heís not fit.î What Donald Trump did, recounting the absurd inconsistencies in her testimony, Donald Trump calling her out on everything has been played now on all media. It went all day yesterday, reporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday.The fact is, the Drive-By Media did not report the inaccuracies of Dr. Fordís testimony. The Drive-By Media did not report on none of the corroboration being possible! They did not tell their audiences that the four people Ford placed in the room when her incident happened claimed they werenít there! Nobody knew that, folks! Other than you, the people that watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr. Ford couldnít back up what she was saying!The people that watched the mainstream media had no idea that the four witnesses Ford claims were there all deny it and donít remember being there! And one of them was one of her good friends! The Drive-Bys were not reporting any of that! The Drive-Bys were reporting what the Democrat senators, (imitation), ìI believe her. She is a credible witness.î As far as the American people who watch only mainstream mediaís concerned, the woman was telling the truth, they had backup, she had corroboration, and Kavanaugh was guilty!So Trump goes out, tells the truth about her, she doesnít know what, she doesnít know when, she doesnít know where, she doesnít know how she got home, sheÖ Gets it on the record, the Drive-Bys have to report it and for the first time in their lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard it! Look at it this way. Think of the millions of people who had never heard the truth about Dr. Christine Ford and her full-of-holes testimony. Think of the millions whoíd never heard it until Trump went out and characterized it for everybody.Think of it this way. Think of the thousands of voters in Missouri, in Arizona, in Michigan and Maine and West Virginia, North Dakota, Alaska, who now know the truth, who never would have known the truth had Trump not detailed it for people in his rally! Collins, Manchin, Heitkamp, McCaskill, Flake, Murkowski, they knew that there was no corroboration. They knew that there couldnít have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses. This is why Trump did it.This is why Trump does what he does. If we had an honest media, millions of people would already know that Dr. Fordís story doesnít add up! If the media ever told the truth about this, there wouldnít be any protests today, or not nearly as large and voluminous. The people at these protests think sheís telling the Godís truth. They think itís gospel. They donít know that her story canít be backed up. Their media hasnít told íem. The Democrat senators havenít told íem. Only Trump did. Another reason why they hate him.But we donít have an honest media. And so millions of people had no idea of all the holes in the Christine Blasey Ford story. Now they do. And hereís a little cherry on top. Since Trump did that and the whole media reported on it and Democrat senators and the like were asked about it, what comes three days later? Todayís FBI report saying no corroboration for what Dr. Ford said. So Trump says it, people like Ben Sasse and other Never Trumpers go literally insane.But if Trump hadnít said it, nobody would know it, but Trump did say it. Millions now do know it, and here comes the cherry on the top, the FBI report. We couldnít find any corroboration for her story. End of the week, Trump was right! Drive-By Media wrong! Democrat senators wrong! Ben Sasse wrong! And Trump doesnít do this accidentally. Itís not like heís lucky and stumbles into this stuff. This is Trumpís strategy, and itís all related to the pacing of how he originally or initially, eventually, I should say, gets to his real thoughts on any issue.  "

Great to have you.CALLER: Hey, Rush. Mega dittos from a lifelong listener. Iíve been listening to you for 30 years. I just want to thank you for everything you do for the country and especially your leukemia-and-lymphoma-a-thon that you do once a year. Itís fantastic. It means a lot to me.RUSH: Thank you, sir.CALLER: My question is, what do you think is going on with the Mueller probe? ëCause itís sure gotten quiet.RUSH: Well, itís an interesting question. Whatís going on with the Mueller probe? The latest Iíve heard of the Mueller probe, the story actually has a sentence in it (paraphrased), ìThe special counselís office of Robert Mueller III, Esquire, most honest man in Washington, is shedding prosecutors.î Shedding prosecutors! Now, when your cat or dog sheds, it means theyíre losing hair. Mueller is losing prosecutors. Meaning the jobís almost done.Theyíre moving away. Theyíre going off to other things. Thereís less and less for his team of Trump haters to do. Iíll just repeat what I said at the very opening of the program. I donít think this tax story would have run today if Mueller were still hot on the trail and had something, and if the Ford story werenít beginning to unravel. The New York Times story wouldnít have run. When I saw on Drudge this massive New York Times story, my first reactionÖRemember, folks, I am a student of the media and the left, and nothing happens by accident. The Times didnít just finish the story by deadline last night, thereby making it able to be published. Theyíve been holding it! Theyíve been working on it for a year. Theyíve been coordinating with the Showtime network. Theyíve been producing a documentary for the past year documenting how the Times found it, how they reported it, how they prepped it, how they wrote it.The fact that this thing was released and published last night for today? The first reaction I had was, ìThe Kavanaugh thing must really be unraveling, ícause itís time now to turn attention to Trump from a new angle,î and itís not really new. Itís taxes. The latest newsÖ Correct me on this, Mr. Snerdley, if youíve seen something more recent. But the last story I saw on this is that MuellerÖ (chuckling) I donít know what to believe anymore.Mueller is showing various people Roger Stone emails and texts and asking them what they know about it. Weíre down now to Roger Stone in an investigation that started with everybody thinking Trump cheated with Russia and that Mueller was the guy that was gonna find it ó and when we got Trumpís tax returns (impression), ìWe were gonna see that itís Putin that enabled Trump to hold on to his money and get more of it. Trumpís wealth is directly tied to illicit activity with Russia.îWell, there isnít any Russian anything in the New York Times story. So weíre getting down to the nitty-gritty here. You know, ethics say that a special counsel should not write and release a report within this close proximity to an election because of the impact that it would have ó and they, of course, are unbiased and totally objective in the Justice Department and theyíre not about affecting the outcome of elections. Ha-ha-ha-ha.Which is all theyíve been trying to do for two years. I wouldnít be surprised if they release a report, you know, a couple days before the election which excoriates Trump for irresponsibility, excoriates him for a bad attitude, excoriates him for having really, really shady friends and all that but doesnít accuse him of anything.If itís not supposed to happen before the election, thatís when it probably will happen, is the way these people operate. But maybe it wonít. Outside of that, Iím like everybody else. I donít know what Mueller has. I donít know what heís gonna reveal. I donít know what heís gonna report. Zip, zero, nada. All I know is that the Drive-By Media decided to try to make something else a bigger story today than the Kavanaugh story.  "

I donít believe sheís minding her own business one day and she gets a letter from a constituent who said, ìI donít want to be known, I donít want to be named, and I donít want this taken any further.îWell, thatÖ (chuckles) It just doesnít make any sense. Unless you put it in the proper context of what the express purpose of this is, which I happen to believe is forcing Kavanaugh to resign, to withdraw, or for Trump to withdraw. I think this is beginning to unravel because Trump and Kavanaugh have hung in ó and by unravel, I mean be exposed for the phoniness that much of it is. Anyway, Susie, Iím glad you called. Thank you. Thank you very much.  "

I really, really, really appreciate your waiting. Thank you.CALLER: Thanks, Rush. I just wanted to say that Kavanaugh is the scapegoat for all of the women who have been sexually assaulted but were afraid or embarrassed to report it.RUSH: WellÖ (sigh) You may have a point. I think youíre right in line with one of my newfound theories, and itís actually not a newfound theory. What it is is a very late arrival on my part of being able to verbalize it. Youíve heard over the years, ìLiberalismís a mental disease,î and there are all kinds of people have said that, and I thought, ìThatís too simplistic, and besides, itís not effective. Even if itís true, itís not gonna be effective to say that.îBut that doesnít erase the fact that weíre dealing with some genuine, incomprehensible emotional problems on the part of these people, and I have to give credit where credit is due. It was a little blurb by Jim Geraghty at National Review that caused the explosion of brain synapses in the frontal lobe here. He saidÖ Iím paraphrasing; I donít have it right in front of me. But he said, ìI donít even think this is what it is.îHe said, ìI think psychological disorders, people with psychological disorders have become liberals in politics, that psychological disordersÖ People who have them, have brought their disorders into politics ó and rather than just a singular thing that happened to them, they make it all about the country did it to them or an entire population did it to them,î and I think thatís exactly what liberalism is and has become, and thatís where we agree.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Folks, here is the Jim Geraghty quote from National Review. ìThe more time I spend covering politics, the more Iím convinced that a significant chunk of grassroots political activists arenít really arguing about politics at all. These folks are actually grappling with personal psychological issues and projecting it onto the world of politics.îBingo!Iíve been searching for that description for years! I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together. Itís one of the rare moments I was unable to. This is exactly right! Weíre dealing with people who have suffered some kind of psychological disorder; theyíve turned to politics for the solution ó or the revenge is actually what theyíre looking for ó and they donít just want revenge against whoever did whatever to them.They are now demanding that every representative of the group that the individual that did something to them belongs to be made to pay a price for it. Itís what theÖ Well, the #MeToo, in large part, was never bipartisan. It was thought to be, said to be, but it never was. Okay, even if it was, itís been co-opted by the Democrat Party. Look at the Occupy Wall Street movement or look at Black Lives Matter. Take any left-wing group that you want.Itís made up of people who for some reason think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody, and instead of dealing with that in their lives, they enter politics, and they demand that the Democrat Party take up their cause. The Democrat Party willingly has. The Democrat Party has become the party of all of these disparate constituency groups with their singular causes.Because the Democrat Party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America, that America is responsible for what happened these people! That capitalism is responsible! That the power structure, that the founding is responsible. So people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy, and then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts.And they become political movements, and then they become victims ó and that, of course, allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives. And then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you. I contend to you that most people on our side have no idea how to deal with this. No idea whatsoever. So we end up in debates about (chuckles) boys who want to pretend to be girls so they can go in girlsí bathrooms, and it becomes legitimate.Itís sick in many instances. Not that specifically, but just the whole concept of what is happening here. It is a violent, bullying, intimidating movement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate, various agendas ó and the target is America. The target is America, as founded. The target is American capitalism. So when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand-in for men who have abused every woman out there, heís right.Blasey Ford will end up being supported by other women whoíve been abused. Whether sheís telling the truth or not, it doesnít matter! Because it did happen to them. These women we donít know that are out there watching this, it did happen to them ó and by God, somebodyís gonna pay for it. In this case, itíd be Kavanaugh. Thatís how theyíre gonna be heard, rather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them.Itís the same thing, I think, with Black Lives Matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem. ìAll cops are bad. Every white cop is a racist. Every black convict is innocent.î Every instance here points to the country at large as being responsible, in unfairness, in bias, in discrimination, in racism, all of this. The Democrat Party is the organizing party, the collection agency for all of these complaints. The Democrat Partyís happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one.The Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that theyíll fix it ó and they never do. They never do! The rage and the anger never ends. It only gets worse because the Democrats donít fix anything ó and finally, it doesnít even depend upon being fixed. It just means, ìSomebodyís gotta pay! In this case, Kavanaugh! Heís gonna pay, whether he did it or not.î  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/03/trump-didnt-mock-ford-he-told-the-truth/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 3, 2018RUSH: So the FBI probe of Kavanaugh is expected to wrap up very soon. I asked Snerdley today, ìAre you worried about this? These are the FBI. These are the people that tried to screw Trump. These are the people that ran the coup, silent coup, working with people in the DOJ.î Now, many of those FBI people are gone, like Strzok Smirk and Page, McCabe, Comey, and so on. By the way, did I see something about Comey is refusing a request to testify about something and theyíre gonna have to subpoena him?I just saw a graphic on TV about that. Weíre overloaded here today, folks. Itís requiring every talent I have to keep some semblance of organization, ícause things keep popping. You get the show prepared and the show starts and half of itís irrelevant. But we do our best each and every day to make it all make sense once the entire presentation is completed.ìFBI Probe of Kavanaugh Is Expected to Wrap up Very Soon ó People familiar with the process saidÖî This is a Wall Street Journal story. Then, after that, there are stories that say the only people that will see it are senators. McConnell said the only people that are gonna see this report are senators. Remember what the FBI report is. It doesnít have any conclusions in it. Well, it isnít supposed to. Itís just a series of 302s. Those are theÖItís like a 1040, 1040-ES with the IRS. A 302 is simply an interview form, and the FBI goes out and talks to people and reports what they say, might compare it with previous statements and turn it over to whoever asked for all this ó in this case, the Senate Judiciary Committee ó and then they form conclusions based on it. Now, when McConnell says that the only people gonna see it are senators, itís guaranteed, therefore, to leak.And depending on what it says or what the conclusion to all this is will have a lot to say about who ultimately leaked this. McConnell continues to depending on to be adamant thereís gonna vote. Heís saying no matter what you people try to intimidate our senators, gonna work. Weíre gonna have a vote on Kavanaugh. (Ostensibly on Friday.)ìLawyers for Christine Blasey Ford Say That Their Client Hasnít Been Interviewed,î and theyíre desperate. They want the FBI to interview her. Well, Iím sorry, but thatís not what this is. It says right here, ìFBI probe of Kavanaugh,î and that may be one of the things thatís wrong here. But itís not an investigation of Blasey Ford, itís an investigation of Kavanaugh, and the FBIís already done it six times! This is the seventh! Thereís not an official investigation into her.Sheís the accuser. Sheís above reproach, donít you know. This is theÖ Weíre so out of balance here. Women ó activist feminazi women ó can demand all kinds of investigations into men. Men cannot require or demand investigations into women. Can you imagine if somebody tried that? I mean, women as an entire gender population of the country? Men are under investigation in this country, be it through Kavanaugh or through Trump or whoever.Now, letís get to Trump mocking (this is TheHill.com) Christine Blasey Ford. Let me look at the audio sound bites here. Yeah, grab sound bite Nos. 5 and 6. This is what the left is really irritated about today. Last night in Southaven, MississippiÖ This is a suburb of Memphis. It just barely over the Tennessee-Mississippi state line, and here is Trump. This is at another make America again rally, ìMake America Great Again.îTHE PRESIDENT: Howíd you get home? ìI donít remember.î Howíd you get there? ìI donít remember.î Where is the place? ìI donít remember.îAUDIENCE: (laughter and applause)THE PRESIDENT: How many years ago was it? ìI donít know. I donít know. I donít know! I donít know!îAUDIENCE: (roaring applause)THE PRESIDENT: What neighborhood was it in? ìI donít know.î Whereís the house? ìI donít know.î Upstairs? Downstairs? Where was it? ìI donít know, but I had one beer. Thatís the only thing I remember,î and a manís life is in tatters. A manís life is shattered.RUSH: Now, that is not mocking Ford. Mocking would have been to impersonate her. He didnít do that. See, this is whatís wrong. Donald Trump simply voiced what no Republican senator would have. These are the questions she should have been asked last Thursday by Republican senators! Her timeline should have been challenged! Her allegations should have been challenged! But they werenít! The Democrats werenít going to. The Democrats announced her and stated her to be credible. ìSheís above and beyond reproach!ìYou cannot challenge her! She is the accuser!î So the Republicans, they played right along and went out and had Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions ó which now turn out to be brilliant, but at the time we were all kind of curious, you know, what the purpose was. All Trump is doing is reminding everybody what she said. She doesnít know! She doesnít know! The people she says were there say they werenít there!This is not mocking her, and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country. An accuser comes forward, and you canít poke holes in obvious places? You canít point out obvious discrepancies? You cannot reference or make mention of the differences in her story, depending on the day sheís telling it? Whatever this is, it is not mocking Christine Blasey Ford! Now, a lot of people are saying, ìBut this is crazy, Rush, because last week Trump was saying that she was ëcredibleí and her testimony was ëcompelling.'îI have explained this before and Iím going to explain it again. Trump always eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything, and he may not do that out of the batterís box. I have a name for this. I call it ìpacing.î Trump will initially go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the DREAMers ó or in this case Dr. Blasey Ford, heíll call her credible testimony compelling. Heíll even go so far as to say (summarized), ìYeah, if sheís telling the truth, yeah, then my nomination might be in trouble. Yeah. Iíll agree with that.îThat gives him credibility. It makes people kind of cock their heads. They donít think Trump can be that fair. Iím talking about the media and the left, the Democrats. They donít think Trump can be that reasonable. But he does it to them every time. It gives him the credibility to later be critical and to step away. He said, ìYeah, I found her credible. I found her compelling.î Then, as we learn more, and then as events play out, Trump is able to parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on what is not a knee-jerk reaction.If Trump were to have said initially what he said last night at the rally, why, there would have been hell to pay. But now he can back it up. Now thereís all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesnít make any sense. Weíve got an ex-boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and has taught people how to beat them! We have people challenging her account. We didnít have that last week. It is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did.It gives him the credibility later to be critical and to step away. Itís a common technique he uses. He does it on everything. Itís why Iíve always told you: Donít take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that heís caving or flipping. You people, Iím sure you remember there have been many instances (in fact, I may have fallen for one myself; thatís how I learned) that Trump will tweet something or say something it will make you look like heís aboutÖBefore he pulled out of the Paris climate accords, what did he say? ìClimate change a very serious thing, and we have to look at it, and we are looking at it, and weíll do the right thing.î Oh, so heís on record as being open about it! And then later on when heís learned what he needs to learn, comes out and tells you what he thinks, really thinks. Itís a pattern. Itís a technique. Itís a Trump-developedÖI donít even know if he developed it or itís just how he does it naturally and instinctively. But I call it ìpacing.î Now, Republicans have not built up this reputation. Senate Republicans havenít; Trump has. Trump has established that after he makes an initial statement on something, he can make fun of things ó and what really irritates the left is he gets away with it. I cannot tell you how it irritates them. See, he shouldnít have survived the Access Hollywood video.See, he shouldnít have survived anything theyíve thrown at him. The fact that he has and has continued to prosper and the triumph, I cannot tell you how blindly insane it has made them with rage. Other Republicans have not developed the gonads to do this and pull it off. Trump has been attacked so much, weíre nowÖ If you go back to 2015 when this campaign startedÖ This is 2018. This is three years ó in fact, itís three years and three months. Trump gets in in June of 2015.Trump has been attacked so much, he doesnít care anymore. It doesnít bother him anymore, is my point. Heís now willing to take the arrows. Heís willing to take the hits for everybody else. Thatís why he is needed, folks. He is willing to do what he did last night. I know. Murkowski and Collins are shuddering and cowering in the corner with the vapors. ìOh, my God. It was so horrible. It was so horrible!î It wasnít horrible. Everything he said is true! He was not mocking her! The actress whose audio we played mocked Blasey Ford. Trump didnít.He just simply pointed out she kept back up, she cannot corroborate. There isnít any corroboration for what she said. Why is that not relevant? Why does that not matter? Why have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accuse any man of anything and itís gospel, and then be joined by a so-called movement called #MeToo where all women can join it. Can you imagine if there was something going onÖ? Can you imagine if men organized for the express purpose of destroying women?You canít even imagine it, can you?You canít even imagine, organized movement, the male version of #MeToo. ìWell, Rush, I mean, women are not out there sexually abusingÖî Well, yeah, that does happen, but thatís not the point. This is not aboutÖ Even Bannon said it. This is not just about sexual abuse. This is about raw power. This is about female rage because of things that have happened to them, the leftist women, and they have organized all of these disorders into a giant political movement.Iím just asking you to think. Can you everÖ? Can you envision a movement of men? If such a group existed and Oprah had invited the leader on her show, heíd have been thrown off in the first 10 minutes and been ridiculed and made fun of for the rest of his life. It could not happen! Women are a minority, supposedly, even though theyíre not, in numbers. But itís so out of balance. All Trump did was say what everybody following this knows.Even the Democrats. The Democrats know there are all kinds of holes in her story. Trump doing what heís doing provides a lot of cover for a lot of people. Thatís one of the many reasons why heís needed. Trump said, ìGuilty until proven innocent. Thatís very dangerous for our country.î Thatís what this is. Thatís what the Democrat Party is ensuring, and thatís what Democrat senators have said! That the accused has to prove he didnít do it, that the accuser doesnít have to corroborate anything, the accuser doesnít have to prove anything.Where? In what civilized society is that real? Trump said, ìGuilty until proven innocent. Thatís very dangerous for our country. I have it myself all the time. But for me, itís like part of the job description. Let it happen to me. It shouldnít happen to him,î meaning Kavanaugh. Translation: ìIíll take the hits. I will take the arrows. I will stand in the way of bullets and Iíll take íem for the team.îBREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, Sarah Sanders, White House press briefing is going on. She just laid into the press, and she said exactly what I said, if I donít mind saying so.She said Trump didnít mock anybody last night. He simply recited the facts! And he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats. Theyíre to blame for this. None of this needed have happened in public. They had Blasey Fordís email or letter way back in July. They could have done everything thatís been done to investigate her claim off record, behind the scenes, nobody knowing about it.But they didnít do that. They waited to use it as a Hail Mary. She disputes the idea that Trump mocked. She said, ìAll he was doing was reciting the facts.î Here it is again. This is what the press, the media, everybody is out now ripping Trump, claiming that he mocked Christine Blasey Ford.THE PRESIDENT: Howíd you get home? ìI donít remember.î Howíd you get there? ìI donít remember.î Where is the place? ìI donít remember.îAUDIENCE: (laughter and applause)THE PRESIDENT: How many years ago was it? ìI donít know. I donít know. I donít know! I donít know!îAUDIENCE: (roaring applause)THE PRESIDENT: What neighborhood was it in? ìI donít know.î Whereís the house? ìI donít know.î Upstairs? Downstairs? Where was it? ìI donít know, but I had one beer. Thatís the only thing I remember,î and a manís life is in tatters. A manís life is shattered.RUSH: That is the point! Christine Ford is fine! Christine Ford is absolutely fine, despite how she acts! Kavanaughís life is shattered, ruined. His wife, his family, his past, his present, his future, destroyed! They donít care. Sheldon WhitehouseÖ Iím sorry. Not Sheldon. Senator Kennedy from Louisiana? This guy is a walking sound bite. This guyís out there; heís saying things like (paraphrased), ìSome Democrats have no soul.ìTheir mothers must not have breast-fed them. They donít care who gets destroyed! Dr. Ford, her confidentiality, her family. They donít care if Kavanaugh gets destroyed.î This is John Kennedy, Republican, U.S. senator from Louisiana. Some of my colleagues on the Democrat side are in good faith. Some Iím convinced donít even have a soul.ìTheir mothers didnít breast-feed them. They didnít have to. They went to raw meat. They went right to raw meat. They donít care who gets destroyed, Dr. Ford or her confidentiality, her family. They donít care if Kavanaugh gets destroyed or his reputation.î Anyway, Senator Kennedy said, ìWhat I am hearing from voters in Louisiana is enough is enough.î Right on cue from American greatness: ìDem[ocrat]s Risk Losing Suburban Women with Kavanaugh Attacks,î by Julie Kelly.ìI am not a crier. One of my best friends teases me that Satan cries more than I do; my husband jokes about my ësix-second cryí when I finally shed some tears. But as I watched Brett Kavanaughís opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday, I cried ó and for more than six seconds. I wept for him, for his crushed wife seated behind him, for his young daughters, and for his friends. I cried for our country.ìIt was an emotional release of sympathy, frustration and rage. I wasnít alone. Several of my friends admitted they had the same reaction. Ö Mollie Hemingway mirrored the feelings of millions of women when she choked up that evening during an interview with Tucker Carlson on Fox News: ëI was sobbing when I was watching it,í Hemingway said. ëI heard that a lot from people as well. It was hard just to watch those clips here.í ÖìThe Democratsí insistence that due process and a presumption of innocence donít apply to men (particularly conservative white men) is a terrifying prospect for the husbands, sons, fathers, and brothers [women] love.î The abject insistence on denial of due process, denial of presumption of innocence. Trump I laid it out! She cannot confirm what she said! She has holes throughout all of it. Yet she is said to be eminently credible, and we canít challenge it.So Trump does. Iím telling you, folks, youíd better be thankful. If Trump hadnít done it, you wouldnít be hearing it anywhere but here and elsewhere in conservative media ó and donít think that suburban women all across America arenít seeing the same thing. They are. Hereís more Trump from the rally in Southaven, Mississippi, last night. Here. He took a shot at Swetnick and that lawyer, Avenatti.THE PRESIDENT: We had another woman just reported by a sleazebag lawyer named Avenatti.AUDIENCE: (booing)THE PRESIDENT: Sleazebag! Sleazebag! Well, it turned out even NBC ó whoís as bad as they get. Even NBC couldnít shield her with that interview. Did you see that interview? This woman had no clue what was going on.RUSH: Sarah Sanders is saying to the press at the briefing that every bit of evidence theyíve seen so far supportís Kavanaughís case (and it does).BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So Rambo Blumenthal is out there attacking Trump and his vile attack on Dr. Ford. They called him Da Nang Dick. This is the guy who lied for many years about serving with bravery and honor in Vietnam when he had never, ever, been there. He literally claimed that people were dying all around him but he and his platoon kept doing their job. He was never there! The guyís a sicko! Heís a pathological liar! He got called out on it!The people of Connecticut still elected the guy! He used to be the attorney general of the state, now heís a senator. I call him Rambo, Rambo Blumenthal. I wish he would just sit in his office and play with his GI Joe dolls and be quiet. But no, heís out there claiming that Trumpís vile attack on Dr. Ford disrespected ìthe entire survivor community.î We have a survivor community now. A survivor of men community now. Itís on CNN, and here it is.ìEven the Connecticut senator who himself has been the target of attacks from TrumpÖî The target of attacks from Trump? The guy was a flat-out liar! What do you mean, ìthe target of attacks from Trumpî? Trump didnít attack anybody! He told everybody who the guy is! Here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now, exactly as I said. She got a question from John Roberts, and it was all about (imitation), ìDo you think that maybe the president shouldnít have done it mocking her like that because it gets to Collins and Murkowski and it may affect the way they vote. Itís horrible. Do you think the president maybe should have not done it?îSANDERS: The president was stating the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchellís report. He was stating facts that were given during Dr. Fordís testimony. And the Senate has to make a decision based on those facts and whether or not they see Judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court. Every single word Judge Kavanaugh has said has been picked apart, every single word, second by second of his testimony has been picked apart. Yet if anybody says anything about the accusations that have been thrown against them, thatís totally off-limits and outrageous.RUSH: Exactly right! You canít challenge her! So Trump did, for everybody else who doesnít have the gonads to do it! Trump did it! And, yeah, heís providing a little shade for some of these people to hide under. And Iíll guarantee you, they may be publicly saying I wish he hadnít done it, thatís outrageous what Trump did. Theyíre thanking everybody he did it privately. Somebody has to say it. Itís the freaking truth!  "

I mean, NBC has been putting things out there that nobody can find any evidence of, and now theyíre backtracking and trying to cover their rear ends.This is funny. You know, Avenattiís caseÖ Heís the lawyer for Swetnick, who claims that Kavanaugh is running gang rapes. That has been totally nuked, and Avenatti has not produced any evidence, documentation requested by the Judiciary Committee. He hounds them all the time. So theyíve responded and they say, ìOkay, well, send us what weíre looking for here. Weíll look into it.î He doesnít send them anything. So his last communication to Mike Davis ó whoís the chief lawyer for nominations of the Judiciary Committee.Avenatti sends him a letter, ìMr. Davis, stop playing games. If youíre the chief counsel, then you need to do your job. Please respond to our requests.î Davis wrote back, ìMr. Avenatti, weíve already reviewed your clientís allegations. We focus on credible allegations. Please stop emailing me.î This whole thing has been a setup, and the Democrat Party is in on it. Various special interest groups of the left are in on this.The setup is now continuing. First off, grab sound bite 31. Lindsey Graham, in Washington today at the Atlantic Magazine Festival. (Boy, is that a festival youíd like to go to, some magazine festival? Iím sure thereís lots of wine and cheese.) The editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg is interviewing Lindsey Graham. Question: ìWhat would you say to the president about his performance last night where he disparaged Dr. Ford?îGRAHAM: Everything he said was factual. Heís frustrated his nominee has been treated so badly óGOLDBERG: Factual! Is a personal, degrading attack óGRAHAM: Yeah, well, you know óGOLDBERG: ó on someone whoís a private citizen!GRAHAM: You know, hereís whatís personally degrading: ìThis is what you get when you go through a trailer park with a hundred-dollar bill.îAUDIENCE: (grumbling)GRHAM: This is not the first time this has happened.GOLDBERG: That was actually a reference to something somebody said.GRAHAM: [Bill Clinton strategist] James Carville. See, most of yíall are too young to remember this. The bottom line is: I know what can happen to a woman who comes forward in a political environment.RUSH: Now, Grahamís point is that thereís a lot of young people in this audience that donít remember the Clinton years in 1992 when James Carville was trying to destroy Paula Jones. (impression) ìEh, you never know what youíre get when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park! What youíre gonna come up with, uh, is women like this who hassle our greatest president on earth, Bill Clinton.îHillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women, and Lindsey Graham was referred that. But these people in the audience didnít know it. They thought he was talking about Ford, and thatís when he stopped and said, ìAh, ah, ah. See? Thatís actually a reference to something somebody said, James Carville. Most of you all are too young to remember this.î So not only do they live in denial that it ever happened.Now theyíre trying to shut down anybody who brings it up. You know, the Clinton years and what they did to women supposed to go down the memory hole. Now I have a transcript. An anti-Kavanaugh protester confronted a Republican senator, and he pushed back. This was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall. Anti-Kavanaugh protesters have flooded Capitol Hill, and theyíve been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices in Senate office building!How does that happen? But what we all know how it happens, but theyíre there. One of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through Senate building walkway Monday. And she said, ìWhy are you supporting Kavanaugh? Why are you supporting Kavanaugh?î Cassidy did not ignore her. He took the chance to push back. He asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges.Cassidy: ìWhy wouldnít I support Kavanaugh?îProtester: ìBecause rapists are bad.îCassidy: ìWait a second. Everybody there said it didnít happen; he didnít rape anybody. So why am I gonnaÖ?îProtester: So youíre gonnaÖ? So youíre gonna believe Mark Judge over a woman?Cassidy: No. Iím going to believe her best friend who says it didnít happen. She wasnít there.Protester: Her best friend didnít say it didnít happen. Her best friend said she wasnít told about it.Cassidy: Her best friend said she didnít remember it.Protester: So youíre okay, as a doctor, to harm a woman?Cassidy: Wait a second. Are you okay as a person to go ahead and to accept a non-corroborated charge to destroy somebodyís life? If it destroyed your life, your son life or your husband ó ?Protester: Silence.Cassidy: Wait a second. Answer my question. If it was your husband, your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated, would you like that?Protester: I would support a full FBI investigation.RUSH: Weíre dealing with programmed robots. Iím glad Cassidy pushed back, but itís a lost cause on the protester. The protester is not even hearing what he says. Sheís got programmed answers bought and paid for by George Soros, and she hears keywords in what he says, knee-jerk reaction causing things and replies accordingly.Cassidy says, ìNo, no. Would you like an uncorroborated charge to destroyÖ?îìI wouldnít marry somebody that was a drunk,î said the protester.ìOh, no. Wait a minute. Uncorroborated.! Answer the question. I donít think youíre able to. Because you know itís unfair.îProtester: ìI would stand up.îCassidy: ìYou know itís unfair.îProtester: ìI would fight and I would make sure women are heard. Clearly youíre okay if a rapist goes on Supreme Court.îCassidy: ìNo, Iím not. But then, on the other hand, clearly youíre okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing to you.îProtester: ìNo, there is evidence. Look at the standard. How many people are in jail for less?îRUSH: So what thisÖ Unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript of something else and helps people understand it, itís a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if youíre trying to persuade them. You canít persuade them, just like you canít persuade the media. You know, Iíve told the story when I was first at this ó very young, wet behind the ears, naÔve ó and the media would want to talk to me. I thought they were very interested.I knew nobodyís ever heard of me. The radio showís taking off. I thought they were legitimately curious and thatís how I went into early interviews, and found out thatís not at all what it is. They werenít curious about anything. They were simply there to discredit me, make fun of me, to raise doubts. It took me longer than I want to admit to figure this out. You cannot persuade these people. You canít change their minds in debate. Itís why I say the only option is to defeat them politically, and thatís happening.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Bill on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Great to have you, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Rush. A delight to talk to you. The problem with all of this is I donít think anybodyís gonna be punished for it, least of all Dr. Ford, who is a serial perjurer, as you suggested earlier. But I think there is one person who ought to be in the crosshairs, and that is the president of the American Bar Association. Iím looking at an editorial that appeared in the Wall Street Journal September 29th entitled, ìAnother Kavanaugh Flakeout.îIt talks about Robert Carlson, the ABA president, who, right after the hearings, sent a very misleading letter to the Senate suggesting that they need an FBI investigation and that there must, must, must be a delay in the confirmation. And this Robert Carlson gave this impression and it was coming as an official document of the American Bar Association, which gave its highest uncompromising positive rating of Brett Kavanaugh, but it didnít. It turns out that this Robert Carlson, the ABA president, consulted no one there óRUSH: Right. Exactly.CALLER: ó anyone and didnít even ask the committee responsible for judicial recommendations.RUSH: Thatís exactly right. Iím sorry to interrupt you, but weíre down to it on time, and I want to buttress your point. He sent a personal letter made to look like the whole ABA was reneging on their referral of Kavanaugh. Youíre exactly right. Youíre also right that nobody here is gonna be punished. Nobody ever is in the swamp! Thatís one of the things that has people irritated. No matter whatís learned, no matter whatís exposed, nobody gets held accountable for any of it. And itís damn frustrating for a lot of people.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/03/whats-missing-from-the-new-york-times-story-on-trumps-taxes/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 3, 2018RUSH: Thereís a big lack of a reveal in the New York Times tax story on Trump. The New York Times did a yearlong investigation of Trumpís taxes. Now, I donít know where they got the returns. Itís illegal that they have them. Obviously, somebody at the IRS doesnít care. I mean, the left has infiltrated everything, so obviously thatís how this happened. Doesnít matter. Once the Times has them, thatís that. But it had íem now for a year.Note when the story runs. They ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story, right? This is something, ideally, youíd want to wait until closer to the election. You want to maybe wait a couple of weeks. But, no, they ran this thing yesterday. And now thereís a companion Showtime network documentary on this. So thereís been some collaboration (you might even say some collusion) on this. Why cover up the Kavanaugh story with this?This is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks. ìWhat to do? What to do? We got Trump out thereÖî They claim heís mocking Blasey Ford. He wasnít mocking her. Look, I understand Republican senators saying what theyíre saying. ìOh, my God. This is unacceptable. I donít know why the president did it!î He did it for some reason. Everybodyís pointing out that Trump, just last week, was saying she was very credible.Yeah, he did, and we knew when he said that why he said it. He had to! Everybody has to. Before all this is investigated and put to bed, you canít run out there and start ripping on her. Even if itís deserved, even if itís warranted, last week you could not rip on Christine Blasey Ford. There was nothingÖ Thereís no upside to doing it, no matter if you were right. Even if she was lying through her teeth and you could demonstrate it, last week was not the time to do it.So Trump joins the chorus, ìI find her compelling. I find her very credible.î Well, now sheís not so credible. (She never was.) But now sheís not so credible. Thereís all kinds of holes, and Trump just pointed íem out. All Trump did is point out the flaws in her story, which should have happened during the hearings last Thursday. But the Republicans were not gonna go there. They were not gonna challenge her because it just wasnít smart.Especially with that voice that she was affecting, to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didnít believe her, would have not been politically useful. But in a normal congressional hearing, committee hearing, her allegations would be challenged and tested. They were not. Thatís all Trump did! Trump pointed out the mistakes or the lies or the differences, the prevarications.She canít remember where, when, who. The people she says were there say they werenít. Thatís all he did. Republican senators should have done that last week, but they couldnít. So Trumpís given íem cover, Trumpís providing shade for íem, and let them go out and rip him for doing it if they want. He understands that. By this time, we have to assume Trump knows what heís doing. When he goes off-script, he doesnít step in it. It may look like it, but he doesnít.But thatís not the big take-away. The big take-away for me is this. One year, the New York Times has been investigating the Trumpster for 40 years. Theyíve got tax returns going back who knows how long, and guess whatís not part of the story? Guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump? Guess what one word you do not see in the report?Anybody want to take a guess? (interruption) What? ìPayoff,î did you say? No. Thatís not the word. What one word is not in this entire New York Times story? Iíll give you a hint. It was the sole reason the left wanted to get their hands on Trumpís tax returns. (interruption) Russia! 10-4! Thatís it! They wanted Trumpís tax returns because their tax returns, they said, would prove Trump colluded because his money came from Russia, because his wealth was because and due to Russian connections.Thatís what everybody on the left was convinced was true, and now hereís the New York Times story. A yearlong investigation of Trumpís taxes going back more than 40 years, and theyíre not able to find any Russian money? So now they didnít find any Russian money, and I guarantee you they expected to. Theyíre the ones that said this! Theyíre the ones that saidÖ Iím talking about everybody on MSNBC, CNN.Go back a year, go back to the 2016 campaign when everybody was hell-bent on proving that Trump was a Putin stooge. Trump was a toady. Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enabled Trump to get rich ó and his tax returns would prove it, they said! So I guarantee you when the New York Times got these documents, the first thing they did was make a beeline, keyword search, however they search it, looking for ìRussia,î ìRussian,î Russian names. Answer? Big, fat zilch, zero, nada.So now theyíre back to something else. Now theyíre back to whatís always been said about Trump, that he got rich from his dad. Now theyíre saying that all kinds of phony entities were created like shell corporations and other things for Trump and his siblings ó not just Trump, Trump and his siblings ó to hide money from the IRS. Which, of course, they say is fraud. During all of this time, 40 years, you donít think Trumpís tax returns have been pored over with a fine-toothed comb by IRS auditors?Do you think the New York Times has found something the IRS didnít know? I mean, after looking at Trumpís tax returns. I think no Russia means gigantic letdown, which weíre not gonna see any evidence of because theyíre not gonna write that. But Iím telling you, they were so sure that thatís how theyíre gonna get Trump and thatís how theyíre gonna make Muellerís investigation pay off: Get Trumpís tax returns. If you just think about, youíll remember this.Now this big, long story in the upcoming Showtime documentary with no mention of Russia or Russians finances as part of Trumpís wealth. When they saw that it had to just devastate them. So now they have to go looking for other things in this that will supposedly knock Trump. But Iíll tell you this. Angus King, whoís a senator from Maine (heís an independent) was telling a couple of journalists (summarized), ìYou know, you peopleÖ If you think that this is gonna hurt Trump, you have got to learn something.ìYou people on the leftÖî This is Angus King. Heís an independent; he goes with the Democrats. ìYou gotta learn something: Every time the New York Times or CNN or the Washington Post attacks Donald Trump, you just glue Trumpís supporters even tighter to him. You think that Trump supporters are gonna be talked out of supporting Trump because of the New York Times? Itís never gonna happen.îAngus King said, ìThis isnít going to hurt Trump with his base. Itís not gonna cause to happen what you all want to happen. You want to separate Trump from his voters, but this isnít gonna do it. This is gonna make them stick to him even tighter, because this because this is what theyíre expecting you all to do. Theyíre expecting you to try to destroy him. They expect the media to be joined at the hip with the Democrat Party to take out the guy they voted for and elected.ìTrumpís voters admire him. Trumpís voters celebrate him. Trumpís voters back him ícause heís the only person like him out there in politics today that they can support.î Thatís Angus King. Only time will tell if this is gonna have some deleterious effect. But, folks, look at all the things that the mediaís dredged up since the 2016 campaign that they thought was gonna be the silver bullet.Every one of these things they came up with was going to be the final nail in the coffin. The NBC Access Hollywood video.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I think this whole thing has been a deep state setup job against both Trump and Kavanaugh, that this whole Christine Blasey Ford thing is a setup. I think the whole thing is a setup, and Iím gonna tell you when I thought that, folks ó and Iím not at the point where I can go into details right now.  It would not be productive.  The minute I saw Dianne Feinstein hold up that letter and talk about having got it? Nah. It just started to smell right there, ícause I know these people, and the evidence of this is right in front of our faces.  All we need to see is the DOJ-FBI silent coup that was run against Trump on this bogus Russia collusion. Look at all of the allegations against Donald Trump that have turned out to be nothing.  Nothing can be proven, established, nothing can be made of them.  And they have been never ending, from the moment Trump got in the campaign.  The really big things like Trump colluding with Russia. Remember, thatís what finding the tax returns was all about.  I have to make this point again.  The left wanted Trumpís tax returns ícause that was gonna be the end.  They were gonna be able to prove it! Thatís why Trump wouldnít release them, remember?  They said it would prove that Trumpís wealth comes from Russia.  And thatís why Trump is a Putin stooge, that Trump would be nothing if it werenít for Putin and the Russians.  Trump would have gone broke long ago.But Putin and the Russians bailed him out, and thatís why Putin wanted Trump elected and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  So now we get news the New York Times has had Trumpís tax returns for a year, and theyíre poring through them. At the same time, Showtime network is doing a documentary on the New York Times story and reporting in Trumpís taxes.  And would you believe it? Theyíve had these documents on Trumpís taxes for a year.  They ran the big story today, yesterday.  Thereís not a word about Russia anywhere in the Trump tax return story, and Iíll guarantee you this.  When the New York Times got whatever they have of Trumpís tax returns, I will guarantee you the first thing they zeroed in on was trying to find evidence that Trump was doing business ó shady business ó with somebody or a series of people (oligarchs, donít you know) in Russia.  Iím here to tell you that the let join that they experienced when they didnít find Russia in there nearly destroyed them.  So theyíve been look at these things for a year now trying to find an alternate way of destroying Trump with his tax records ícause the Russian angle bombed out.  Thatís the big take-away on Trumpís taxes, to me: What isnít there versus what they thought was going to be there.   Virtually every one of these attempts to get Trump has been concocted.  Every one of them has been the result of a created and organized strategic plan, be it the silent coup on Trump-Russia collusion, be it Comey trying to set Trump up with Comeyís being fired.  It has been, since Trump was inaugurated ó even during the transition itís been ó a series of steps or efforts to get rid of Donald Trump, to overthrow the election results of 2016.  I think Christine Blasey Ford is an element of that whole movement or that whole desire.  The Democrat Party is in on it.  They are as much a part of the deep state as the FBI, DOJ people that were doing this.  And I think the objective of Christine Blasey Ford ó this whole thing; not her specifically.  Look, I think sheís an activist and in on it.  But thatís neither here nor there.    "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/03/how-rachel-mitchell-quietly-blew-up-dr-fords-testimony/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 3, 2018RUSH: What is this? (interruption) You want a replay of the babe that imitated Dr. Blasey Ford? Snerdley didnít hear it yesterday? Okay, can we grab that from the archives? I just saw the note. Can we grab that from the archives again? The actress, who Iím still not gonna name because sheís gotten in a lot of trouble with her buddies on the left for doing this, but I mean it is so spot on. Weíll get to that. Weíve got a lot of time to get to that. Greetings, and welcome, folks. Here we are revved and ready again, just as I said yesterday we would be, at the Rush Limbaugh program and the EIB Network.Itís 800-282-2882 if you want to be on the program. Got it already? Okay. Letís do this and get it out of the way and then thereís a couple of other things I want to do to get out of the way before we get to the meat of this. I just want to point out that Christine Blasey Fordís entire testimony was blown up by an ex-boyfriend of six years. The ex-boyfriend describes how, after he broke up with her, she continued to use his credit card, that she never once expressed a fear of flying, that she lived for a time in a 500-square-foot home, so sheís not claustrophobic.He said it didnít have two doors, that she never once mentioned being sexually assaulted by anybody, and the big deal is that she helped people prep to take lie-detector tests. She never had a fear of flying. (cough) Iíve got a frog in my throat today, folks, and until I get rid of this I may sporadically cough out there. Itís very rude and I apologize in advance for it. She never once mentioned sexual assault. He had sent a letter and signed it.His nameís been redacted. He sent a letter to the committee. The point is, look, sheís a doctor of psychology. She knows how to manipulate lie detector tests. Sheís coached people on how to do it. And, again, just to review, never mentioned assault, never mentioned by Kavanaugh, ex-boyfriend of six years, never demonstrated any kind of claustrophobia, never expressed or showed a fear of flying. In fact, they flew all around Hawaii, this boyfriend and Dr. Ford in a little prop plane, and she never expressed any problem with flying.He also says that she is a polygraph expert and she cheated on him, but that was just a bonus. She cheated on him and that was just a bonus. Now it has also been learnedÖ (cough) I want to try to develop this laterÖ I really hope this doesnít mean that Iím getting a cold. You get a frog in your throatÖ (interruption) Red tide? You talking about the algae thing thatísÖ? (interruption) No, no, no, no, no. I smoke enough cigars to be immune from most things.(interruption) Oh, yeahÖ nicotine that provides the immunity? It really does in my case. I can prove it. Every time Iíve quit smoking Iíve gotten a perpetual never-ending cold. Hey, donít distract me on this. Red tide. Algae. Ron DeSantis will fix that after he becomes governor. Iíve seen his TV ads. Heís gonna fix that. Thatís his primary message in his campaign ad. Heís gonna fix the bad algae and the red tide out there, Ron DeSantis.I was gonna try to make the case here today, do you remember the prosecutor that the Republicans hired, Rachel Mitchell? And everybody was just disappointed as hell and panning her and say whatís going. In retrospect now with things that we have learned just in the last 24 hours, that woman was brilliant. That woman has caught Christine Ford in lies. If theyíre ever needed, if itís ever needed to expose this woman, I think people are gonna try to get through this without exposing Ford for what she is. (interruption)Yeah, yeah, yeah, Iím gonna talk about what Trump did, but Trump did not mock her last night. He made fun of her claims. He did not imitate the way she speaks. But, look, I understand Republican senators being alarmed about that, but you gotta look at it this way. Trump is simply providing them cover. Trump is giving them shade to go ahead and vote the way heÖ Trump said what needs to be said, but these guys arenít gonna say it.Her timeline alone has shifted.†When do you think this incident with Kavanaugh, the alleged incident happened? Because she has described it as early í82, mid-í82, sometime in í83, her timeline has changed based on who sheís been talking to, and that has been documented. The fact that she has lied openly now about not knowing anything about polygraphs and not helping people pass them. Thereís a signatory to one of the support letters written for her, Monica McLean, retired FBI, special agent, her best friend for life, and she is named as one of the people that helped Dr. Ford pass a lie detector test in her employment application for the FBI. Monica McLean issued a statement to ABC: ìI have never had Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken at any time.îI think theyíve been caught big time, and Rachel Mitchell, if I have timeÖ Iíve just got enough data on this right before the program began. I didnít have time to assemble it. But the questioning that we all thought was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr. Ford to so many lies that if it ever became necessary to use them, she could be destroyed. Credibility, credibility could be destroyed. I think everybodyís gonna try to get past this or through this without any challenging of Dr. Ford because sheís elicited such sympathy.One of the ways she did that was with her speech pattern, which I am one of the only people in the media that I know have pointed out her speech pattern. Look, Iím a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist. Vocal work, voice capabilities, voice talents (cough), excuse me againÖ I may have gotten it out of there that time, weíll see, are a specialty of mine.I recognize speech patterns. I am able to attach speech patterns to personality types. You can definitely do this. Well, a voice actress in Hollywood decided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr. Ford afterwards, and the Twitter universe came down on this woman mercilessly. So we have not mentioned her name. Itís out there, but I want to protect her at least here from any further assaults taking place. But here is what she posted and it is so spot on.ACTRESS: I donít know if anybody is listening to the Dr. Blasey Ford testimony about Brett Kavanaugh, but this is how I sound. I know itís a surprise to even me that I talk this way and Iím a doctor and a grown woman. I sound like Iím still back at that high school party. Um, I canít help it. I just have this kind of a voice, like a baby, even though Iím a doctor, and Iím on this media circus political stage, and I have kids myself that I donít know why I speak with vocal fry (sic), but you can listen to my testimony and hear that a grown woman sounds this way, Dr. Blasey Ford, thank you.RUSH: And that speech pattern, what does it make you think? Youíre dealing with a child here, you know, the up-talking at the end of every sentence. Itís vulnerability. Itís fragility, almost, in a way, maybe even somebody nervous and traumatized and scared. And that is exactly the personality that I think she wanted to affect. And she succeeded with it. And itís because of that that I thinkÖ No matter what is learned about her and how much she has lied, if you will, which again, Rachel Mitchell has, if necessary, could blow this woman out of the water.Thatís what I hadÖ Nobody else has put this together, by the way, that Iíve seen. Iíve justÖ In random show prep, you know, story here, story there, Iíve been noticing things. Thereíll be a little reference to what Rachel Mitchell asked her about Subject A and her answer, then you read another story and thereís one more reference to Rachel Mitchell. And you put all these together, and itís almost as though Rachel Mitchell knew going in that she knew a lot more about Blasey Ford than anybody has alluded to.She knew about Monica McLean. She knew about the polygraph. Everybody, ìWhyís she asking this? Why are youÖ? This is not what this is about. This is about Kavanaugh. Why arenít you asking her details to confirm about her story?î Instead, this prosecutor was asking all about seemingly unrelated or not really important things. So we will just have to see. Again, Monica McLean, retired FBI, and this, by the way, brings up or conjures upÖ FBI? Ford has a best friend in the FBI who resigned, retired in 2016?I wonder how many people working on the Trump case at the FBI trying to establish collusion that Dr. Ford and Monica McLean know. You know, what kind of possible connection here is there, maybe? So itís fascinating, as is the letter from the ex-boyfriend. The primary reason the ex-boyfriend says he broke up with her is how she lied about using his credit card. He took her name off the credit card when they broke up, and she continued to use it.She charged about 600 bucks on it. Ford was asked directly in the hearing if she had given tips on how to pass a polygraph. She said, ìNever. Never.î Rachel Mitchell: ìHave you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to pay a polygraph test?î ìNever.î Remember when that question was asked? I do. ìWhat the hell was this?î Now, Senator Grassley has been busy refuting claims made by Avenatti and others.Grassley is on fire, by the way. Grassley is doing such a bang-up job, as is his staff here. Grassley has sent a letter to Fordís attorneys telling them about the ex-boyfriend seeing her coach somebody on how to pass a lie detector test and has again asked for the therapist notes and the polygraph, the audio-visual. They want to see it. Grassley and the committee want to see the notes of her meetings with her therapist and they want to see the polygraph test that Ford took.Fordís lawyers have refused to turn any of that over. So theyíre not being forthcoming with things that are crucial. Now Dianne Feinstein has made a move to seal the FBI investigation. I think they think the case is collapsing, and you know what I think evidence of the case collapsing is? This New York Times story on Trumpís taxes.Thatís the first thing I thought when I saw this New York Times story. Because theyíve been sitting on this so long that Showtime has been able to prepare a TV documentary on it. So Showtime, which is owned by CBS, has been working with the New York Times on this documentary on the supposedly explosive details of Trumpís taxes. And what do we know about Trumpís taxes?Well, itís a blockbuster story of the day. The Times reports that Trumpís father may have left him more money than anybody knew about 40 years ago and that Trump and his siblings set up shell corporations and phony ìthisesî and ìthatsî to hide the money from the IRS. Thereís another blockbuster story out there today that Kavanaugh wrote a letter to his college friends that they should warn the neighbors in the Ocean City condo they were renting that they might make some noise.He wrote the letter 33 years ago. This shows that Kavanaugh was out of control in high school, going to loud parties, creating loud parties, loud noise. He was so thoughtful, he sent neighbors a letter warning them that there might be some raucous noise coming from the condo when they threw the party. Thatís a blockbuster story out there. Monica McLean left the FBI and the DOJ after 24 years of employment there as soon as Trump won the election, 2016.The only thing Ford has turned over from the polygraph is two questions. Remember when that came up, the polygraph exam? I asked her two questions. Two questions? What polygraph test, what lie detector test only asks two questions? Thatís all the committee has been given. Now, Blasey has been citing the polygraph has proof that sheís telling the truth. And now here comes this ex-boyfriend saying thatÖThe problem with the ex-boyfriend is heís a boy, and that gives Democrat senators the right to totally disbelieve him. Men, of course, lie all the time about things. Women never do, as it goes.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination or to have Trump pull it.Now that that hasnít happened this case is beginning to collapse. You see stories all over the media about how all this so-called evidence just isnít there. They thought that the mere allegation would be enough, that Kavanaugh would not sit there and let his life be destroyed by this. They thought Trump wouldnít sit there and let his nominee be destroyed like that because they think Trumpís ego is such that he will not be allowed to be to look bad because of what somebody else did or didnít do.So they thought there would be a giant cave on this, and there hasnít been. So now it is panic and scramble time. So they zero in on Flake, and Trump couldnít hold it in anymore. Last night at the rally, he just unloads on the fact that Christine Ford doesnít have any evidence, is changing her story. And the media is all over the place now saying (paraphrased), ìWell, you know, this just may have screwed it. Murkowski and Collins, they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh.îOkay. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I told you some things yesterday that Iím sure people have forgotten. But theyíre no different today than they were yesterday. Democrat senators in red states are in heap big reelection trouble. In fact, there was news yesterday ó polling data, late polling data ó that we may be looking at a red wave in the Senate, not a blue wave. In North Dakota, which Trump carried by 36 points, Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo-doo after having come out against Kavanaugh.ìThe latest poll taken after the Democrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before the committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer, the Republican opponent to Heitkamp, has opened a 10-point lead over Heitkamp! Joe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous. Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing to her challenger, Josh Hawley. Joe Manchin, West VirginiaÖî Theyíve all been hoping that McConnell would wimp out or that some Republican senators would wimp out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to.In other words, these four ó Donnelly, McCaskill, Manchin, and Heitkamp ó have all been hoping that Collins caves, that maybe even McConnell would cave and that Murkowski would cave and will Flake will continue to flake and cave. But in their states, thereís hell to pay. In their states, people want Kavanaugh confirmed. In fact, in North Dakota, voters back Kavanaugh 60 to 27.Polling has begun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp. So my point is, it may not matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski. But if they actually donít vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night? Well, that would be embarrassing for them. Now, since Trumpís on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr. Ford, I want to share something with you I found today at Power Line.
Scott Johnson, one of the contributors at Power Line, writes, ìA reader [of theirs] however, writes to note the changes in Fordís timeline. The reader calls himself an ëengineer with a specialty in data visualization.í He made the graphicî he created a chart, in essence, ìdrawing on public sources ñ ëmainly the Washington Post and public legal documents.'î It is the dates, the varying dates, the different dates of the sordid event Dr. Blasey says happened ó and the dates float!Sheís not even consistent with the day. So the timeline of her story doesnít even add up. ìThe reader notes ëthe sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the Story Date column (first column). For six years her story was ëmid í80s.î ëWhy,í he asks, ëthe sudden change within a few weeks after 7-6-2018? Answer: Dr. Ford came into the Democrat orbits of Rep. Anna Eshoo (Democrat), Senator Dianne Feinstein (Democrat), their staffs and highly partisan Dem lawyer Debra Katz (recommended by Feinstein).ìRight after that, Dr. Ford changed her story two more times in two months ó growing more specific [after she began consulting with Democrat activists] ó as they conspired to damage Kavanaugh.î So the chart here ó and I know charts are difficult to convey, but this is a text chart. There is some bars in this thing. But it is entitled, ìDr. Christine Blasey Fordís Ever-Changing Story ó Multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incident.î In the therapist notes, the incident is said to have occurred in the mid-1980s when she in couples therapy.The therapist notes from when she was in individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid-eighties, but the late eighties! In her text message to the Washington Post, sheís back to saying that it happened in the mid-eighties. In her letter to Dianne Feinstein, she said the incident happened in the early eighties! In the handwritten statement at the time she took her polygraph, ìhigh school summer in the eightiesî and ìearlyî is crossed out.Early eighties could have been í80, í81. At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, she said it happened in the summer of 1982. She had never said that before. She had said mid-eighties, late eighties, mud eighties, early eighties, high school summer, early eighties. She specified summer 1982. These changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists, the staff of Feinstein and Anna Eshoo and Debra Katz, the lawyer.ìChristine Blasey Fordís Changing Kavanaugh Assault Story Leaves Her Short on Credibility ó Put aside Christine Blasey Fordís emotional performance. Her testimony revealed her as a witness whose memories change at her convenience. Ö First, Fordís testimony that the assault occurred in the summer of 1982, when just 15, conflicted with both her therapistís notes and the text message Ford sent to the Washington Post.îBREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: ìFirst, Fordís testimony that the assault occurred in the summer of 1982, when just 15, conflicted with both her therapistís notes and the text message Ford sent to the Washington Post. According to reporter Emma Brown, Ford claimed she had been assaulted in the mid-1980s; and the therapistís notes stated Ford had been the victim of an attempted rape in her late teens.î Well, she was 15 in 1982, 1983 somewhere along there, but the ìattempted rape happened in her late teens.ìBut by that time, Kavanaugh was attending Yale, so Fordís recasting of the attack to the summer of 1982 is suspect.î In other words, this event, if it happened, she had all kinds of potential dates where it could have happened ó and every time she reported this, the date changed. It became ìthe summer of í82î only after she began to consult with Feinsteinís staff and Anna Eshooís staff and her lawyer, Debra Katz.Iím convinced that they decided to claim the date was í82 so as to coincide with where Kavanaugh might have been able to be placed. ìShe still ó and this is fundamentally crucial. She still cannot specify when. Trump was right. She canít specify where ó meaning, the house. She canít specify the time of day. She doesnít remember how she got home. The floor plan of the house also changes. She ran out of a small bathroom to a bathroom in one instance of the story.In another instance, she they ran out of the small bathroom into a living room, family room, combo room. So much of her story is fluid, and the Democrats know everything that Iím telling you. It doesnít matter, because this is purely political, itís not about sexual abuse. Itís political, and therefore sheís gonna be believed, Did anybody find it strange, the minute she makes the allegation here comes a movie or a video of Hollywood actresses and all these Democrat Senators, ìI believe her.îBased on what? Well, Iíll tell you: Based on the necessity of believing her, because this whole thing was strategized. This is what the left does. Meanwhile, the country is being asked to feel so bad and so sorry for a woman who was so mistreated. Donít forget, even the number of witnesses that she claims were there changes ó and the sexual makeup, the gender makeup. Some cases five people there. Some cases three people plus her.In one instance, itís all guys. In one instance, itís all guys and one woman her best friend. But no matter. Everybody she places there denies being there, ícause she doesnít know when it was! I really think having now looked at Rachel Mitchellís questions in the aftermath of what we have learned that I think Mitchell was brilliant. I think Rachel MitchellÖIf it ever comes to this, her questions and the answers from Ford are gonna be able to be assembled and compared with what Ford has said and the Democrats have said, and I think sheÖ If it comes to this, she could be exposed as a serial perjurer. That was what Rachel Mitchell was after. Nobody saw it at the time. Everybody thought Republicans were making a big mistake here rather than challenging her honesty and veracity while she was testifying.  "

Whatís her name? Christine Fair? Dr. Carol Christine Fair? Anybody heard of her? Let me tell you who she is. She is an associate professor in the security studies program at Georgetown. Georgetownís not an insignificant university. Georgetown is theÖ In fact, Georgetown University was the nucleus, the center of the movement to give women as much contraceptive help as possible, birth control pills as far as the eye could see. Georgetown was the center in that movement. And this babeÖ Well, speaking loosely here. This woman, Dr. Carol Christine Fair, is an associate professor in the Security Studies Program. I donít know what securities studies is.You would think that itís like national security, but it could be home security. I donít know what it is. Womenís studies, deep-diving studies, any number of other studies. Well, Dr. Carol Christine Fair, an associate professor in the Security Studies Program at Georgetown, said white GOP Senators deserve to die miserable deaths ëwhile feminists laugh as they take their last gasps.í She went on a profanity-laced tirade against Kavanaugh, calling him a ërapistí and ëperjurer.í This is a professor at Georgetown. She described the Republican Party as an ëfóing death cultí and ëfilthy swine.íShe tweeted, ìLook at thus (sic) chorus of entitled white men justifying a serial rapistís arrogated entitlement. All of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps. Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine? Yes.î Thatís a professor. That is a tenured and highly respected professor at Georgetown University. ìAll of them deserve miserable deaths while feminists laugh as they take their last gasps. Bonus: we castrate their corpses and feed them to swine?îIs there any embarrassment over Dr. Christine? No. But Iím telling you this is why I have ascribed the theory that what liberalism and the American left has become is essentially a party of psychological disorders infiltrating our political system and demanding that their psychological disorders be treated as serious policy disagreements and that they be given policies they demand. Weíre dealing with people that have psychological disorders whoíve become the base of the Democrat Party.All of them are victims. Itís somebody elseís fault. ìDr. Fair said this in response to Senator Lindsey Graham blasting Democrats for the biggest political sham heís ever seen.î After this tweet, she is still employed at Georgetown, where probably she was applauded by several others there who share other psychological disorders. Now, Twitter has removed her account after she tweeted that white men should be castrated and fed to pigs. But she is still at Georgetown. And she probably will be back on Twitter after a limited amount of time.Folks, if you are a woman and if you are the mother of sons, and, if, in this climate, you vote for any Democrats, you need to really think about that, because you are more than likely voting to put your sons in lifelong political peril. If youíre married to a man in any job or income bracket and you vote for any Democrat, you are living on borrowed time. Your whole life can blow up at any second. The Democrat Party, the American left can come along at any time and take out your man, if they need to.If you have brothers and vote for any Democrat, you are sentencing your brothers to blindsiding potential ruination. Even your father in his 70s or 80s is not immune to having his life wiped out of the existence with one Drive-By news story. If you have any treasured men in your life, a high school or college friend, a mentor, a neighbor, a business partner, a pastor, a boss, a coach. If you have any men in your life that you love, respect, and like, and you vote for any Democrat, you are putting them all at risk.They are one Drive-By Media story or one moment of attention away from potential destruction, one accusation, regardless how uncorroborated or ridiculous it may be. I know that there are angry women like Christine Fair out there, and I know that there are angry women like Dr. Ford and others. But they are not the sample size of American women. If youíre a standard-issue, ordinary, normal, loving female living in America and you vote for any Democrat, you really need to stop and think about it.  "

Swetnick is the woman who claimed that Kavanaugh and his buddy, Mark Judge, gave women booze and pills to essentially incapacitate them while setting up gang ìrape trainsî for their buddies in school.She has under withering investigation said (paraphrasing), ìWell, (sputtering) I ó I donít know that Kavanaugh everÖ I ó I ó IÖ He was in the vicinity. Itís very, very coincidental if he didnít do it.î But sheís backing off of it. NBC News, Kate Snow was very depressed, very disappointed. They canít corroborate anything she said! Theyíre trying as hard as they can! They canít find any evidence that what sheís saying is true, Swetnick.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: NBC News has had to admit that they are unable to independently corroborate the claims of Julie Swetnick, unable to independently corroborate Swetnickís claims and has not spoken with anybody who says they saw Swetnick at parties with Kavanaugh! They canít find anybody that can place her there!But she says she was at 10 parties where Kavanaugh and his buddies were running rape trains, gang rape trains. They canít find anybody who saw Swetnick. Swetnick was a college student when Kavanaugh and his buddies were high school students! Everybodyís asking, ìWhatís a college student, female, hanging around at a high school party for ó and why keep going back to gang rapes, if thatís whatís happening at these parties?î You know what her lawyer said to that? Her lawyer said that she was doing research!Yeah. Julie Swetnick kept going to these gang rape parties to gather evidence, to do research. But NBC ó and believe me, theyíre lookiní. NBC News canít find anybody who says they saw Swetnick at parties with Kavanaugh. Kavanaugh has said he doesnít know Swetnick and has called her claims a farce. ìEx-Boyfriend Says Swetnick Threatened to Kill His Unborn Baby, ëWas Exaggerating Everything.ëî Look, Julie Swetnick isnít credible, just like Christine Ford isnít credible. I donít mean to insult anybody here, but weíve been through it a thousand times.Ford? Nobody she says was there says they were. She doesnít know where or when. She doesnít what she said afterwards and how she got home. She doesnít know anything, other than Kavanaugh did it. She has no credibility and neither does Swetnick. So Swetnick isnít credible. Ford isnít either. Feinstein is not credible! The Democrat Party is not credible. The media is not credible. There is no credibility on the allegation side of this entire Kavanaugh story.Last night on Laura Ingrahamís show on Fox News, ìJulie Swetnickís ex-boyfriend, Richard Vinneccy, details why the third Kavanaugh accuser is unreliable. Vinneccy says Swetnick never mentioned having been sexually assaultedî to him. ìThe ex-boyfriend of Julie Swetnick, the third woman to make uncorroborated, lurid allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, told Fox News exclusively on Monday that she had threatened to kill his unborn child and at times even bizarrely asked him to hit her.ìëRight after I broke up with her, she basically called me many times and at one point she basically said, ëYou will never, ever see your unborn child alive,í Richard Vinneccy said on The Ingraham Angle. According to Vinneccy, Swetnick told him at the time, ëIím just going to go over there and kill you guys.í Swetnick is represented by Ö Michael Avenatti. He did not immediately respond to Fox Newsí request for comment on Vinneccyís allegation, but in an interview on CNN Monday night, he cast doubt on Vinneccyís credibility and characterized him as an estranged ex-boyfriend.îAgain, ìNBC: We Canít Corroborate Any of the Claims Made by Julie Swetnick, Also Her Claims Have Shifted.î Swetnick said she saw boys ìcongregating outside rooms,î but, quote, ìI didnít know what was occurring.î Wait a minute! You started out saying there were gang rapes going on in there, and now youíre saying, ìI donít know?î And she says that she never saw Kavanaugh in the room, but he was outside, sheís sure, and thatís not a coincidence.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Julie Swetnick: ìI cannot specifically say that Kavanaugh was one of the ones who assaulted me, but before this happened to me at the party, I saw him there. If Brett Kavanaugh was one of those people that did this to me, there is no way in the worldÖî If? Wait a minute! I thought he was. I thought he was running the show here. Now she canít place him there? Julie Swetnick.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Iíve got some Julie Swetnick sound bites. I want to share íem with you. They are sound bites from an MSNBC interview. Kate Snow is the senior national correspondent for NBC News. She used to be with CNN. She interviewed Swetnick. Iím gonna set this up again by reminding you of a few things, which youíre going to hear, which will then more easily help you to remember that you heard it.Youíve been told, and then youíll hear it for yourself, and that way it will remain with you. She is taking back that Kavanaugh organized gang-rape trains at these 10 high school parties she attended while a college student. Let me just tell you, as a former high school student who went to parties, if a college babe had shown up, it would have been nirvana. Iím just telling you. If a college babe had shown up? Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! If a college guy had shown up, we would have all known the guyís striking out with college girls and is showing up to a high school party trying to impress the high school girls.But Swetnick showing up at these high school parties, claiming that Kavanaugh and a friend of his were drugging and liquoring up women to get them compliant so as to be able to pull off gang-rape trains. Youíll hear her pull back (summarized), ìWell, uhhh, I canít say specifically that Kavanaugh was one of the ones who assaulted me, but before this happened to me at that party I saw him there. He was there! If Kavanaugh was one of those people that did this to me, thereís no way in the world he should go on the court.î But she canít place him there other than say itís coincidental.So here we go with Kate Snow. The first question on our sound bite roster: ìCan you tell me what happened as much as youíre comfortable saying?îSWETNICK: (haltingly) I was at a party, and I remember that I started not to feel very well. And they went I know I was shoved into a room and Iím having my clothes torn different directions. I was touched everywhere. Uh, I was physically assaulted in every way you can possibly physically assault a woman. It was horrible. I had no way to fend them off.SNOW: You know what Iím gonna ask:Everyone is wondering if one of those people was Brett Kavanaugh.SWETNICK: I cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me.RUSH: What? What? Well, thatís not what the original claim was! Your lawyer puts this last-minute claim out there. ìI canít specificallyÖî NBC is starting to get deflated already. They think theyíve got the gold mine of interviews. Theyíve got the get of gets. Theyíve got Julie Swetnick. The problem is her lawyer didnít properly vet her, because her lawyer didnít think with the media, itíd be necessary. The media would accept whatever he tells them ícause the media wants to get Kavanaugh too. NBC, I donít know if theyíre really vetting her or just trying to get confirmation here to add to what they want to do.So Kate Snow then says, ìDid you see Brett Kavanaugh spiking the punch? Did you see him putting grain alcohol in the punch?îSWETNICK: I saw him giving red Solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame, and there was grain punch at those parties. And I would not take one of those glasses from Mark Kavanaugh ó Brett Kavanaugh. Excuse me. I saw him around the punch containers. I donít know what he did, but I saw him buy them. Yes.RUSH: Well, now, whatÖ? (laughing) You see whatís happening? First, he set up the gang rape trains. He was responsible for drugging and alcoholing, liquoring up the women. Now, ìOh, no, I canít say he assaulted me.î She apparently was assaulted in any which way you can imagine, but she canít name him, and then when itÖ (paraphrased exchange) ìDid you see him spike the punch with grain alcohol?î (laughing) ìWell, I saw him have a lot of red Solo cups. I wouldnít take a red Solo Cup from Brett Kavanaugh no matter what you gave me!îNow weíve got the fear of the red Solo Cup. How do we know it was a Solo Cup? Thereís a lot of different manufacturers of cups, including Playtex. How do we know that it was a Solo Cup? Solo is being sullied here, that their cups are being used in the abuse of women. Then NBC admits they cannot locate two of her witnesses! One of the witnesses she names says he never heard of her, and the fourth witness that she named is dead.SNOW: We havenít heard from those friends. So Iím asking, you know (sputters), are there people óSWETNICK: Yes.SNOW: ó alive today óSWETNICK: Yes. I hañ I have ó I ó I óSNOW: ó who would say, ìYes, I went to those parties with Julieî?SWETNICK: I have ó Yes. There are people that know about those parties.SNOW: (dramatic voiceover) This morning, Swetnick provided four names of friends she says went to the parties with her. Ö One of them said he does not recall a Julie Swetnick. Another of the friends she named is deceased. Weíve reached out to the other two and havenít heard back.RUSH: ìSsssssssssssssî is the sound of air coming out of a balloon or any other inflatable object. Next, we go to Swetnickís former boyfriend, who was on The Ingraham Angle last night on the Fox News Channel. This is Richard Venneccy (is the pronunciation). The question: ìYou claim that Ms. Swetnick threatened you after you broke up with her. What types of threats are you alleging?îVENNECCY: Right after I broke up with her she basically called me many times, and at one point she basically say, ìYouíll never, ever see your unborn child alive, and I just gonna go over there and kill you guys.îINGRAHAM: She said she was gonna kill you?VENNECCY: Yes.RUSH: Right. After sheíd dealt with the unborn baby. She was gonna do that first. ìYouíll never, ever see your unborn child aliveÖî Do the Democrats really want to stand behind this? Is this what they want to vouch for? Theyíre backing off of this. Again, I donít mean to be redundant, but Dianne Feinstein all of a sudden this afternoon bringing up the fact, ìWe need to start looking again at his Roe v. Wade decision, womenís reproductive health and his assault weapons thinking on it.î Why? Thatís been vetted long ago.And you didnít have anything to opposed him there. SoÖ Can you imagine how they feel about this? I mean, theyíre fools to believe this was real in the first place. But theyíre so damn desperate.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So to sum up Julie Swetnick, sheís gone from all these wild claims to now saying that Kavanaugh didnít do it ó didnít drug her, didnít gang rape here, didnít set íem up. Now she only allegedly places him nearby and has now a fear of red Solo cups. She doesnít know if he spiked the punch with grain alcohol. She doesnít know if he was there when she was assaulted over every bit of her body, she said. And the people that she says can confirm her story are dead or donít know her.So tell me how is this verified? How do we corroborate Julie Swetnick? We donít. So all the Democrats have here is ìthe seriousness of the charge,î but they got zip, zero, nada evidence. So Avenatti, her lawyer, has been doing damage control, and heís out there saying that one of Swetnickís friends told her that Kavanaugh was spiking the punch. Oh ho! Oh! We got it wrong first, Judge. It wasnít that she saw Kavanaugh. Somebody told her that Kavanaugh was spiking the punch. She never saw it.So now the FBI has to go out and try to find this so-called witness. This is a great game the Democrats think they have going. ìOh, no, it wasnít Kavanaugh! (stammering) She saw somebody!î Thatís why this stuff has got to stop. By the way, you heard Chuck You Schumer in that sound bite floor of the Senate say, ìKavanaugh is talking to his friends at Yale.î So what? Could somebody tell me what is wrong with Kavanaugh calling people he went to school with at Yale and asking them to tell people what they knew?What is so wrong with that?Thereís even a tinge of suspicion attached to that. Do you think the Democrats around scouring, either, for people who will claim to be Julie Swetnickís buddies? Do you think the Democrats are not doing that? What is so wrong with Kavanaugh calling people he went to school with at Yale and asking them if they remember all this stuff that didnít happen? I mean, even trying to confirm and prove your innocence ó which shouldnít even be what Kavanaugh has to do. Even that is now being accused by the Democrats.And all these otherÖ Thereís a bunch of other people, classmates at Yale, claiming that Kavanaugh has lied about his binge drinking. But there arenít any witnesses that can show that. ìIn the wake of Kavanaughís testimony before the committee last Thursday, the media have doubled down on efforts to turn up evidence of illicit behavior in high school and collegeî because theyíre trying to bolster Ford. Theyíre trying to find anything ícause Ford doesnít have anything, either. Theyíre trying to find anything to save her story, and they canít.They canít find anybody that can confirm what these late-arriving witnesses, Ramirez and Swetnick, are saying. And this brings meÖ I referenced this in the first hour of the program, ìThe Case Against Kavanaughís Collapsing,î by David French, who is a leading Never Trumper at National Review.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/02/heres-why-i-led-with-nafta-yesterday/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 2, 2018RUSH: I was just made aware of an audio sound bite that happened on PMSNBC this morning. Bill Burton, who is the former deputy Obama White House press secretary, was talking about me and Kavanaugh. They were monitoring this program. Doesnít surprise me a bit that the Obama people are still monitoring this program. And Iím just gonna tell you. Iím not surprised. I did not predict this, but I wondered if somebody was going to notice what I did yesterday. Hereís Craig Melvin, the host, setting up Burton with the question.MELVIN: Let me ask you really quickly here, Mr. Burton, about this Washington Post article yesterday. The right has come alive with impassioned defenses of Kavanaugh in recent days. Talk show host Rush Limbaugh unleashed a torrent of criticism on the air such as his riff last week on militant feminism. ìThese women are angry,î Limbaugh said. ìSomething has happened to them in their lives, and their rage and anger, they take it out now on the country or on all men or men in ìthe powerful majority,î which is white Christian men and so forth.î Again, thatís a quote from Rush Limbaugh. Thoughts?BURTON: Look, I listened to some Rush Limbaugh yesterday and what I noticed about his show that he actually started with half an hour about trade before getting into the Kavanaugh stuff. And it made me feel like maybe some of the energy was gone.RUSH: I am so happy somebody noticed that. Now, if you were listening yesterday, you know why I did it. Because I told you why I did it. I told you why I opened with NAFTA. And Iíll repeat myself again. We started out by pointing out Trump had done a 30- to 45-minute ceremony announcing NAFTA in the Rose Garden, and he had all the people that had helped make it happen there, and I pointed out that this is something that the press is gonnaÖTheyíre there in attendance, but all they want to ask Trump about is Kavanaugh. Theyíre not asking about NAFTA. Theyíre gonna look past it because to them it isnít any big deal. Itís trade. Big whoop. Theyíre missing it again. This is a seminal Trump campaign issue! Something that he promised, something that he committed to doing and came through and did it! He got rid of NAFTA! And I knew that if I didnít open the program talking about it, we wouldnít talk about it because it would be swept away by the Kavanaugh stuff.So I, as I told you yesterday, opened with it to make sure that we discussed it here and to make sure you in this audience heard the discussion and realize the importance of it. Because itís relevant! When you start talking about election turnout in November, when you again remind people that Donald Trump happens to be the rare politician that actually keeps promises, makes them and does his best to keep them. And this is a huge one! I knew the media was gonna look past it. The media was gonna think that Trumpís probably using it to distract people from Kavanaugh because of how badly Kavanaughís going in their minds.Thatís not at all what was going on. Trump was singing his own praises because he should have been. Itís a huge achievement. Let me tell you something else about this. Since Mr. Burton has availed me the opportunity to talk about this again, nobody is talking about this, but Iím here to tell you that gutting NAFTA, when you go inside the Beltway, when you get into the heart of the swamp, when you get into the bowels of the Washington establishment, gutting NAFTA is killing them! NAFTA.If you go back to 1991 and í92 when NAFTA was put together, the entirety of the Washington establishmentÖ I mean, intelligence, foreign policy, State Department, Commerce Department, marketing department, everybody was in on it. It was a huge deal. It mattered to the swamp because it was one of the first early steps toward establishing the concept of globalism. It wasnít a direct assault on sovereignty of the United States, but it took us down that road. It established international tribunals to which the United States would be subordinate to, such as the World Trade Organization.And the Washington establishment, the exact people Trump ran against, the exact people Trump defeated, NAFTA was their baby. They conceived it. They birthed it. They raised it. They stood by it. They loved it. And itís gone. It took them years to get NAFTA written. It took them months to get it passed. P-a-s-s-e-d. As I say, it was a serious and important step toward globalism and subordinating the United States to world tribunals, like the World Trade Organization and the International Criminal Court and this kind of thing.It was not making America great again, and it was not putting America first. NAFTA and deals like it are kinds of things that establishment types see as their purpose and their expertise. This kind of thing, these kinds of trade deals and promoting globalism and a gigantic world structure, a world order that McCain often spoke about, this is why they are there. And itís gone. Well, Iím telling you foreign policy wonksÖ It did not getting any coverage ícause Kavanaugh is dwarfing everything, but Iím here to tell you that all of these invisible swamp dwellers who live and die by such things as NAFTA are beside themselves that Trump got this done.It is a huge middle finger to them. Now, to Bill Burton itís just trade. (Impression) ìAh, Limbaugh on his show talking about trade was not Kavanaugh because Kavanaughís not inspiring anybody.î How can anybody listen to this program and think that? Creating NAFTA took these people years. Trump guts it, he replaces it in months, and to add insult to injury, the Mexicans and the Canadians want to be part of it! They asked to be part of it! Their noses are not out of joint. Theyíre not crying and moaning about the loss of NAFTA.They want in on this new Trump deal. And that is also profoundly insulting to the swamp dwellers. They canít see straight! This is just more hatred for Trump! This is justÖ Itís blinding them. And now thereís a companion story (I didnít have a chance to get to it yesterday) that the ChiComs are getting ready to lower their trade barriers on U.S. exports because of Trumpís tariffs! Itís all working! This is something these guys never even tried to do!To straighten out the trade imbalance with the ChiComs? The swamp dwellers never even tried to do that. That was just another circumstance we had to accept in the modern world. And watch whatís gonna happen next. Iíll tell you right here and now, Iran is gonna come to the table. You watch when that happens. This is all falling into place for Trump, exactly as he said, exactly as he is making happen.I donít know how many of you do wire transfers, but thereís a form of wire transfer called SWIFT. And if Europe goes ahead and puts in a replacement for SWIFT, Trump is liable to freeze the Iranians out of using it, meaning theyíll have trouble moving their money around. Thatís why I brought it up because it is such a huge deal in so many ways. Itís a huge deal in turning the swamp upside down and inside out, and it is a huge deal for Trump, making America great again, putting America first, and following through on a deeply, deeply committed and highly touted campaign promise. Trade deals were among Trumpís top three campaign issues.Itís not an accident that 90,000 tried to get in to see Trump at Johnson City, Tennessee, after the NAFTA deal was done. The people in Washington, the Drive-By Media are totally missing this. Itís not sexy to them. Itís not a big deal. NAFTA, trade deal, yeah. Screw Trump for doing it. But they donít have any ability to see its connection and its relevance and its importance in Trump supporters remaining revved up and loyal.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, Trump is gonna actually go up to the Senate and get them to ratify NAFTA rather than ìdeemî it to have been passed. Thatís a trick Obama played when he couldnít get Senate ratification. He would just deem it to have been passed and then implement it. Itís one of the tricks he played with, I think, the Iranian nuclear deal. Itís one of the reasons Trump was able to unwind that. There was the Corker loophole, everything else. But Trumpís gonna actually go up there and get this thing ratified, this new NAFTA deal. This is the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement or some such thing.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Hereís Trump. Weíve got time to get this. Grab sound bite No. 28. This afternoon Trump at the White House line talking about the new NAFTA replacement agreement, the USMCA trade agreementÖTHE PRESIDENT: The deal we made with Canada and Mexico has gotten tremendous reviews, as you see. Itís been very well received by farmers and ranchers and industrialists and workers generally, and itís been really something. But itís gotten tremendous reviews, and even many of the Democrats ó including Chuck Schumer ó came out and said nice things. Itís nice to see a little bit of a bipartisan approach. But the big trade deal, the largest deal ever made so far in trade, I expect to top it with China or EU or something. As you know now, weíre working on China, weíre working on Japan, weíre working on EU. But these are great deals for our nation and great deals for our workers. I think the Democrats are gonna like the trade deal. They already do. A lot of them have come out and said very positive things about it. We seem to have great support for the trade bill. It covers just about everybody.RUSH: Yeah, well, a bunch of swamp dwellers are not happy. Their lifeís work went up in smoke when NAFTA died.  "

This was yesterday me on my own showÖBEGIN ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: This has got to be stopped, because itís not real! The Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go. Submit names they want the FBI to talk to? Investigations donít work that way! The FBI follows evidence, leads, and when they donít find anything ó unlike Bob Mueller ó they stop. Mueller has been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and hasnít found any, but heís still going, and thatís exactly what this is gonna be if somebody doesnít stand up and stop this.Somebody on the Senate Judiciary Committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start vouching for the investigation thatís taken place. There are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh. Somebody needs to speak up for him. Somebody anybody vouch for him. Somebody needs to stand up and say, ìThey have been thorough, and they havenít found anything, or he wouldnít be where he is now, sitting on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.î But thatís not happening.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Well, but it is now. Late yesterday afternoon, Senate floor, here is the Turtle.MCCONNELL: On top of its six prior investigations of Judge Kavanaugh, Democrats demanded a supplemental investigation. If you listen carefully, Mr. President, you can practically hear the sounds of the Democrats moving the goalposts. But the goal hasnít moved an inch. Not an inch. The goal has been the same all along. The time for endless delay and obstruction has come to a close. Judge Kavanaughís nomination is out of committee. Weíre considering it here on the floor ó and, Mr. President, weíll be voting this week.RUSH: Late yesterday afternoon, Mitch McConnell on the floor of the Senate, and he got so much support for what he did yesterday. Amazing how that happens, isnít it? He heard from so many people what a great thing it was, that he went out and he did it again. He went out there again, and he recycled the old Bill Clinton line to boot! Hereís McConnell from just a couple hours ago.MCCONNELL: When Judge Kavanaugh demonstrated his widely acknowledged brilliance, open-mindedness, and collegiality at his confirmation hearings, some chose a darker road. The politics of personal destruction were willfully unleashed. After the FBI shares what theyíve found, senators will have the opportunity to vote. Weíll have the opportunity to vote ìnoî on the politics of personal destruction. Weíll have the opportunity to vote ìyesî on this fine nominee.RUSH: That doesnít even touch what he did. He went out there and heÖ He didnít call these guys out by name, but he quoted some of the most outrageous lies that Democrats have been telling, including members of the Judiciary Committee. He pointed out their hypocrisy. He pointed out their prevarications. He pointed out their straight, up-and-up lies. It was so good that it forced Chuck You Schumer to go to the floor to rebut it! Chuck You went out there and tried to make chicken salad out of what. It was incredible listening to Chuck You.(impression) ìI believe Christine. She was eminently credible. Judge Kavanaugh is not.î Itís the other way around! We have a lifetime of investigation of Brett Kavanaugh, folks. There have been six, now seven FBI investigations and background checks. We have had more people looking into every nook and cranny of Brett Kavanaughís life, and we havenít even begun to look at hers. Weíre just assuming sheís credible because thatís the Democratsí position on this.They can go back and they can look at anything Kavanaughís done, but she is off-limits for some reason. We canít go and find out what she did at all those beach parties. We canít go out and found out what she did when she was out there skiing and surfing and flying around. Pfft! None of thatís been done, and yet she is credible and he isnít. And now DiFi. Drive-Bys ran into DiFi. She was going someplace up on Capitol Hill. A reporter said, ìSenator Feinstein, would a floor vote Friday on Kavanaugh be too soon?îFEINSTEIN: Oh, I believe it is. I believe itís too soon. Itís Tuesday, and, uh óRUSH: Stop the tape! Itís what everybody agreed to. Oh, by the way, you know what Flake is now saying? This guy, FlakeÖ Thereís a part of me that thinks that he was in on this from the get-go. Thereís a part of me that thinks he was not scared to death when he got harassed and protested in the elevator. Thereís part of me that thinks heís in on it, ícause he hates Trump and thatís what all this really is. All of this is aimed at people hating Trump, and Kavanaughís in the way. In order to get Trump, they gotta get Kavanaugh.But Flake is out there saying, ìYou know what? I, umÖ I ó I ó IÖ (sputtering) Kavanaughís too partisan for me. I donít think we need that on the court.î Wait a minute! You said you were gonna vote for him Friday morning, Flake, and then you did! Flake voted for Kavanaugh after claiming he was gonna vote for him. Now heís out saying, ìHeís too partisan for me. I donítÖ (sputtering) I donít want that on the court. I donít think we can do that.îFlake is demonstrating that his name is actually an apt description of his personality. Now hereís Feinstein. He wanted a week! He wanted a week! Everybody agreed to a week! And as predicted by me and many others, within hours of agreeing to one week the Democrats said, ìThatís not long enough,î and hereís DiFi. Take this from the top again. ìSenator Feinstein, would a floor vote Friday be too soon?îFEINSTEIN: Oh, I believe it is. I believe itís too soon.RUSH: Yes, oh yes.FEINSTEIN: Itís Tuesday, and, uh we have to put all the facts together.RUSH: We have.FEINSTEIN: Uhhh, umÖ And this isÖ I guess itís my tenth Supreme Court hearing that I sat on, and thereís never been one like this, with the issues like this.RUSH: Yes, there has.FEINSTEIN: And I donít take it lightly. So we need to do our due diligence.RUSH: Thatís not what youíre doing.FEINSTEIN: And there are other issues too. Thereís reproductive choice for women.RUSH: What!FEINSTEIN: Thereís presidential authority.RUSH: What!FEINSTEIN: Thereís an opinion that he wrote where he said in a D.C. assault weapons case that assault weapons could not be regulated because they were in common use.RUSH: What!FEINSTEIN: So thereís things like that that need to be looked at.RUSH: Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I thought the investigation was to look into whatís-her-face, Blasey Ford, maybe Ramirez, and at the outside, Swetnick. Theyíre all being looked into, and thereís nothing there, and so Friday? ìOh, itís way too soon. Besides, we gotta look into reproductive health because, you know, Brett Kavanaugh wants women to die! And Brett Kavanaugh this and Brett Kavanaugh that.î Thatís why I say, ìSomebody has gotta stand up and stop this.î Shut it down, because it isnít going to stop.It is never gonna be time to vote.Itís never gonna be time to end the investigation.It is never gonna be time to move this thing forward.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. So we just heard Dianne Feinstein say, ìWait a minute. We gotta go back and look at Kavanaughís rulings on Roe v. Wade and assault weapons.î What? What is that? You werenít able to stop him on those during all of your exhaustive hearings, so you went for rapist and you went for ice thrower, and now youíre back to saying his decisions pose a threat? Folks, it means theyíve got nothing on all this sex stuff, if DiFiís taking this back now to his danger represented by the decisions that heís made, which theyíve already been through inside out.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: CNN. This happened just before the conclusion of the previous hour, Iíd say 10 minutes ítil 1, CNN aired this.JOHN KING: There are some Republicans who say if Kavanaugh went down, if he was defeated or was forced to withdraw, that that would just gin up Republican turnout because the court is their Holy Grail and they would come rushing out. Hereís Rush Limbaugh saying donít bet on it.RUSH ARCHIVE: [I]tís very easy to sit here and say ó in the midst of this all this Democrat trickery ó that itís gonna fire people up on the Republican side. ìTheyíre gonna be so ticked off and so mad, theyíre gonna show up and vote like theyíve never voted before.î But is that gonna be the attitude if heís not sworn in? Ö Because if that happens, that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in ó meaning he is not confirmed in the Senate ó do you think itís gonna be easy for the Republicans to say, ìDid you see what happened to Kavanaugh? Weíre in the majority, and we couldnít get him confirmed! You need to come out and vote for us!î How does that work?JOHN KING: ìHow does that work?î Pretty good point. I do think that thatís an important point, that if Kavanaugh goes down, it will be because moderate Republicans decided to not vote for him, and that could depress turnout in some ways. That could lead to a number of people saying, ìWhatís the point?îRUSH: The point I was making is, and Iíve been hearing this this from a lot of people, that if Kavanaugh goes down itís just gonna fire up troops because Republicans are seen trying to make it happen and if it goes peopleÖ. I understand the thinking, but it just flies in the face of human nature. Beyond that, why do we have to lose in order to win? I never understood that. Why do we have to lose Kavanaugh in order to gin up turnout?Depending on how it would happen, Iím not sure it would gin up turnout anyway. You got the majority party saying they couldnít get their nominee confirmed and they go to voters say, weíre the majority and we tried we tried but we couldnít get íem confirmed, you need to vote for us and you need to give us more Republicans in theÖ Thereís a disconnect there.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. Back to the phones we go. Weíll cram our next exciting phone call into our remaining moments here. Auburn, Washington. Kirk. Itís great to have you, sir. How are you?CALLER: Mega dittos, Rush. Iím doing okay.RUSH: Good, good, good.CALLER: I just wanted to talk about the two people we gotta worry about about credibility here are Ford and Kavanaugh. Okay? So Ford. You have to believe that Ford would leave her best girlfriend alone with four boys ó two of which just sexually assaulted her ó without attempting to get her friend out of the house or even talking to her friend about it later. Or youíve got Kavanaugh who the U.S. government trusted so much, they trusted him with the nuclear launch codes under G. W. Bush.RUSH: Well, you know, you may have a point there. That is one of the jobs of the White House staff secretary, which Kavanaugh was for George W. Bush.CALLER: Well, Kavanaugh actually even mentioned that in the hearings.RUSH: So youÖ Yeah, and you cannot carry the suitcase, the football, the nuclear codes without having a very, very high clearance. Thatís a good point. I had missed him saying that.CALLER: Yeah. It was almost a throwaway line. I think it was in his opening statement where he was really sticking it to íem.RUSH: Kirk, thanks very much for that. I appreciate the call. As I say, folks, I get the impression here that the Democrats know this is kind of collapsing or falling apart on íem. When I heard Dianne Feinstein start talking about, ìWe need to look again at his rulings, Roe v. Wade, reproductive freedom, and, uh, and, uh, assault weapons.î Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I thought this was about gang rape and throwing ice in a bar? I donít think theyíve got anything here. Of all these witnesses, none of them apparently have any evidence corroborating witnesses of the sort.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I need to go back. I need to filed Sheldon Whitehouse. Here it is. No. 9. Sheldon Whitehouse. This guyís funny. This was the Democrat who on Friday morning, the morning of the vote, held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaughís calendar and said that he had figured out how to translate it.The date in question, he figured out, could be the date where the incident Dr. Ford described happened. He sought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that Kavanaugh used on his calendar ó of course, in incriminating ways toward Kavanaugh. So on Good Morning America today, George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking to Sheldon Whitehouse. Heís a Democrat from Rhode Island. He said, ìAre you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry? Can they finish this by Friday?îWHITEHOUSE: I think Iím satisfied. We donít know, uh, all the details yet, but clearly if they have been given free rein to interview whomever they want then thatís a very good sign. The last thing we want is a sham investigation. I also think that thereís a fairly small universe of witnesses here and a very big FBI. So yes, I think they probably should be able to, uhh, get this done by Friday if they really, uhhh, put the effort into it.RUSH: Now, wait a minute. That just makes too much sense. That just doesnít fit with Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate ó who we have. Grab audio sound bite No. 8. This is Chuck You. He went to the floor right after the Turtle did and basically made the case that weíre nowhere near ending this FBI investigation. As the Turtle said, Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts.SCHUMER: We are looking at what Judge Kavanaugh says at age 53, not what he did at age 18. We are looking at his credibility now as a grown adult, and if you believe Dr. Ford, then Judge Kavanaugh is not telling the truth. Just yesterday, NBC News reported that either Judge Kavanaugh or people close to the judge were in communication with his Yale classmates to get them to rebut allegations by Deborah Ramirez. Ö It seems that Judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about Miss. Ramirezís story.RUSH: So now itís about Kavanaugh lying? Itís about Kavanaugh perjuring himself, and that means heís not qualified? Theyíve gotta make up their minds! First, heís a serial gang rapist. Next, he throws ice on people at a bar. Then heís a fall-down drunk, and now heís a liar. They are flailing. But Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his minority leader in the Senate, Chuck You Schumer. ìYeah. I think Fridayís fine.ìYeah, thereís not too many people to talk to here! The FBIís got a lot of people. Sure we can get this done.î Thatís just too sensible. Maybe Whitehouse is out there chucking the spear here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane. But they are moving the goalposts ó and yes, for delay ó but theyíre also trying to move the goalposts as a target where they can catch Kavanaugh in anything.Thereís one more that I want to play and Iím looking for it and I just found it. I want you to go to audio sound bite No. 12. The question of who leaked Dr. Fordís letter to Dianne Feinstein. You know, this business of leaking this letter, my memory on this is kind of fuzzy. But I remember Feinstein doing a press conference either on the floor or at the Judiciary Committee. I remember her showing the letter holding it up or talking about it.I rememberÖ I donít know if that was the leak, but she clearly talked about it and said that sheíd had it since July and that she told us all about it that whoever had sent it didnít want to be named and didnít want to go forward. She didnít know what to do with it. Sheís holding this thing and saying, ìI donít know what to do with this.î It was all part of a strategy.So late yesterday afternoon on Sheppard Smith reporting on the Fox News Channel, Trace Gallagher was sitting in for Shep Smith. And he had the legal affairs correspondent for National Public Radio on there, Nina Totenberg. He said, ìMitch McConnell said Friday he thinks the Democrats wonít agree to a limited scope in the FBI investigation. Now today, theyíre asking for 24 more witnesses to be interviewed! What are your thoughts on that, Ms. Totenberg?îTOTENBERG: I remember when I broke the Anita Hill story, I thought this was the closest kept secret, and I managed to f-find out about it. I later found out there were probably a hundred people in Washington who knew this secret and kept it for a very long time. You and I are not stupid people.GALLAGHER: Right!TOTENBERG: We may not be brilliant, but weíre not stupid. And once you get us on a case like that, and lots of people are talking to each other, one leads to another. And it doesnít have to be a member of the Senate who leaked this.GALLAGHER: Yuh.TOTENBERG: It doesnít even have to be a staffer who leaked this! It doesnít have to be a member of her law firm! It just seeps out, and thatís what happened here.RUSH: Why didnít I think of that? ìIt just seeps out,î kind of like itís in a pressure cooker and after a while, the pressure cooker develops a seeping leak, and here comes the news of the letter. A hundred people must have known about this! A hundred people knew about Anita Hill, but they waited ítil the last minute to try that too. So sheís running interference for Dianne Feinstein. Believe me, theyíre buddies.Nina Totenberg, Dianne Feinstein, NPR, the Drive-By Media, the Democrat Party, theyíre buddies. So sheís doing a CYA for Feinstein here. (impression) ìWell, you know, a lot of people knew about it and more people know about it and it just kind of seeps out there.î (chuckles) Somebody ìseepedî it. Whether you want to change the term to ìseepî from ìleak,î somebody did it. It didnít just leak out on its own. But thatís what Totenberg wants you to think happened here.  "

What is the lead headline on the Drudge Report? Let me read it to you: ìWhite House Expands FBI Probe.î I said, ìWhat the hell is that?î So I clicked on the link. Hereís what it is. (shuffling papers) Right here my formerly nicotine-stained fingers. Itís the New York Times working in tandem with NBC News. Headline: ìWhite House Tells FBI to Interview Anyone Necessary for Kavanaugh Inquiry.îThis is because of what they claim Trump said at his press conference today where he said, ìNo, I donít want to limit anything.î They run a fake news story, NBC does, claiming Trumpís limiting the investigation. He says, ìNo, Iím not. Thatís fake news.î So then theyíve got it on record, ìTrump Not Limiting Investigation,î which means it can go on and on and on and on, and now theyíre broadcasting everywhere: ìWhite House Tells FBI to Interview Anyone NecessaryÖîRight on schedule, CNN reports that the Democrats have submitted a list of 24 people they want the FBI to talk to. This after Fox News had it earlier today that the FBIís about to wrap up tomorrow. This is gonna have to be shut down at some point. This cannot go on. All this is, is delay, delay, delay, delay, and Iím gonna tell you what needs to happen. There is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down, and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient, is somehow incomplete.Somebody needs to be stand up and say, ìItís the exact opposite, that this is the seventh investigation.î Now, Trump has, but somebody besides him needs to make the point that this has been a thorough investigation, that every last minute jack-in-the-box thatís popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made. But thereís only so much you can do with a woman who doesnít remember where or when whatever happened to her happened.And thereís only so much you can do when the people in the room she says were there claim they werenít! This investigation, somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it! Somebody needs to stand up and promote it! It needs to be spoken for! This has got to be stopped! Because itís not real. The Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go, submit names they want the FBI to talk to? Investigations donít work that way!The FBI follows evidence, leads, and when they donít find anything, unlike Bob Mueller, they stop! Muellerís been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and hasnít found any. But heís still going. And thatís exactly what this is gonna be if somebody doesnít stand up and stop this! Somebody on the Senate Judiciary Committee needs to stand up ó or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up ó and start vouching for the investigation that he says has taken place.There are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh. Somebody needs to speak up for íem. Somebody needs to vouch for íem. Somebody needs to stand up and say, ìThey have been thorough and they havenít found anything or he wouldnít be where he is now sitting on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals!î But thatís not happening! Somehow weíre letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here into Kavanaugh has been half-baked, lukewarm, and incompetent because of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence, no corroboration, and nothing.Yet sheís incredible; Kavanaughís not. Look, we had a caller earlier, ìHow do you stop a bully? You smack íem in the face.î Somebody needs to stand up and tell the Democrats to shut the hell up, that theyíve gotten everything theyíve asked for in this case and there just isnít anything there, and to go home. The idea this investigation is not thorough, is incompetent, is incomplete, or has been rigged is absolutely bogus. Now, there making things up, that Trump is gonna limit it.He did no such thing, but he sure fell for the bait. ìIím not limiting anything. Iíve told the FBI to take this wherever it takes them.î Promptly, Democrats say, ìWell, hereís 24 people we want you to talk to.î What if you called the FBI and said, ìThereís some people in my town here really, really screwing the pooch and I need to get something done about it and hereís the number, ìwould you go and talk to íem?î (Snort!) It doesnít work that way, does it?ìBut, Rush! But, Rush! This is the United States Senate. Clearly they can have theÖî No. Itís notÖ (sigh) One other thing. You know, one of the movies I have recommended over the years that people rent if they havenít seen and watched it is called The Lives of Others. Itís a movie about East Germany during the Cold War, essentially how the government literally spied on every citizen. The German chancellor at the time was Erich Honecker.Heís the guy that, you know, drugged the East German women, Olympic teams. Anyway, itís a frightening movie in terms of what a gigantic police state with the ability and power to spy on people creates. Well, I have here a tweet from none other than Jane Mayer whoís done her level best to destroy Clarence Thomas, writing books about the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas thing. She tried to blame the TV show 24 for torture at Abu Ghraib and Club Gitmo! She blamed a TV show for inspiring torture in the United States military!And now instead of the lives of other others now weíre gonna weaponize college friendships. Here is the tweet: ìIf you knew Brett #Kavanaugh at @Yale and have any relevant information about him, please send a text to @NewYorkerís @JaneMayerNYer í77,î ícause sheís a Yale graduate 1977, and thereís her phone number here. ìPlease RT.î So sheís out soliciting from anybody who could say, ìYeah, I knew Kavanaugh!ìI saw Kavanaugh. I didnít know him but I saw Kavanaugh. He could barely stand up! Every Friday this guy would beating people up and they were going to hospital.î You saw that? ìYes, I did. I saw that.î It doesnít need to be true. She just needs to able to say somebody somebody told her. ìOops! We got another allegation we gotta track down.î This is how this is all going, until somebody stands up and says this is it and starts vouching for the investigation thatís taken place.Isnít that what Rosenstein and McCabe and Strzok Smirk and Mueller and all these people say? Arenít they out there vouching for their investigation into Trump? Isnít the media telling us every day itís thorough and itís continuing to look and all this sort of stuff? Weíre not allowed to think that investigationís flawed in any way. But this one? ìYeah, this is all rigged. Yeah, this? They ó they ó theyíre ignoring things. Eh, they donít care to find out what happened to Christine Ford. BS!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: And thereís one other thing today that has been bothering me ever since I saw it, and that is this report first on the Fox Business Channel and then Fox News that the FBI says that theyíre about ready to wrap up their investigation, may have it wrapped up tomorrow. Folks, the FBI would never say this! The FBI doesnít announce when theyíre gonna end things. They donít even tell you when theyíve started something. So what the hell is this?I mean, even if itís true, they wouldnít announce, ìHey, weíre gonna have this wrapped up.î They wouldnít go to the media and say this unlessÖ Unless itís somebody at the FBI who want the media to say itís over tomorrow so that the media can say the fix is in. Because the big news of the day is that Trump supposedly said that the investigation can be widened. The New York Times has it. Now here comes a story that the FBIís finished, wrapped up tomorrow? Donít buy it. Donít believe it.  "

Will, glad you called, sir. Whatís happening?CALLER: Thank you, Rush. Itís a pleasure to be here. I wanted to get your thoughts on the ethical issues of the GoFundMe page. If you recall during Dr. Fordís testimony, the prosecutor asked her how she was paying for the legal feels and her security. She mentioned her GoFundMe page. Those three pages have raised close to a million dollars, and there has to be some kind of ethical issue. You could just accuse somebody without any kind of corroborating evidence and then go public with that and raise, you know, that amount of money is a very, very troubling thought. Thereís a lot of weird incentives there for people to make cross accusations if they think they could raise, you know, a lot of money via crowdsourcing.RUSH: Look, this is a toughie. In a strict capitalist sense, she has identified a market, and that is there are deranged lunatics who want her to be right, who hope sheís telling the truth. They want her to continue to speak intelligently. They want her lawyers to continue to strategize and screw Kavanaugh. Theyíre happy to pay for it. This is how they can be involved in politics beyond voting! Theyíre more than happy to pay.It doesnít matter to them that she can afford her lawyers herself. It doesnít matter to them that her lawyers are working pro bono because this is a political case so sheís identified a market. There are people that want to support her with money; so she starts the GoFundMe page. I actually think somebody sent me a note today that GoFundMe is now the new money laundering, essentially money-laundering operation for the Democrats much like the unions were, because whereís a lot of this money gonna go?A lot of this money is gonna go to these two lawyers who are then gonna beÖ Well theyíre already involved in Democrat Party politics. So itís a new form of fundraising thatís not called fundraising. This was made to look like people supporting a bedraggled and falsely accused, uh, uh, stressful, uh, really in bad shape woman who can barely, barely get through the hearing. (Impression of Christine Blasey Ford) ìOh, Iím terrified!î Theyíre happy to help. Sheís not the only one using it for this. Thereís a lot of Republicans, a lot of people who are using GoFundMe pages to raise money for their legal bills and other expenses.If you can convince the American people to support you, well, I mean, I donít think thereís anything in media that could be done to stop it, and I donít think that you can draw any conclusions about her from it in terms of whether sheís being truthful or not. If you wanted to draw a conclusion that the GoFundMe page is a way to get Democrat suckers (i.e., voters) to pay for this so that it doesnít cost people who already have a lot of money anything, then you could try to make that point, that the Democrats are using these poor people. But, I donít think youíre gonna be able to find a way to stop this. Itís too widely used.  "

Part of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination, and here we are. Democrats are gonna make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy, and they think that they can last through 2020. So theyíre not really pressing the issue as hard as what Republicans could, knowing that if we want to get our guy in there, you know, weíre gonna have to show up in the midterms. Theyíre gonna have an adverse effect if they keep delaying this.RUSH: Iíve heard people say this. Jason here thinks that all of this is gonna backfire on the Democrats and motivate Republicans to show up and vote. Not just now, 2018, but again for Trump in 2020. Letís go to the audio sound bites on this. Jason, thank you much. Weíre gonna start here. This is Fox & Friends Weekend on Saturday morning. Rachel Campos-Duffy, who is one of the hosts, is talking to CBN political correspondent David Brody about all this. And she says, ìWell, we know the Democrats have already been really energized about the midterms. I donít know how much more energized they could get. But Iím sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week. This hearing has really fired the Republicans up.îBRODY: From my reporting and from that deplorable evangelical base, I can tell you they say the Democratsí dirty tricks have riled them up like never before. I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed itís gonna be real tough for the Republicans. Actually, if Kavanaugh is not confirmed, that would even rile up that deplorable evangelical base ó and the GOP base ó I believe even more, at least for people that Iím hearing from. And so, look, I think thatís a big part of whatís going on here.RUSH: Now, look, you canít blame David Brody for being 50% informed because I pulled back that original prediction after it had gone viral all over the Drive-By Media. Thatís why itís still prominent in peopleís minds. And my retraction of that prediction has barely received any whimper because it doesnít serve the Drive-Bys any good. When the Drive-Bys hear me predicting Republican doom, they canít help themselves. They gotta put it all over the world in the media.ìRush Limbaugh says Republicans guaranteed to lose House if Kavanaugh not confirmed.î That prediction was based at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved. If the Republicans didnít fight for Kavanaugh. If the Republicans just whimpered out, I predicted that would happen. But once this began to unfold, I retracted that prediction and said it could end up being the opposite here. But of course that prediction didnít go viral. And Jason in Muskegon, I want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case. Here is one more bias on this.This is C-SPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning. Jesse Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard, Andrew Egger, about me.HOLLAND: There several conservatives including Rush Limbaugh who warn that Republicans could lose their majority if they donít get Kavanaugh confirmed to the Supreme Court. Is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about, midterm consequences?EGGER: Arguments like the one that Limbaugh makes are a little convenient. Uh, whether or not Kavanaugh gets through, I think this whole situation has really fired up Republican voters.RUSH: Once again, somebody elseÖ You canít blame íem, folks. Donít get mad at íem, because my original prediction was everywhere, literally all over the place. It was on Saudi TV. It was on the BBC. It was on Russian television. I think even the North Koreans had it. The little pot-bellied dictator mentioned it in his Saturday night message to the people. It was everywhere. When Rush Limbaugh says, ìRepublicans are gonna take it in the shorts,î everybody in the media covers it.Again, I made that prediction at a time where it looked like they were getting ready to bail on the entire nomination. When that didnít happen, when the Democrats went a couple of steps too far and caused the Republicans to engage them in this, then I revised the prediction.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Jeff in Sarasota, Florida. Hi. Great to have you here, sir. Whatís up?CALLER: Hi, Rush. Just wanted to make a suggestion or an idea. Itís kind of a fantasy. It would ever work but, you know, the left has always behaved like bullies, and theyíll do anything, and theyíve never had real pushback from our representatives on the right in Washington. So, you know, when you have no ethics and your dirty tactics pay off and they have benefits for you coupled with the fact that, you know, you never have to suffer consequences on yourself? Itís like a bully. Thereís no reason to stop. When your tactics work thereís no reason to stop.RUSH: Exactly.CALLER: No bully has ever stopped until they get punched in the mouth.RUSH: Exactly.CALLER: Maybe itís time that, you know, we donít want to become them, but maybe letís for a year letís become them. Letís show them that anything destructive they can do to other human beings, it can óRUSH: Now, wait a minute. You know, one thing. I reject this whole argumentÖ By the way, I donít disagree with you. I reject this argument. We donít have to becomeÖ Did we have to become Hitler to beat Hitler? Did we have to become the emperor to beat the Japanese? No. Decency can beat these people. Itís just that decent people are not conditioned and primed for it every day. When youíre up against indecency, a lot of decent people donít know what to do about it. But smash-mouth is right. Doing what they do? Maybe itís time.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, folks, one other thing here. We just had a caller who said that we donít want to become them, but itís time to start playing this game the way they do. I made the point you donít have to become them to beat them at this game. We didnít have to become Hitler to win World War II. We didnít have to become the Japanese emperor to win World War II in the Pacific Theater. Thatís always been a bogus thing. ìWe cannot go after these people at the risk of becoming who they are.îWhat a crock. Thatís nothing more than some limitation thatís in utter denial of people who are already found to be of a fine character. You can enter into tough battles without losing your morality and your moral character and so forth. But as an example of how we almost do it now and then but then we pull back, I call your attention last week to when Lindsey Graham unloaded on the Democrats. He unloaded on íem, and he was a thousand percent right in every allegation he made.A couple other Republicans echoed Graham but with no passion and with no energy. They just echoed what Graham said intellectually. Now, according to our caller, that should have been the starting point! People should have been picked up on Grahamís opener and run with it, and it should have become the daily identifier of the Republican Party. They should have been throwing back, firing back right at the Democrats in their faces every hour of every day. Itís exactly what Graham did.Make that the ongoing battle. Put them on the defensive, make the media repeat these charges that Graham laid out. But instead, it was a standalone. Graham said it ó it was great, it was impassioned ó and that was the end of it. It was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican. So Grahamís impassioned allegation of the Democrats was followed by agreement with Jeff Flakeís demand that the FBI be allowed to do one more week of investigation, thereby nullifying Senator Grahamís point.He even went along with Flake. You canít do these things as one-offs. If youíre gonna tell people who the Democrats are, if youíre gonna try to inform the country whatís really going on here, you have to do it every day, and youíre gonna have to do it multiple times a day. Itís gonna have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day-to-day basis. But it never does. Weíve had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republican has done a one-off like that and itís been great and we have celebrated it, and weíve cheered it. ìWay to go!îAnd it dies, except for here on talk radio or maybe on Fox News. But it dies. Well, Lindsey Graham didnít have to become them to do what he did. He just had to be honest, and he was. Lindsey Graham didnít have to worry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people. And, by the way, did you notice not a one of them on the Democrat side cared a whit about what Graham said? None of them even got mad at it.Not a single one of them even wanted to refute it. They didnít care. The only thing got a rise out of them was when Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter. So she turned around and asked her staff, ìDid you guys leak it? No, they said they didnít leak it, Mr. Chairman. We didnít leak it. I just asked my staff. They said they didnít.î Oh, what about an investigation, huh? Well, Tom Cotton says weíre gonna investigate Feinstein, and weíre gonna investigate some of these other things.That needs to be followed up on! There needs to be follow-through. But I, for oneÖ I know investigations are necessary, but Iím getting tired of íem ícause all they are is further delay. How hard is it after on stand up and say, ìBrett Kavanaugh is credible in his denialî? Why is that so hard? She doesnít have any evidence! ìBut she made a credible witness.î How? ìWell, she was really suffering and in pain.î So? None of that establishes credibility.An attitude doesnít give us credibility. Pain and suffering doesnít equal credibility. Democrats are always in pain and suffering over something. Now, I want to go back to my prediction. My original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this, if they donít vote out Kavanaugh in that committee ó if he doesnít get voted on, if heís not confirmed ó the Republicans are gonna have hell to pay because voters are going to be fit to be tied with being let down again.Then the Democrats kept pulling stunts, and it became conventional wisdom. ìIf this keeps up, Republican voters are gonna get so ticked off! Republican women and mothers are gonna get so mad, ícause theyíve got sons and they hate seeing whatís happening to Kavanaugh. They donít want to imagine it happening to their own kid. Theyíre gonna show up in droves!î Well, I want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something.If Brett KavanaughÖ Just think about this as a hypothetical. Iím not predicting it. If Brett Kavanaugh is not sworn in early next week ó if you can hypothetically envision the day where Kavanaugh is not confirmed, not sworn in, are you gonna be fit to be tied? Are you gonna be so mad that you canít wait to vote, or are you gonna be so mad that you feel betrayed?Because if that happens, that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in ó meaning he is not confirmed in the Senate ó do you think itís gonna be easy for the Republicans to say, ìDid you see what happened to Kavanaugh? Weíre in the majority, and we couldnít get him confirmed! You need to come out and vote for us!î How does that work? Thatís gonna be pretty difficult.Asking Republicans to come out and vote to keep the majority when Kavanaughís not sworn in? Everybody thinks that what voters are gonna remember in November is this, the unfairness to Kavanaugh, the dirty tricks the Democrats are playing. But stop and think. Kavanaugh is not sworn in, and the Republicans think, ìWow, weíre set up now, man!ìTheyíre so mad out there, weíre guaranteed to get their votes. Thereís gonna be a Republican wave ícause of what happened to Kavanaugh,î and then the Republicans start campaigning, and they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kavanaugh. ìOh, you mean that heís not there? You mean he didnít get sworn in? Youíre the majority. We know itís very small majority, but youíre the majority, and heís not sworn in, and you want us toÖ?îHow does this work, folks? My point is itís very easy to sit here and say ó in the midst of this all this Democrat trickery ó that itís gonna fire people up on the Republican side. ìTheyíre gonna be so ticked off and so mad, theyíre gonna show up and vote like theyíve never voted before.î But is that gonna be the attitude if heís not sworn in?Republicans have been asking for the majority for a long time. They keep working and voting mostly because of Trump, voters do. They keep showing up because of Trump. Trump alone will be able to make the case. Trump alone will be able to turn a Kavanaugh defeat into turnout. But Republicans in the Senate and the House? I donít know how they do it. ìVote for us, Kavanaugh was defeatedî? ìVote for us so it doesnít happen to the next nomineeî?Is that really effective? See, I just donítÖ I hear too many people talking about this. It seems like every time you want a big turnout, we have to lose something so that people get fired up. Iíve been hearing this since Iíve been doing this show. Back in 1992, people called here and said, ìRush, Clinton needs to win. Then people will see how bad the Democrats really are. People will see what skunks they really are.î Iíd say, ìAre you kidding? We lose and then tell ourselves weíre gonna win?îWeíre still doing it here with Kavanaugh. So Kavanaugh doesnít make it. This is gonna really fire people up? Why do we have to lose to fire up the base? That doesnít make any sense to me! It ought to be the other way around. This is another trick I think that gets played on Republicans. ìYour base is gonna be really fired up if Kavanaugh doesnít make it.î Wait a minute.The Republicans are the majority. How in the hell is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesnít make it? ìWell, Rush, voters are gonna be so mad.î Yeah. At what? The guy got railroaded and our guys couldnít stop it and weíre supposed to say, ìWell, okay, man, weíre really loaded now. Thatís gonna really cause the turnup to spike up!î Sorry, folks. I donít think it works that way. What peopleÖ?In the hypothetical I just gave you, whatís gonna happen is that voters are gonna be out there saying, ìEven when we vote Republican, the Democrats still run the town,î and it doesnít equal show up; keep electing Republicans. Gotta be the other way. Got to win this! Weíve got to beat the Democrats, not lose to them! By the way, Iíve had a lot of emails from a lot of people who think theyíre expert political analysts, and they allÖWell, not all, but a whole bunch of íem have this theory that the way to get the base all firedÖ We want to let them destroy a great life, a great patriot, a great American ó his whole career, his future, maybe his family ó in order to win the midterms? How does that work? Your football team loses. Does that make you want to become a season ticket holder, or is it when they win that you want on the bandwagon and you want to be on the team?Why do we have to keep losing to fire up our base?You talk about a trap?If you ask me, the mediaís behind that, the Democrats, the Washington establishment.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This is Sharon inÖ This canítÖ Lititz, Pennsylvania? How do you pronounce where you are?CALLER: Itís Lititz.RUSH: Lititz. Good.CALLER: Yes, sir.RUSH: Whatís happening?CALLER: Hi, Rush. Thank you for taking my call.RUSH: You bet.CALLER: Iíve been curious about since about the beginning of this year, several times you mentioned that an incident or an occurrence has yet to happen that will affect or seriously affect the midterms. I was curious to hear if you think this Kavanaugh nomination thatís gone sour is that incident.RUSH: Well, it could be, but the point was, I didnít have anything specific in mind. Itís just that we get a poll in June or a poll in May or even July, and it tells us what the public is thinking of doing in the November elections. My point was: This is silly. This poll doesnít mean anything. Does anybody remember the poll in July of 2016 or in August? It doesnít mean anything ícause itís not when the election is. And I said the events are gonna shape the midterms havenít happened yet. I said that in July, August, September. And this is exactly the kind of thing I had in mind. But thereís gonna be something beyond this.CALLER: Oh, dear.RUSH: This is gonna get resolved one way or the other, and depending on how itís resolved, yeah, itís going to affect turnout. Itís going to affect votes. If the Democrats lose this, if Kavanaugh gets confirmed, then, you know, what are Democrat voters gonna do? Theyíre just gonna be really enraged and show up and vote or are they gonna be mad, depressed, and sit at home? Who knows? But this thing is gonna get resolved. If this is not resolved before the election then itís a defeat anyway because all the Democrats want here is delay, delay, delay.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: But my only point was those polls in the summer are largely irrelevant because there are things that are gonna happen much closer to the election that nobody can predict that are gonna have a great impact on it. This is one of those things, yes. But I donít know if itís the final one.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: For example, who would have predicted back in July or August that weíd be done with NAFTA, weíd have a brand-new trade deal that gets rid of the horrible aspects of NAFTA, and have a new trade deal thatís pro-America? And then after that, how many people think that that is instrumental in voter turnout, hmm? What do you think?  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/01/rachel-mitchells-devastating-report-on-blasey-ford/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 1, 2018RUSH: I mentioned that we have a poll here from Mark Penn, and the headline of the piece (itís an op-ed that heís written at TheHill.com) is, ìKavanaugh Polling: FBI on the Hot Seat.î The upshot of this is ìAmericans believe Christine Blasey Ford. And most also believe Brett Kavanaugh. Ö If the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges,î and there wonít be any corroboration of the charges, unless somebody does what this whole thing has been from the get-go and makes it up. I put nothing past the Democrats.Everything that we saw on Friday was orchestrated. It was the biggest mistake in the world. Maybe itís Senate tradition; I donít know. I havenít seen enough committee hearings. I donít know if on the day of a committee vote on anything every senator gets to speechify and that that takes four hours. The Judiciary Committee meeting was scheduled for 9:30. Everybody thought that was the vote. But, no, Grassley announced the Democrats wanted to speak, and they did, and they all kept harping on an FBI investigation. It wasnít fair.And we know what happened, and at one point Flake disappears. Nobody knows where he went, after he was harassed by a bunch of political activists and a CNN camera in an elevator, the Senate office building. The whole thing was orchestrated and pulled off. And I think the Republicans know all of this. I think the Republicans are not dumb. The Republicans are not blind. Theyíve had too many years of watching how the Democrats operate not to know something was coming.There just wasnít the will to stop it, ícause the Republicans need to be seen bending over every which way possible to accommodate the credible testimony of Christine Blasey Ford. It was not credible! It isnít credible today! How does this work? Any woman comes forth, says anything she wants, itís automatically credible. The accused, who denies it, is not credible? The fix is in from the get go on all this! She doesnít knowÖBy the way, Rachel Mitchell, the Republican sex crimes prosecutor from Arizona that they hired to question Blasey Ford on Thursday, whenever was it, has put together her review of Christine Blasey Ford and itís devastating. It is documented devastating. She has no reason to be believed. She can offer no reason. She doesnít even offer consistency. Thereís even a little story thatís developed about her use of Safeway, that she shopped in Safeway a lot, and that was new.The theory behind that is Mark Judge wrote a book. As part of his therapy for alcohol and drug abuse, he was told to write a book. It was supposedÖ It was a fictional book. It was an aid, an attempt to help him through his problem. It was not a memoir. In this book, it talks about Safeway a lot, and he works there, did work there. So she automatically places herself at a Safeway where he is! Rachel Mitchell found this highly suspicious and, like much else that she said, impossible to prove. Her reportÖI mean, I printed it out. Itís like six pages here. It is devastating: The inconsistencies in her stories, the variables in her story, the fact that none of the stuff that matters can be proven, the fact that the people she said were in the room donítÖ The number kept changing from the original letter to subsequent interviews and then to the testimony she had. The idea that she was afraid to fly and yet here she is vacationing all over the world.How did she get there? The idea that she refused to talk to the committee even in California. We learned that she didnít even know the committee had offered to fly out there because her lawyers didnít tell her. By the way, a couple of Republicans are now demanding an investigation. Tom Cotton says, ìWeíre gonna investigate Feinstein. Weíre gonna investigate this leak and weíre gonna investigate these lawyers who may not have told her that the committee was willing to go out there because they believed that she was afraid to fly.îNone of this was true. So the idea is thatÖ Sheís the least credible witness in all of this, and yet there she is automatically said to be credible. Every leftist supposedly reviewing her performance says, ìI found her credible.î Based on what? ìShe was in such pain. She was so, so still shaken by what happened all of those years ago. You could see it.î Yeah, because she really knew how to make it look like that. I donít thinkÖ For me, I donít think any of this has been genuine.I think itís all orchestrated. I think a lot of itís focus grouped. I think itís scripted, because none of this passes any kind of a smell test. Anyway, back to Mark Pennís poll, very quickly. ìAmericans believe Christine Blasey Ford. And most also believe Brett Kavanaugh. Ö If the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges, 60% believe that Kavanaugh should then be confirmed, according to a weekend Harvard CAPS/Harris poll of 1,330 registered voters. ÖìSixty-six percent of Americans support that decisionî to have the FBI investigate, ìand that includes 80% of Democrats, 69% of independents but only 45% of Republicans,î who are the smart ones. ìHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about it, and 40% thought she alone was credible, 23% thought just Kavanaugh was, and 27% said both were believable.î If you combine all of that, ìthe poll findings indicate that 67% found her credible and 50% found him to be so. ÖìBut the credibility of their testimony does not appear to be the decisive factor. Rather, the question comes down to corroboration as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should ascend to the high court. In terms of the overall needle, after the testimony was heard, 37% say confirm the nomination, 44% say reject it, and 18% remain undecided, with Democrats going one way and Republicans the other. ButÖîBut! But! But! But! Hang on. Donít get depressed. ìBut once the voters are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation, this shifts [from 37%] to 57% who favor confirmation,î meaning the people in this poll do not know, did not know ó many of them did not know ó that the people she places in the room have denied being there. When the pollsters told them that fact, the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jump from 37 to 57%.ì[A]nd that goes up to 60%î in the hypothetical question, ìif the FBI [after a week] agrees there is no corroborationî for her story ó and theyíve already done that. But now weíve got Comey entering the picture. Now we got Comey urging the FBI to keep digging ó the same FBI thatís been running a silent coup, FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Hereís Christie in Durant, Iowa.

And I donít know if anybody has brought this up or not, but Iíve been thinking about this forever and ever and Iím so glad I got to ask you about it just in case you have brought it up. But has anybody ever thought that the reason she looked so credible because she was so emotional and, you know, wimping and nearly jumping out of her skin is because she freaking went on national TV? She was convinced to go on national TV to continue a lie that is this horrible? Have you ever had someone lie to you and theyíre kind of a little nervous and shaky?RUSH: See?

Your voice might be shaky and you might be forgetful and you might be nervous and jittery and so forth. For people untrained in this kind of thing, yeah. But I donít buy that thatís who she is for a minute.I think this was rehearsed and scripted. She knew what she was gonna say and so forth. I think it was practiced. (sigh) Sheís from Palo Alto. These people are left-wing activists. Now, I donít want to appear to just out-of-hand reject your theory. I need to ask you a question. Honestly. Thereís no wrong answer here. Do not misinterpret any tone in my vice. Iím actually asking you to help me.CALLER: Okay.RUSH: Was she credible to you because of her demeanor and her voice and her up-speaking technique and her apparent nervousness? Did she come across as credible to you? Believable?CALLER: No! Thatís exactly what I just said. She came across as someone who was sitting in front of a bunch of people telling a lie, and the reason why she was able to be whimpering and shaky and nervous and look like someone who had been raped is because she knew she was lying on national TV.RUSH: Okay. I heard that. I thought you said the reason she comes across as credible was because people identify with suffering and pain and all that.CALLER: Sheís whimpering and scared out of her mind because of what sheís doing.RUSH: WellÖ (sigh)CALLER: And she was convinced to do something really stupid.RUSH: Sheíd have to have a conscience for that.

If I were participating in an effort that had an entire political party depending me to pull it off, to destroy another human being, if it werenít true, I couldnít do it ó and I donít think they have any problem doing it.

He talked about Blumenthal lying for years about having served in Vietnam when he had never even been to the country, served with valor as a Marine. He said this guy ó a serial liar on his own resume ó is questioning Brett Kavanaugh?He went to talk about Cory Booker who has admitted to fondling women in anÖ By the way, that was an attempt to cleanse himself, to show that he has reformed when he did that. He went out and he accused Feinstein ó sort of quasi-accused her ó of leaking the Christine Blasey Ford letter. He did this Saturday night in West Virginia, and it was hilarious the way he thinks he knows that Dianne Feinstein leaked.I donít have time to explain it. Iím gonna have to show it. For those of you watching on the Dittocam, Iíll do my best to show you what Trump did. He imitated Feinstein when the whole question of leaking came up. Now theyíre asking, ìIf itís proven that Kavanaugh was a drunk in high school, does that mean youíll pull the nomination?î and Trump is talking to them about that. So weíll keep going here.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So the president continues to take questions in the Rose Garden from the Drive-By Media. I would JIP it, but there are things I want to get to here, and I can just as easily relay what the president I ssaying. Heís just laying the Democrats out. Heís laying them out for the lying tricksters and skunks that they are. Heís linking the media to the Democrat Party, whichÖ We do it all the time here, but you donít really hear the president make it that direct and obvious.He has just eviscerated the credibility of all of these accusing Democrats, from Cory ìSpartacusî Booker, to Richard Blumenthal, to Dianne Feinstein. Now, what he did with FeinsteinÖ If youíll recall, is toward the tail end of the hearing on Friday, before the vote came, somebody raised a question of how in the world did Christine Blasey Fordís letter to Dianne Feinstein leak? Because it wasÖ We are made to understand that the letter said that she didnít want anybody to know her name and that she didnít want to come forward.Yet the woman had written the Washington Post! Sheíd called the Washington Post tip line, the New York Times. She has an op-ed published in the Washington Post. But all along weíre told she didnít want to go public. So people were trying to claimÖ You know, for all this talk about what Kavanaughís done to this poor woman, itís the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have put her through this (sobbing) ìemotional wringer. Itís so unfair and such spotlight.îIt became obvious that there could be only three sources for the leak because of limited possession of the letter. One would be Senator Feinstein and/or her staff. The other would have to be somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter. So some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein, and she sat there and fumed while this was happening.And as all the other possibilities were mentioned, she eventually asked for a point of order to Chairman Grassley and said (summarized), ìChairman Grassley, I need to react. I need to respond to this outrageous allegation that I or my staff had leaked this letter. Just for the record, I just asked my staff. I just asked my staff if any of them leaked it, and they have assured me that they didnít.î (Snort!) But what we saw when she was do, she turned around to her staff sitting behind her, and she starts mouthing.We canít hear what sheís saying ícause itís off mic, but sheís obviously asking them, ìDid anybody leak it?î She turns and asks, ìDid you leak it? Did you leak it?î She turns back to the camera, ìWe didnít leak it, Mr. Chairman. We didnít leak it.î Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday night by saying (summarized), ìOh, is this how weíre gonna determine who leaked something? She gets to turn to her staff and ask them, and they deny it, and thatís it?ìMeanwhile, Kavanaugh sits over there and has to undergo his seventh FBI background check. His accuser has no corroboration and no evidence, and heís presumed to have done it? And Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff, ëHey, did any of you leak this letter? and they get to say, ëOh, no, no! Wasnít us. Wasnít us.í And she turns back around and says, ëWe ó we didnít do it, Mr. Chairman,í as though, ëCase closed; it wasnít usí?îThey had to have done it. It was strategic! Just like what happened on Friday was strategic!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: To Trump sound bites. These are from the Oval Office. It was during an announcement ceremony for a new trade deal eliminating NAFTA, getting rid of it. Itís a brand-new trade deal. The Drive-Bys were under orders not to ask questions about Kavanaugh, which meant they asked questions about Kavanaugh. Trump, after making sure enough time was spent on NAFTA, started entertaining the questions and we have ó one, two, three. Weíve got four of them here. And here is TrumpÖ This is not actually in response to a question. Heís just riffing here during the ceremony talking about the midterm election, fake news, Kavanaugh things.THE PRESIDENT: We have Senate races that werenít even in play six months ago. As you know, there are a lot of repression (sic) polls or polls that arenít very accurate. We had areas and we had congressional seats, too, where I know itís gonna be a positive outcome. But you look at whatís going on, and it doesnít seem to broadcast that way. But I certainly had that with my election. They were telling me I was, you know, in trouble in certain states that I end up winning, like, in a landslide. And I knew I was gonna win them in a landslide, but they wouldnít report it that way. You know why? Fake news.RUSH: Now during the Q&A Cecilia Vega, ABC News White House correspondent, said, ìIn a tweet this weekend, you said itís incorrect to say that youíre limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh. But your own statement on Friday made it very clear. You said this investigation must be limited in scope. So which is it?THE PRESIDENT: This is our seventh investigation of a man who has reallyÖ You know you look at his life until this happened. What a change heís gone through, what his familyís gone through, the trauma, for a man thatís never had any accusation, anyÖ He never had a bad statement about him. I think was No. 1 in his class at Yale. He was No. 1 in his law school at Yale. And then what heís gone through over the last three weeks is incredible. So I want the FBI ó this is now their seventh investigation. So itís not like they, you know, just starting. I want them to do a very comprehensive investigation.RUSH: Let me explain that answer. These sound bites have gotta beÖ Yeah, itís No. 30 coming. Okay. When this whole FBI investigation started, everybody knowsÖ We heard Flake command a week for his vote, one week. So thatís how the committee vote ended, 11-10 in favor of Kavanaugh with the proviso that Flake was not gonna vote when the floor vote for final confirmation ítil the FBI had spent at least another week looking into this.So then NBC runs a story out of nowhere, fake news, claiming that the White House intends to limit the scope of the FBI. It was a setup. It was a trap. They laid a trap. NBC News ó which is complicit with the Democrat Party in most things ó laid a trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI scope. Because, you see, there are things to find, and Trump wants to cover it up. Donald Trump whoís had so much control over the FBI the last three years.Same FBI thatís been doing its level best to get Trump thrown out of office. Somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation. So Trump responds, ìIím not limiting the scope of anything. Iíve told the FBI to look at whatever they need to look at.î ìOh, okay. Thank you, Mr. President. So if it needs to go two weeks it can go two weeks; so the White House has claimed there ainít any limitations.îSee how this works? It was a trap, it was a setup, and Trump tweeted out that heís not limiting the scope; NBCís lying. Of course theyíre lying! It was a setup! And so now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business News that the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow. But then the question becomes, well, what to do with that. If FBI has finished talking to everybody they need to talk to, then what are the Republicans do with that?Do they hold on to it ítil Friday or do they move on it? Well, Iíll just tell you. If this ends tomorrow, if this is all accurate, the Democrats are gonna be fit to be tied that the thing didnít go on ítil Friday and theyíre gonna demand. Theyíre gonna start saying that this thing is rigged, they knew it was gonna be rigged, and theyíre gonna demand even most of your time to fix the fact that it was rigged. Theyíre gonna do that anyway.Theyíre not gonna let this thing end on Friday. If we let them have their way, this investigation isnít gonna end on Friday. It wonít be long enough. Besides, Trump said heís not gonna have any limit on the FBI. So why are they stopping now? It isnít possible they could have found everything there is to find on this, they will say. To which the response is, well, they found nothing in a hundred thousand or more Hillary emails in a couple days.Letís see. Letís skip forward here to audio sound bite No. 30. Reporter: ìAbout Judge Kavanaugh, there are concerns that he might have lied or mischaracterized his drinking while he was testifying. If they find that Kavanaugh lied about his drinking, or if he lied about other things, do you think that that bars him from being your nominee to the Supreme Court?îTHE PRESIDENT: I was surprised at how vocal he was about the fact that he likes beer, and heís had a little bit of difficulty. I mean, he talked about things that happened when he drank. This is not a man that said that alcohol was absent, that he was perfect with respect to alcohol. Look at some of these people asking the questions. Okay? Look at Blumenthal. He lied about Vietnam. He didnít just say, ìHey, I went to Vietnam.î No, no. For 15 years he said he was a war hero! He fought in Da Nang Province!We call him ìDa Nang Richard.î Da Nang! Thatís his nickname, Da Nang. He never went to Vietnam! Take a look Cory Booker. He ran Newark, New Jersey, into the ground. He was a horrible mayor. And he made statements that when he was in high school or college, what he was doing. He actually made the statements. And now heís talking about Judge Kavanaugh. And I could go through a whole list of them, okay? Look at Dianne Feinstein.RUSH: And he starts talking about Feinstein with the Chinese spy on her staff for 20 years, and then he tells the story about how Dianne Feinstein assured everybody that her staff didnít leak the Blasey Ford heard ícause right there in the middle of the hearing she turned around and asked íem. The camera was on her and she turned around and asked, ìDid you leak? Did you leak? Did you leak? Uh, Mr. Chairman, my staff tells me that we didnít leak it. I didnít leak it and my staff says they didnít leak it, so no, Mr. Chairman, we didnít leak it.îWell, then thatís that!Just like Kavanaugh says he didnít do what she says, but no, thatís not good enough! You need the FBI, you need everything you can get to find out if Kavanaughís lying. But weíre just supposed to sit there and accept Dianne Feinstein that you say and your staff say ó in a period of five to 10 seconds ó that you didnít like it? And thatís that? And Trump is so right about Richard Blumenthal. This guy, folks.. This guyÖ You know, I donít understand Democrat voters. It canít be on substance.This guy lied! He claimed for 15 years he was a medal-winning war hero, servitude with valor in Vietnam. Heís never been there. He had to call a press conference with tears to explain why and what happened. There is not a single Republican alive the media would allow to survive a transgression like that. Ann Coulter. Sheís got a really funny column, really great column. All the Democrats and media are saying, ìYou canít have 11 old white guys on that committee asking her questions and judging her.ìYou canít have that.î So she said (summarized), ìOkay. If you donít like the 11 old white guys, how about if we have Al Sharpton come in and ask questions, Al Sharpton of Tawana Brawley fame? How about we get Bill Cosby in there? Get another African-American. How about Keith Ellison. Get a Democrat, black guy in, a Democrat whoís got his own sexual harassment problems. How about Alton Maddox, attorney for black youth hired by a Jewish landlord?î She goes through a list of Latinos, Native Americans, and African-Americans who have abused women. ìLetís have them come in and ask the questions if these 11 white guys are incapable of it.î Really smart.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/28/flake-fears-realized/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 28, 2018RUSH: CNN is breathlessly reporting that Jeff Flake ó who announced he was gonna vote for Kavanaugh this morning ó walked out of the committee room today with Chris Coons, Democrat from Delaware, and hasnít been seen since. So CNNís trying to say that thereís a lot of drama being played out behind the scenes and that maybe Flake is going to get his mind changed by the Democrats. CNN is claiming Flake is wobbling, might still vote ìno.îThatís the current holdup in the voting right now.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We are keeping an eye on the committee. Theyíve not voted yet. Theyíre supposed to vote soon. Still some concern over where is Jeff Flake. CNN is breathless. CNN isÖOh, theyíre so hoping that somebody got to Flake. We, of course, are hoping itís wishful thinking. In the event somebody did ó and, by the way, let me justÖ I told Snerdley, I told the people on the other side of the glass 45 minutes ago that Iím not thinking this is over at all. Iím listening to these Democrat speeches where they are still campaigning, and then they get up and walk out. Every one of them is looking right at where Flake is sitting, either he or in Grassleyís direction.I told íem in there (and they can back this up) that I wouldnít be surprised if one of two things happened: If Grassley did decide to delay the vote or if Flake changed his mind. Snerdley looked at me and said, ìNo way! No way! Not after you commit. No way,î and now look what CNNís reporting. I know itís CNN, but somebodyís telling íem that. It could all be bogus, designed to be seen by others. (interruption) Right. ìTalks going on behind the scenes. Ö Drama playing out behind the scenes. Ö Dem, GOP members in talks.îWhat could that be about? If the Dems and the Republicans are in talks, the only reason to be talking (sigh) would be to change what was supposed to happen here at 1:30.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Yeah, all right. Itís confirmed the Democrats are really putting pressure on Flake. I was wise. I was wise to not trust this at the get go. I didnítÖ I didnít sayÖ Thereís a lot of things Iím holding back today, folks. Iím gonna tell you up front Iím holding back, because I donít want to end up being a factor in whatís happening here today. I donít mean to sound egotistical, but there are certain things that in this charged atmosphere, theyíre just waiting for someone like me to say something that would turn into a news story that would fire people up.So I have withheld what have been fears all day long about Flake. The minute I got here and found out this vote was gonna take four hours ó will have four hours of debate prior to it ó instead of happening at 9:30, and knowing that Flake is leavingÖ This is his last term in office. Knowing that Flake, at the end of the day, still does not like Donald Trump at all. Kavanaugh is a Trump nominee. The Democrats are now working hard to change him.Iíll guarantee you theyíre not talking about FBI investigations or fairness or any of that. Theyíre talking Trump. Amy Klobuchar set that up by saying that she doesnít think Kavanaughís qualified or legitimate simply because Trump nominated him. I think theyíre probably talking about Senator McCain to him. ìYou can be a hero like Senator McCain! Remember Senator McCain thumbing down Obamacare, the repeal of Obama? You can do the same!î I know theyíre working on him this way, and this was a fear I had from the get-go today.I mean, even from last night. Weíre talking about Jeff Flake here, maybe even a little bit Corker. Now, all of that having been said, McConnell has said that regardless, thereís gonna be a floor vote next week, and hereís another thing. Traditionally, the vote in the Judiciary Committee is supposed to serve as a guide to the full Senate. See, the full Senateís not on the Judiciary Committee, and so Civics 101 says, ìThe rest of the Senate will learn what to do by listening to the learned knowledge and recommendation of the Judiciary Committee, which will have fully vetted the nominee,î blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.I guarantee you that the other senators are not sitting out there waiting to hear what the Judiciary Committee recommends with its vote. So McConnell says thereís gonna be a vote regardless. Flakeís vote? Somebody is gonna be needed. If Flake drops off, weíre gonna need Collins, Murkowski, and so forth. McConnell says the vote is going to happen. In fact, our microphones are still there. Letís JIP a little bit of this. Grassley just resumed his seat here. Letís see whatís happening. We have a few moments here to find out.FLAKE: (haltingly) I, uh, have been speaking with a number of people on the other side. Weíve had conversations ongoing on for a while, uh, with regard to, um, making sure that (sigh) we do due diligence here.RUSH: Jeff Flake is speaking.FLAKE: And I think it would be, uh, proper to delay the floor vote, uh, for up to but not more than one week, uh, in order to let the, um, FBI continue ó or, uh, to do an investigation óRUSH: I told you, Snerdley! I told you. I told you.SPEAKER: ó limited in time and scope, uh, to the current allegations that are there. And, uh, limit in time to no more than one week, and IÖ (sigh) I will vote to advance the bill, uh, to the floor w-with that understanding. And I ó Iíve spoken to a few other members, uh, ummm, who, uh ó on my side of the aisle that ó may be supportive as well. But thatís my position. I ó I think that, uh, that we ó we ought to do what we can to make sure that, uh, that we do all due diligence with a nomination this important. And I want to say that this committee has acted properly and, uh, the chairman has bent over backwards, uhhh, to do investigations from this committee and to delay this vote in this committee for a week so that judge ó or so that, uh, Ms. Ford, Dr. Ford could be heard, and she was yesterday. Uh, soÖ So thatís, with that agreement, uhh, I will vote to advance bill for the floor. UhÖGRASSLEY: Clerk will call roll!(crosstalk)RUSH: Okay. Pot it. Pot it down. What Flake is saying here is heís prepared to vote for Kavanaugh in this vote, but he wants a delay for a week on the full Senate vote so that the FBI can investigate. I still donít believe that thatís how they got to him. I think they got to him with Trump, but they could have gotten to him with this FBI business. We got a little few seconds here. Heís still speaking. Letís see. Maybe we can get Grassley and some of the action.FLAKE: My ó my understanding ó and if the Democrats could speak to it, if Chris or ó or you óGRASSLEY: No.FLAKE: ó as we talked about before if the Democrats would accept and endorse a ó a one week, uh, um (sputtering), FBI investigation limited in time and scope.FEINSTEIN: That is correct.GRASSLEY: Well, since youíre the deciding óFLAKE: Yes.GRASSLEY: Well, since youíre the deciding vote here, weíll vote and then if thereís any sort of discussion, weíll go do that after the vote. Call the roll!CLERK: (gavels) Mr. Hatch?HATCH: Aye.CLERK: Mr. Graham?GRAHAM: Aye.CLERK: Mr. Cornyn?CORNYN: Aye.CLERK: Mr. Lee?LEE: Aye.CLERK: Mr. Cruz?CRUZ: Aye.RUSH: Theyíre calling the vote!CLERK: Mr. Sasse?SASSE: Aye.RUSH: Theyíre calling the vote without a commitment to do the FBI investigation!CLERK: Mr. Crapo?CRAPO: Aye.RUSH: Grassley!CLERK: Mr. Tillis?TILLIS: Aye.RUSH: Grassley manned up here!CLERK: Mr. Kennedy?KENNEDY: Aye.CLERK: Mrs. Feinstein?FEINSTEIN: This is on the nominee?GRASSLEY: Yeah.FEINSTEIN: On the nominee, no.CLERK: Mr. Leahy?LEAHY: On the nominee, no.CLERK: Mr. Durbin?DURBIN: No.CLERK: Mr. Whitehouse?WHITEHOUSE: No.RUSH: Our seconds with dwindling.CLERK: Mrs. Klobuchar?KLOBUCHAR: No.RUSH: Weíre hoping to get all this in before we have to do.CLERK: Mr. Coons?COONS: On the nominee, no.CLERK: Mr. Blumenthal?BLUMENTHAL: No.CLERK: Ms. Hirono?HIRONO: No.CLERK: Mr. Booker?BOOKER: No.CLERK: Ms. Harris?HARRIS: No.CLERK: Mr. Chairman?GRASSLEY: Aye.CLERK: Mr. Chairman, the votes are 11 yay, 10 nay.GRASSLEY: The nominee will be reported to the floor.FLAKE: Mr. Chairman, may I óRUSH: Okay, gotta go. Take it away.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. The Senate Judiciary Committee has voted to send the Kavanaugh nomination to the floor, 11-10. Flakeís vote is contingent in the full vote on whether or not they delay that full vote for an FBI investigation, and that now is not up to this committee. Thatís up to the Turtle. Itís up to McConnell as to when the vote takes place. All the rest in there right now is just noise.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. The ball is in Donald Trumpís court now. Weíll see how he deals with this. Just hang on, folks. Iím gonna tell you what happened and put it all in perspective for you.JOHNNY DONOVAN: And now, from sunny south Florida, itís Open Line Friday!RUSH: Itís easy for me to say now, but Snerdley can back me up. I had fears this was gonna happen from the moment I showed up here because weíre talking about Jeff Flake. I didnít say so because I didnít want it reported in the media: ìRush Limbaugh worried about Flake.î I didnít even want to put the idea out there. Iím also not saying some things about the hearings yesterday because I donít want what I say to end up being a distraction. The liberal media is out there waiting for any of that.So Iím kind of holding back here ó and donít worry. Youíre gonna hear what I think at some point. But I gotta be strategic here given all this going on. Hereís where we are. The vote was supposed to be at 9:30 today. The Democrats on the committee asked for a chance to speak before they voted. They began to filibuster. The vote was then announced. When Grassley decided to let that happen, he had to let it happen for everybody. So the Democrats, especially Cory Booker, just started flapping their gums, just started talking about meaningless garbage to make it sound like it was meaningful, but it wasnít. It just time filling and time wasting.The vote was moved back to 1:30. As we approached 1:30, people noticed that Chris Coons and Jeff Flake had left the committee room some moments earlier and nobody had seen íem since. This, of course, made people curious, and they found out that eventually Coons and Flake had been huddling and the Democrats have been working on Flake to agree with them that the FBI needs to take one more look at this, given Blasey Fordís testimony now and given the other allegations, the porn star lawyerís allegation from whatís-her-face. (interruption)No, no, no, no. Avenattiís client. Iím having a mental block on her name. RamirezÖ (interruption) Yeah, Wetnick, Swetnick whatever it is. So the Democrats been pushing for a FBI investigation just to delay things. The FBIÖ Hereís whatís silly about this, folks. The only thing the FBI would do if theyíre authorized to do it is what theyíve already done! The FBI has already said thereís nothing here! This is soÖ I overuse the word ìmaddening.îWell, anyway, Iím jumping the shark here. Let me come back and get back into the chronology. So Flake comes back in with Coons, huddles with Grassley. And the upshot of it is that Flake says he will vote for Kavanaugh if there will be a delay in the full Senate, the floor vote on Kavanaugh for a week so that the FBI could investigate, which is what the Democrats have been demanding and begging for. So they got to Flake somehow.Weíll find out in due course what they promised him or how they got to him. That will eventually reveal itself. So Flake makes his demand of a one-week delay for the FBI, just to we can all be thorough here and remove any clouds of doubt, in exchange for there being a one-week investigation. Well, Grassley ó just to cut to the chase here ó immediately calls the vote without telling Flake whether he accepts Flakeís demand. They do the vote, and Flake votes Kavanaugh.So the vote goes out of the committee 11-10 in favor of Kavanaugh, which doesnít mean anything in terms of the final vote. Donít doubt me. It doesnít mean anything. It used to maybe carry some weight, but it doesnít anymore. What Flake then said is, ìYeah, I voted yes today, but my yes vote on final confirmation of Kavanaugh will not be forthcoming unless there is a one-week FBI investigation.î Heís holding his vote and heís telling everybody he might not vote Kavanaugh if there is no FBI investigation.Well, the problem with all of this is that nobody in that room, in the Senate Judiciary Committee room, can authorize an FBI investigation! Nobody can make that deal with Flake! Grassley canít make that deal because Grassley doesnít run the Senate. Mitch McConnell does. As the majority leader, Mitch McConnell runs the Senate. Mitch McConnell is on record saying there will be a vote next Tuesday on Kavanaugh.Now, that was before Flake pulled this stunt today agreeing with the Democrats that his vote is contingent on a one-week ó maximum one-week ó FBI investigation into only allegations we have at the moment, which would mean Blasey Ford, Ramirez, and Swetnick. But nobody in that room can make this deal. Chuck Schumer, as the minority leader, has to negotiate with McConnell on whether or not thereís gonna be an FBI investigation before the floor vote. Now, McConnellÖ Letís go through the possibilities.McConnell could say, ìI donít care about Jeff Flakeís vote. Weíre not doing an FBI investigation.îThen Schumer could say, ìWell, then my guys are not gonna show up and vote. Weíre gonna walk out! Weíre not gonna vote and neither is Flake.îTo question McConnell is say, ìYou donít want to vote? We donít need your vote, but weíre gonna have the vote.î They canít filibuster it. They canít nuclear option it. Theyíve blown that. The Democrats canít. But getting into what FBI would do, hereís the thing. Do you realize, folks, none of these people have to talk to the FBI in this circumstance?A one-week delay is nothing but silly. It is the Democratsí latest victory in delaying the final vote. Theyíre gonna keep trying to delay and delay until after the midterm elections. That is all this is about because they think theyíre gonna win them, at which point Trumpís nominees go sideways and there will never be a vote on Kavanaugh and Trump will have to pull it ícause it just wonít be the case.Theyíre gonna run the show, House and Senate. Trumpís nominees go nowhere. The only thing the FBI would do is go out and interview a few witnesses. They might interview Mark Judge, for example. But those people do not have to talk to the FBI. They may not want to, and they do not have to. Do not doubt me. None of the people that the Democrats want the FBI to talk to are under any kind of compulsion to talk to the FBI. They do not have to.Meanwhile, the most the FBI would do is interview these people and then turn the interview notes over. Theyíre called 302s. Thereís a Form 302 for an FBI interview. The 302s would be turned over to the Senate and the Senate would be right back where it is today making the decision! The FBI being involved is a nothing burger! It is unnecessary! Itís not going to be determinative at all! And Iíll tell you somethiní else!Iím just gonna go on record here as telling you something else! If ó if ó the FBI investigating this finds out that Dr. Ford is lying, the Democrats will still not change their vote. If the FBI were to find that Avenattiís client is full of it, if the FBI were to find that this Ramirez woman ó whoís the second woman to come forth after Dr. Blasey Ford. If the FBI finds that not only are these witnesses lying, but there is nothing to what theyíre saying, and if thatís what they reportÖ Well, they wouldnít report it. The Senate would.They would get the interviews, and if any interviews the FBI finds out that Blasey Ford is lyingÖ This is just a possibility here. You know, hypothetical. My point is, this is so irrelevant and so un-determinative and so not really necessary that no matter what the FBI finds, the Democrats are not gonna change their vote. Right now, the Democrats are operating on the premise that Blasey Ford cannot lie.ìSheís a woman! Sheís making the allegation; itís true. We must take her seriously,î and ìtake her seriouslyî means believing her! If we donít believe her, weíre insulting her. If we donít believe her, weíre not taking her seriously.î So the FBI goes and talks to her. She canít tell them where it happened. If she now tells them where it happened then theyíve got a problem because she under oath said she doesnít know where it happened. If she suddenly remembers, we got a problem. If she suddenly remembers when it happened, specific date and time, we have a problem because sheís under oath saying she doesnít remember that.So they go interview her. She says the same thing to the FBI she said yesterday. Nobody knows anymore than they know today. The FBI will furnish their 302s and reports and will add no new information to anything because all of this already has been investigated by committee investigators. If there are no changes, if there is no corroborating evidence, if the four people named by Blasey Ford who claim today under oath that they do not know what sheís talking about, that they werenít there ó if they say that to the FBI ó will the Democrats accept it because itís coming from the FBI?No.Iím here to tell you that thereís no circumstance under which the Democrats are gonna change their vote on this guy. Some of the red state Democrats might like Joe Manchin and some of the others that are maybe feeling some heat in the midterms. But the Democrats at large, as a party, are not going to change their votes on this. And the reason Iím saying that is to point out the futility and the utter irrelevance of this and cement the point that it is nothing more than another delay. TrumpÖ You know, Jeff Flake does not get to authorize the FBI.The only thing at stake here is Jeff Flakeís vote. Flake voted for Kavanaugh in the committee on the basis that thereís gonna be an FBI investigation of a week. If that investigation doesnít happen, then Flake can say, ìOkay. Iím not voting for the guy.î But Flake cannot authorize the FBI and Grassley canít authorize the FBI and Dianne Feinstein canít authorize the FBI. And the FBIís already said they donít want any part of it! The FBIís already said to them itís a closed case. Itís not in their jurisdiction!There hasnít been a formal complaint filed where it happened in Montgomery County!Itís 36 years old!The American people ought to be outraged at the Democrat Party. The American people ought to be fit to be tied and frustrated as hell over the Democrat Party thwarting the process here, because that is all this is. Well, itís not all it is. In addition to all of that, it is the purposeful ó and I mean that. It is the purposeful destruction of a man and his career ó his achievements, his integrity, his reputation, his family ó and his life in general. That is also on the table as a threat to anybody else who might come along and threaten the Supreme Court as somebody like Judge Kavanaugh does.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: A friend of mine known affectionately as ìMr. Hawaiiî just sent me a text and said, ìWhat is the purpose of the delay?î Well, let me tell you what the purpose of the delay is. I just watched Chris Coons, who made the deal with Flake, say (paraphrased), ìLook, we need to remove the cloud over the head of Judge Kavanaugh, and I think everyone agrees that the FBI looking into this ó or any new allegations ó in the next week. It is something that should be a bipartisan effort because this committee was too partisan. The American people need to see us working together.îSo we have a one-week delay that the Democrats now say, ìMaximum, weíll agree, one-week delay. Have the FBI come in, look at this.î But Coons also said, ìAny new allegations that come in, they, of course, should be investigated.î The reason for the delay is for new allegations to be brought forth ó and Iím telling you, the Democrats already have them in their back pockets like cards waiting to be played. The reason for the delay is to get another delay. And after securing that next delay, go for another one.All of this is about one of two things: Delaying the vote or having it canceled before the elections in November, or having the president withdraw Kavanaugh or Kavanaugh withdraw himself. Those are the objectives. Anything to prevent the vote. Anything! Thatís what the delay is. The delay is the next phase in new allegations. ìBut, Rush, they just agreed to one week.î Folks, wait. Itís Monday, next week, hypothetically ó and everybody thinks the FBI is looking into Blasey Ford and some of these others.And then why, lo and behold, here comes another Democrat lawyer with another allegation! Do you think the Democrats gonna say, ìWell, we canít investigate that because we agreed to end all this on Fridayî? Ha! If thereís a new allegation, it will be met with a demand to extend the investigation. We said it from the beginning of this process: Every day the Republicans do not call the vote on this is a day there isnít going to be one.And itís now getting to the point every day that the vote is not called equals four or five days of delay. So now the ball is in the court of the Turtle, Mitch McConnell. By the way, TrumpÖ Apparently, they got a press gaggle in there at the White House. Did you hear what Trump said? ìWell, if thatís what they want, let it play out.î ThatísÖ I didnít see it. That is a report that I got. I guess I should say this with an asterisk. I have learned unless I see it myself, that I should pass it along to you with reservation.A lot of people think they hear something, but when I look at it, I donít hear what they heard. But the note I got was that Trump said, ìWell, if they want to let it play out, let it play out.î I have another fear here. (chuckling) Iím wondering if I ought to keep quiet about it or not. I almost walked in during the break to tell people and make my prediction whatís coming next. (long pause) Iíll think about it. In the meantime, letís go to the phones. We got Michelle in Topeka, Kansas, who has been waiting awhile.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: MSNBC is reporting that Senator Murkowski is supporting Senator Flakeís call for a delay.Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. But, again, they donít have anything to say about it. Itís gonna be McConnell. But whatís McConnell gonna do if more and more members of his caucus ask for a delay? Again, letís look at this way. Letís say that next Monday, Christopher Wray, director of the FBI calls a press conference and says, ìThe FBI has completed its investigation.îHeís got Robert Mueller standing right next to him.ìWe have completed our investigation. We have found absolutely no evidence of collusion in the 2016 election between Donald Trump and the Russians or vice versa.îDo you think the Democrats would say, ìWhoa. Okay. Coolî?Do you think they would accept it? No. Just as theyíre not gonna accept if the FBI turns in interview reports that doesnít change the circumstances today, that donít change the status quo. If the FBI happens to turn in a report that theyíve confirmed that Dr. Blasey Ford is lying, it isnít gonna change the Democratsí vote on this. Thatís why all of this is pointless and a waste of time.(interruption)RUSH: Snerdley, youíre acting surprised.(interruption)RUSH: Youíre not surprised Murkowski threw in with Flake, are you?(interruption)RUSH: Right. Yeah.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We have audio of President Trump this afternoon in the White House shortly after the shenanigans in the Judiciary Committee where the vote was called and it was 11-10 to support Kavanaugh out of the committee. Jeff Flake agreeing with the Democrats for a one-week delay for the FBI to investigate whatever the Democrats can find next in addition to Blasey Ford and whatever else.So the one week investigation is gonna be expanded because, by Monday at the latest, thereís gonna be another allegation, and the Democrats are gonna say, ìWell, we canít control that!î Ha-ha-ha. So anyway, when they got to Trump, he was meeting with the president of Chile, Sebastian Pinera, and White House correspondent Jim Acosta was Acosta-ing Trump. He said, ìWhat did you think of Dr. Fordís testimony when you heard it?îTHE PRESIDENT: I thought her testimony was very compelling, and she looks like a very fine woman to me. Very fine woman. And I thought that Brettís testimony, likewise, was really something that I havenít seen before. It was incredible. It was an incredible moment, I think, in the history of our country.RUSH: And then the question was, ìWould you be willing to reopen the background investigation into Kavanaugh?î Listen carefullyÖTHE PRESIDENT: Iím just hearing a little bit about it because Iíve been with the president of Chile, and weíre talking about some very important subjects. But, uhhh, Iím sure it will all be very good. I guess the vote was a positive vote, but there seems to be a delay. Iíll learn more about it as the day goes on. Iím gonna rely on all of the people, including Senator Grassley, whoís doing a very good job. Uh, that will be a decision that theyíre going to make, and I suspect theyíll be making some decision soon, whether to take a vote or to do whatever else they want to do. I will be totally reliant on what Senator Grassley and the group decides to do.RUSH: Well, it isnít gonna be Grassley. Itís gonna be McConnell. So the president is basically deferring, at least in this statement, to the Senate. If McConnell, Grassley, whoever, want the FBI to look into it, then the president seemingly is fine. He will leave the FBI decision up to them. I still donít know about this authorizing the FBI business. I thought Trump had to do it. So, Snerdley, think I ought to share my prediction or withhold?(interruption)RUSH: All right. Iíll withhold it.(interruption)RUSH: They know I made it. If my predictionís right, it wonít be long weíll find out ó and if it happens, youíll know it, folks. (chuckling) Believe me, youíll know it.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Iíve got a question. As long as weíre getting the FBI back in here, how about reopening the Hillary email investigation? I mean, they exonerated her before they even interviewed her. How about reopening that? Hmm? Hey, Senator Flake, could you make this part of your deal? Could you, say, get the FBI to relook at Blasey Ford be contingent on the FBI reopening the Hillary email investigation? Senator Flake? Could you do that?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. My predictionÖ Iím not gonna voice it, but if it happens, I guarantee you will know what it is. But I donít want to be a factor in it, so thatís why Iím not announcing it. Iím not holding back on you, folks. Iím trying to be responsible here, unlike half of the damn United States Senate.  "

WhyÖ? Why donít we take Dr. Ford seriously? WhyÖ? Why do we disrespect Dr. Ford? Why do weÖ?î What does that mean? On the left, what does ìtake her seriouslyî mean? Who did not take her seriously? Everybody bent over backwards! In fact, everybody treated her like she was so fragile that she might crack and break at the slightest little raised voice.Everybody was treating her with kid gloves!What do you mean, ìtake here seriouslyî?Well, I know what they mean. Iím asking the question rhetorically. What they mean is, ìWhy donít you believe her?î Well, the answer is because she doesnít have any evidence and thereís no corroboration for it. Thatís why! ìWell, thatís not fair. Sheís come forward at great risk, and using great courage. Why wonít you take her seriously?î Everybody did take her seriously. She was given every opportunity in the book! And then this congresswoman said, ìWhy wonít Grassley and the Republicans open an FBI investigation?ìWhy are they so reluctant? Itís because theyíre afraid the FBIís gonna find something that disproves what they believe! If youíre Kavanaugh, and if youíre really innocent, why not do it? Why not have it really proclaimed youíre innocent?î Because you donít need to. But thatís not the reason, and they donít want to say it! Iíll say it: The reason theyíre not calling the FBI in is because you people are doing nothing but trying to delay this, and theyíre not gonna fall for your trick! Now, for some reason, GrassleyÖOther than Graham. Grahamís the only one that pointed at íem and told them what theyíre gonna do. He called íem out on it. Didnít faze íem. Didnít faze íem a bit. He nailed íem to the wall. He told them exactly what theyíre doing and why it isnít gonna work and how unfair it is. This ongoing whining and moaning about the FBI is nothing more than an attempt to delay and, after that, itís designed to put a cloud of doubt over Kavanaugh. (impression) ìKavanaugh didnít want the FBI! The Republicans didnít want the FBI examining what went on here.ìIf youíre really innocent, why wouldnít you want an investigation?î Thereís been an investigation! Six FBI background checks of the guy! If we know already that heís really innocent and Dr. Ford canít prove what sheís saying, then what is the point? Iím telling you this frustrates people. Iím getting more email about this. The Democrats do not know what theyíre doing with this FBI garbage. They are irritating people far more than they are buttressing their forces on the left. Letís go back to the phones as promised. Worcester, Massachusetts. Steve, youíre next. Hello, sir.CALLER: Hello. Wicked mega dittos, Rush. Iím calling from behind enemy lies here.RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: This is one of the highlights of my life talking to you.RUSH: Thank you, sir.CALLER: Iím part of the silent majority, never having my voice heard anywhere up here, and Iím grateful for this opportunity to converse with you. But what Iím calling about is why Iím not hearing the Republicans make an issue of how Dr. Ford deleted all her social media before her testifying, bringing it to public knowledge. I would consider that destruction of evidence.RUSH: Because they were treating her seriously. They were taking Dr. FordÖ Itís a good question. Nobody did bring it up. She did. She hadÖ I donít even know if she did it or somebody did it. Some of the activists working for her did it. Democrats probably. They scrubbed her social media the minute she was identified. I mean, within, what, a half day of her being identified, they scrubbed her social media. They got it. They deleted it. They erased it.And they didnít bring it up yesterday because they knew she had no evidence! She didnít bring anything new! She brought no corroboration! Nothing. All she brought was her heroism and her caring and her, uh Ö her, uhÖ her truth. Yeah, that was a favorite word Democrats are using. Yeah. ìShe came with her truth.î She came with her version. We didnít get to the truth yesterday. What we got to was she couldnít prove what she was alleging. And the people she named?I mean, I donítÖ I donítÖ Heh. (chuckles) The people she named claimed they werenít there. The Democrats say, ëBut they didnít say that to the FBI. They said it in a sworn affidavit and sworn affidavits are not enough. Sworn affidavits are never enough!î Oh, really? Well, they clearly were plenty to try to nail Trump! Sworn affidavits left and right to try to go get FISA warrants to spy on Trump! Sworn affidavits here are people claiming under penalty of felony, meaning they know that they are committing a felony by lying; if they get caught, itís jail time. They sign the affidavits anyway. She had no evidence. So the RepublicansÖ Really, she was treated like a fragile teenager. One gust of wind could have ruined her day! Thatís why.Michael in Sterling, Virginia. You are next on the EIB Network. Hello.CALLER: Hey, Rush. How are you? Recent Harvard grad. Always nice to break out echo chamber with you.RUSH: Well! A recent Harvard grad.CALLER: Yeah, and I have some friends back there. People are apparently losing their minds right now in some of the predictable ways. But the question I wanted to ask you, Rush, is: Look, obviously this whole hearing is playing into the popular narrative of Republicans equal anti-woman party. I canít help but wonder if and when there will be a tipping point with these miscarriages of justice, ultimately the narrative shifts to Democrats becoming the anti-man party. Do you think that will happen, and if so, are we there now, or when does it happen?RUSH: Weíre not there now, but itís a good question. I donít know how likely it is, but Iíve already seen in a number of places that I scour on a daily basis in show prep ó and Iíve had emails from people I know ó and the reaction Iím getting from a lot of mothers who have sons is that theyíre scared to death. Theyíre scared to death what they see being done to men here ó and Kavanaugh is a choirboy! Kavanaugh is a choirboy.Theyíre trying to turn a choirboy into a serial rapist who deserves to be behind bars, and then whatever happens to him there, he deserves. Now, if youíre an average, ordinary American mom and you have a couple of sons or a son, and youíre about ready to send him off to where liberals run things like at universities and collegesÖ And you can already seeing whatís happening with the snowflake movement, the social justice warriors with white privilege, white-privilege males being the reason for all the problems in America.Iím seeing ó and itís all anecdotal. By that I mean I havenít seen anything scientific in terms of polling data. Iím just aware that ó and itís not reported in the media. This would be one of these things like in the 2002 midterms that the Republicans ended up winning. In the aftermath, they ask people, ìWhat was the reason for your vote?î and they said ìvalues,î and nobody thought values were a part of the 2002 midterm campaign.ìItís midterm House races. What do you mean ëvaluesí?î It turned out it was the Wellstone memorial. They watched that, and they were appalled by the values they saw there. Values voters came out and won a Republican majority in an off-year election after Bushís first term. Itís unheard of and nobody saw it coming. We could be at the beginning of something similar to that at the way boys are being treated. Theyíve got moms too.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I just ran into this story. This is from our buddies at NewsBusters. ìFeminist Author Jill Filipovic Demands Women ëDivorce Your Republican Husbandsí ó [F]eminist author Jill Filipovic Ö tweeted instructions to her fellow scorned women on how to get back at the man. ëDivorce your Republican husbands.'î This is why I say, ladies and gentlemen, that I think a lot of political activists are actually victims of psychological issues and are projecting it onto the world of politics.I thinkÖ I really do. I think this is the way to explain much of liberalism, that they have victimized so many people, made them think theyíre victims. That means theyíre helpless, things are hopeless. Everythingís stacked against íem. Whateverís wrong in their lives, itís somebody elseís fault. The Democrat Party has lassoed all these people and has promised to fix things for them by getting even with the people who are responsible for mistreating
íem, which happens to be white, male Republicans.This is so deranged. ìDivorce your RepublicanÖî? Sheís serious! ìDivorce your Republican husbands.î Thatís how we get back at what the Republicans are doing to Dr. Ford. ìYou get even with íem! You divorce your Republican husband.î Sheís serious about it. Sheís tweeting it out there. People are treating it seriously. This is deranged. This is a psychological disorder of some merit, some degree. You read something like this and you canít help laugh at it, and then you realize theyíre serious.Get even with the Republicans for what theyíve done to Dr. Ford by divorcing your Republican husband and take him for all heís worth. Now, somebody tell me that thatís rational. Tell me itís a rational way to think, that itís a rational solution to a problem. None of it is rational! But it makes perfect sense if you look at these people rather than being political activists, that they are first people with psychological disorders who have found their way into the political system and been validated.Their psychological disorder, their mess, whatever it is, has been validated by the Democrat Party, which then goes and makes policy based on all of this, and then it finds its way into the curriculum at universities in the form of womenís studies curricula and other such things.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Letís go back to the phones. Stephanie in Savannah, Georgia. Youíre next. Itís great to have you here.CALLER: Hi. Good to talk to you. I was calling just as a mom of three young boys 4 years and under. This case has really gotten my attention. You know, right now Iím just trying to keep them from burping at the table and to use their inside voices. But I know as they get older, my husband and I are gonna be teaching them to be gentlemen and to be honest and have good character and ó in our house ó to be godly men.So I was watching yesterday, and I missed some. Not a lot but I have three little ones so I missed a little bit. Just watching was so discouraging because it breaks my heart that for my boys, even if they do live an upstanding life, that because theyíre males, they can be brought down and their lives be ruined if just one female brings an accusation against them.Just because theyíre female, they deserve to be believed, apparently. So I just felt bad for Judge Kavanaughís parents and for his mom sitting there having to listen to her son defend himself ó and his kids ó and prove to the whole nation that heís not a sexual predator. So it just breaks my heart for her. It breaks my heart that nobody has the backs of our boys anymore.RUSH: No, they donít. No, they donít. Not right now. Itís become fashionable even for Republicans to accept the idea that there is wanton male abuse out there because everybody wants the womenís vote, just like it was fashionable to agree with the concept of amnesty because everybody wants the Latino or Hispanic vote. Look, youíre one of many mothers from whom Iíve heard with the same concerns.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: We got Michelle in Topeka, Kansas, who has been waiting awhile. Hi, Michelle. Great to have you here.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Itís an honor to talk to you. Long-term listener. I am a Midwest mom who is mad as heck ó to be nice ó at Washington. We watched the hearing, the whatever, the show yesterday.RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: And even my son, whoís 13 years old, comes home from school, watches a couple hours of it, and he goes, ìDo they not even understand the law, everybody calling for these FBI investigations?îRUSH: Your 13-year-old son said that?CALLER: Yes! He goes, ìTheyíre idiots,î and Iím like, ìYes, they are,î and I have a son, a stepson. I have six brothers, a husband whoís self-employed, and Iím going, ìIf they can do this to this judge, what about them?îRUSH: I was gonna say, ìHow many of them are rapists?îCALLER: None that I know of.RUSH: See, ìthat (you) know ofî is the key.CALLER: (giggles) Judge Kavanaugh, I cried yesterday for him and his family. (choking up) To put somebody that has that kind of standard through that while all the people attacking himÖ? (groans)RUSH: Michelle?CALLER: Ugh!RUSH: It is that standard that is under frontal and direct assault in this country.CALLER: Well óRUSH: People who live and have the value base of Judge Kavanaugh and his family are exactly what the left is assaulting in this country.CALLER: Exactly.RUSH: Kavanaugh happens to be the front-and-center victim right now, but that is exactly the kind of people and life they are trying to erase from government.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The problem here isÖ Well, not the problem. TheÖ Well, it is. Brett Kavanaugh, in a certain period in Americaís past, would have been considered the epitome of an ideal American man. Well educated, hardworking, a good husband, devoted to family and community, charitable, concerned with others, a great father, great colleague, good boss. Chamber of Commerce kind of guy! I mean, the kind of man that any community would hoist upon a pedestal with pride, whoíd be a role model for his own kids and others in town.A Norman Rockwell type of American. Hardworking. Nothing handed. No shortcuts. Everything about Kavanaugh ó pretty much every characteristic he has ó is a threat to the modern-day left. Kavanaugh is the epitome of the example of how you do not need a big government, how you do not need constant help. Heís a glittering and shining example of the lack of dependence. Heís a man. He does things on his own based on his acceptance of responsibility, combined with maturity.These are things that today people like Kavanaugh are blamed because of, using my theory that left-wing political activists are actually people with psychological disorders who have infected the political system with their disorders, manifested in demands that whoever is responsible for the mistreatment of these people, the government get even with íem. Well, Kavanaugh is a classic example of a guy whoís responsible for the shortcomings of others simply by virtue of his achievements!The fact that heís white and Catholic just adds to the fact that they hate him. Now you add that heís conservative and a judge nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court ó which, to the people on the left, the Supreme Court is the embodiment, itís the last reservoir of maintaining their psychological disorders as national policy. So thereís not a redeeming thing about a man like Brett Kavanaugh to people on the left, and Iím not exaggerating. Some of you might find this a biiiiiit over the top.I honestly donít think it is.They much prefer sniveling, weak, dependent people.Those people are bendable, flake-able, malleable. Those people can easily be turned into reliable supporters and voters. People like that are unwilling to turn their lives ó people like Kavanaugh unwilling to turn their lives ó over to government, government agencies, some government official. Itís considered irresponsible to have somebody else tell you how to live your life, good or bad. Itís just not part of the thought process of being an American.You donít turn to others. Others are not responsible for what happens to you ó and your failures, you donít blame on other people. And then after you fail you donít get mad at whoever you think wronged you and join the political process and get even with whoever wronged you. Kavanaugh represents the antithesis to all that. Heís not alone. Thereís a lot of Kavanaughs in America. Most of them you donít know about.You know them in your community. They donít have national acclaim, but there are a lot of them out there, and they represent the target. Theyíre the ones that have the bullís-eye on them. He just happens to be very prominent and would haveÖ Well, heíd be one of the top 20 most powerful people in American government as a Supreme Court justice. As such, it cannot be permitted for Kavanaugh to be permitted on the court with this makeup.If the Democrats held the court right now 7-2 or 6-3 in favor of liberals and one of the three conservatives was resigning and Kavanaugh was nominated to replace him? No sweat. Theyíd confirm him yesterday, maybe. I mean, maybe a big fight, but they wouldnít go to this length to keep him off of it. The fact that heís gonna become a genuine No. 5, consistent No. 5 on the conservative side? Unacceptable.Right smack-dab in the middle of all of that is their fear of how he would vote if Roe v. Wade came up again. They are convinced he would vote to overturn it, despite what he has said, despite the fact that thatís not gonna be what happens anyway with Roe v. Wade. And not just Roe v. Wade, but Obamacare and its repeal. He has openly stated that he thinks Obamacare is unconstitutional.So that would go by the wayside, too. So heís painted a couple of targets on his back rulings-wise, in addition to the target thatís there just because of the kind of man that he is. And not only do they not have any compunction about destroying his life, career, family, they do it eagerly. They do it as they celebrate it. They celebrate the destruction.  "

She was so nice, and she was so thoughtful, and she was heroic,î and all of these other descriptives but none of them mattered.It doesnít have anything to do with what was at stake yesterday, except if youíre liberal Democrats, where, to them, the nature of the evidence is not of any relevance at all. Itís the seriousness of the charge, which means that it is true. In the same thing, I start getting irritated. Itís why I donít watch a lot of cable news anymore. I tuned in yesterday when I got home. I wanted to watch the completion of Kavanaugh. I watched his opening statement here and then left and got home in time to see some of the Q&A.And then I turned over to the media, and the media starts analyzing what just happened, and here the guys are on CNN and MSNBC. And theyíre acting like (impression), ìEverybody thinks that Kavanaughís a liar. Every American! Every American thought that Dr. Ford was brilliant and a hero and so honest and so real ó and ó and ó and so caring and so thoughtful and soÖî It just drives me nuts that these people start assuming that every American agrees with them.For example, the Democrats say, ìMan, this poor woman has been so mistreated. This is really going to inspire our voters!î I thought Democrats didnít need to be inspired! I thought they were already fired up? Thereís more evidence. Weíve got a Pew Research Center poll. Republicans are just as fired up as Democrats are. Fairly close, but Republicans on balance are just as fired up. Thereís no particular fired-up advantage that the Democrats have. In the real world, thereís continued evidence. Michael Mooreís movie. Wouldnít you thinkÖ?In an America that just canít wait to destroy Trump ó just canít wait to fix its mistake of voting for Trump ó realizes that they made the gravest error theyíve ever made and they hate Trump now and theyíre embarrassed of what they did and they canít wait to get out there and vote Trump and the Republicans out of office in November ó wouldnít you think a deranged lunatic hate-Trump movie would draw record crowds and raise record revenue? You would think that. But Michael Mooreís movie is bombing everywhere. Itís bombing in the case of ticket sales. Itís bombing revenue-wise.At the Toronto Film Festival, it barely was voted the eighth best. That doesnít sound like blue wave stuff to me. Doesnít sound likeÖ I mean, these people, as rabid as they are in their hatred and resentment for Trump, would go anywhere they could to get their taste and fill of it. Iíll tell you what did Michael Moore in, in addition to the fact that I think itís way, way overblown. I donít deny there are plenty of people that hate Trump. Donít misunderstand. Weíve got more Americans than I ever thought possible with psychological disorders who are considered political activists on the left.And theyíre out there, and theyíre numerous. Theyíre not the majority of people in this country. I simply refuse to believe that a majority of our population has and is governed by psychological disorders, that psychological disorders determine their politics. I refuse to believe that. Not a majority. But hereís the problem with Moore. He goes out there, produces this anti-Trump movie, and he forgets that audiences donít have to pay any money to see it. All they have to do is turn on CNN! All they have to do is turn on PMSNBC.All they have to do is read the Washington Post, the New York Times. Why go to a movie, and why pay whatever it costs to go see a movie where you can see the same thing every night, every day over and over again for absolutely zilch? So Mooreís sense of timing, his sense of where the public is, the belief that the country hates Trump? Everywhere you see this, everywhere you see leftists trying to make money or raise money on the basis of Trump hatred, it just bombs. They lost the special election in Texas where the Democrats had carried the district for something like 139 years.In Texas, in the middle of whatís supposed to be a blue wave!  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/28/look-in-the-mirror-dick-blumenthal/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 28, 2018RUSH: We are supposedly less than a half hour away from the Senate Judiciary Committee voting Brett Kavanaugh out to a recommendation of the full Senate to be confirmed to the United States Supreme Court. Itís gonna be an 11-10 vote with the announcement today by Jeff Flake and Bob Corker that they are going to vote ìyesî on Kavanaugh.Democrats on the committee are speechifying and walking out of the committee. The last senator to speak was Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. Honestly, I understand Connecticutís a big blue state, and I understand itís just overflowing with New York Times-groveling-and-reading voters. Democrats. But this guy BlumenthalÖ I donít know how many people know this, and if you did know it, how many of you remembered it. You remember yesterdayÖ? Well, you probably donít. Blumenthal, when it was his turn to interrogate (if you will) Justice Kavanaugh, came up with a Latin phrase and asked Kavanaugh if he knew what it was.
ìFalsus in uno, falsus in omnibus.î You know, legal people like to use Latin and throw it around so that we donít know what theyíre talking about. It sounds sophisticated and educated to start tossing around Latin. ìFalsus in uno, falsus in omnibus.î What it means isÖ Itís a principle in trial that if a witness is shown to have lied about one thing, then you can go ahead and proceed on the basis that a witness has lied about everything, and this is why itís always dicey for lawyers to put known liars on the witness stand.This is one of the problems with having defendants testify. If thereís a record of them lying, itís a legitimate question: ìWell, how do we know youíre telling the truth now? ìëCause I am! I am! I am! Iím not lying now.î But you have, and so itís just an automatic strike against oneís credibility. The legal principle of ìfalsus in uno, falsus in omnibusî means that if you lie about one thing, then itís perfectly acceptable ó and even, in some cases, required ó to believe that you would lie about everything.I thought, ìWhat a guy to bring that up! Richard Blumenthal!î Richard Blumenthal, senator from Connecticut, lied for years about serving in Vietnam. Not just serving in Vietnam, serving with great valor. He lied for years thinking it would help his resume and that it would counter some of the beliefs that people have about left-wingers being pansies and this kind of thing. So he routinely lies, and the press doesnít challenge him on it because they donít want to challenge him on it because they donít want to believe that he might be lying about it.If anybody came forward and said that he is lying about it, then they would defend him. Finally, the heat got so bad that he had to admit it. To watch him trying to talk about ìfalsus in uno, falsus in omnibus,î trying to say, ìKavanaugh, you lied about one thing. We can infer youíre lying about everythingî? Same goes for you, Senator! Goose for gander. Kettle calling black. Everything works here. If youíre gonna start holding other people up to that standard, then you better look at it and have it apply to yourself.The specific translation for ìfalsus in uno, falsus in omnibusî means somebody who would lie about his military service will lie about anything. Thatís how we seek to define it here. So there he is questioning Kavanaugh ó Kavanaughís honesty and Kavanaughís credibility and so forth. This is the kind of thing that when people find out about it, it just rubs them raw.  "

You remember the color of the walls, you remember how you got home, you remember the face, you remember the music that was playing, you remember the layout of the house. You donít forget it, particularly as she said she had PTSD? Iíve been diagnosed with PTSD. You relive that every single day. You never forget it! So I donít believe one word of this woman, and I feel sorry that I have to say that, because women should be believed. But this is so blatantly political and partisan, I canít stand it anymore! Thatís my comment.RUSH: Well, Iím glad you called. You wanted to get it off your chest.CALLER: Oh, yes.RUSH: Now, wait a minute. Let me just ask you something.CALLER: Yes?RUSH: Are there not some traumas that are so harrowing that victims do repress the memory and forget?CALLER: Not with PTSD. PTSD, part of the symptoms is you relive it every day, and sometimes multiple times.RUSH: A-ha. A good point! She did say PTSD.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: PTSD, in order to have it, you have to have the memory. Is that what youíre saying?CALLER: Well, you know what? Then she had more than one beer, which makes her a perjurer.RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: Okay? My question is óRUSH: Your question is?CALLER: Go ahead. Iím sorry.RUSH: No! Whatís your question?CALLER: My question is, ìCan Brett Kavanaugh sue for defamation of character?îRUSH: No.CALLER: Why not?RUSH: Well, everythingís possible. In politics, itís really difficult to do this because of the First Amendment. The First Amendment was really written for political speech. No limits on it whatsoever. So you can defame people in political ads, for example. People have tried to run defamation suits. But they usually end because of this thing called ìdiscovery.î (chuckles) You have to open your life up to the competing client and lawyer. Let me tell you something about PTSD. I know a guy who had to go to drug rehab, and he told me a story about it.One of the things that they do in drug rehab is try to take you back to the earliest memories you have in life that could have caused some kind of psychological disorder, which could have led to your being unable to face reality and looking for ways to numb pain and so forth. And he told me they tried to tell him, based on some stories that he described of this childhood, that he had PTSD because of the way his parents treated him, and he had neverÖUntil he had been told in drug therapy, heíd never considered any of the sort of thing. But they zeroed in on his upbringing and stories he told about growing up. They turned around and said, ìYou have been traumatized. Your parents traumatized you.î My point is that therapists out there haveÖ There are certain hot issues that go from time to time. PTSD is one, and Iím not informed enough to know what all the different disorders are.But somebody who never thought they had PTSD ó it would never even occur that they had Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, especially from the way their parents treated íem ó were told that they had it. Now, if you happen to be somewhat insecure and if you happen to be looking for excuses to explain the things about yourself that you donít like, and somebody comes along and tells you, ìYou have PTSD,î it may be easy to believe it. And thereby have a built-in excuse for whatever is wrong with you. I just think itís interesting that somebody that had never even considered it, they tried to convince him he had it and it was why he was behaving the way he was.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/28/rush-24-7-morning-update-89/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 28, 2018RUSH: In their attempts to keep Judge Kavanaugh off the Supreme Court, liberal Democrats have sunk to a new low.In liberal America, particularly among elected Democrats and their Drive-By-Media allies, it is now okay to smear a distinguished nominee to our highest court with uncorroborated, unprovable, and absurd allegations from a porn lawyer.Judge Kavanaugh spent a lifetime serving this country, without a blemish on his record or his good name. But in the space of fourteen days, he and his family have seen that lifetime record of exemplary service spat on, courtesy of the todayís Democrat party.And, even now, they are unapologetic. They have no shame or remorse for what they unleashed on Judge Kavanaugh, Dr. Blasey Ford, the confirmation process, and the country.Judge Kavanaugh fought to reclaim the honor of his good name, which liberals tried to destroy so viciously. He deserves to sit on the court. He always has.What Democrats and their media allies deserve is another matter entirely. And not fit for young or old ears in this form.  "

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/27/callers-have-their-say-on-the-hearing/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 27, 2018RUSH: So letís grab the phones while we have some time here before the hearing resumes and weíll start with Michelle in Pennsylvania. Hi. Your turn. What do you think?CALLER: I donít know where to start, Rush. Let me start by saying I am a recent convert to your show during the Obama years, and I thank you for what you do to enlighten us. I am a 52-year-old woman. In 1989, I was 23 years old, and I was the victim of a serious sexual assault. When I say sexual assault, I mean rape. I have a problem with people saying ìsexual assault.î Anyways, I donít forget one detail of what happened that New Yearís Eve by no fault of my own.I remember the manís name.I remember what he looked like.I remember his eye color.I remember what he wore.I remember being trapped in that specific house and not being able to leave.So this woman, this doctor, this educated woman is just making my blood boil. And I donít want to pass judgment on her situation. I wasnít there; so I canít say. And I know everybody deals with trauma differently. But I find it very hard to believe that this educated, accomplished woman doesnít understand these questions, doesnít know her vocabulary. I just donít get it, and Iím very upset.RUSH: Let me ask you this, because I have a question for you, and this is what itís gonna all come down to for everybody at the end of the day here. Do you believe, according toÖ? After having listened to her, do you believe that happened to her in a room in a house at around 1982 at around sometime after 6 oíclock at night approximately? Do you believe something happened to this woman?CALLER: Again, I donít want to pass judgment on another galís situation. I would have liked to have been able to see what was going on. I was just óRUSH: No, but Iím asking you to.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: This is what these senators are gonna have to decide, ìDid something happen to her?î And then if the answer to that is ìyesî then, okay. Do they believe her that it was Kavanaugh (sheís unequivocal, 100%) or are they gonna believe Kavanaughís denial later? Do you believe that sheís being truthful that something happened? Iím not asking you now if Kavanaugh did it. Do you believe now based on the way sheís told the story ó and you can add your own experience in if you want. But youíre just watching this today. Do you believe something happened to her as she describes it?CALLER: I think she thinks something happened to her and I think something might have happened to her at some point in her life. But whether she is coming forth of her own volition or sheís being wound up by political parties with an agenda? Thatís another affair. But I donít thinkÖ In this country, you cannot just assassinate a personís character without some kind of evidence. I can tell you that friends and families of mine could vouch for something that happened to me back then. There were specific timelines. People knew what happened.RUSH: Because you told them.CALLER: Because I did. Youíre darn right I did. So something doesnít add up. So my question to these senators is, ìWhat is not adding up?îRUSH: Well, it depends on which senators you talk to.CALLER: And I get that.RUSH: But let me just answer your question. We most certainly can in America today. Youíre watching it happen. We most certainly can destroy a life. We can destroy a career. We can destroy exceptional achievement. We can destroy a future and a past, and we can destroy a family.CALLER: You can.RUSH: Weíre watching it happen! We absolutely are. The Democrats are more than willing to do that. Thatís what weíre up against, and thatís one of the reasons our people are hamstrung. They donít know quite how to deal with people who are willing to do that. Here, imagine this setup. Weíre up against people who have no compunction whatsoever about doing just that, and what is our reaction? ìWe canít be seen as bullies!î They can bully Kavanaugh all day, and theyíre going to.They can embark on a political course of action that will result in Brett Kavanaughís life, career, accomplishments and achievements being wiped out and destroyed, his future ó and who knows what itís gonna do to his family. They can do that all day long. Theyíre doing it. Weíre saying to ourselves, ìWe gotta be real careful ícause we canít appear to be unfair or bullying of the woman who is making it possible.î Youíre absolutely right.There is no corroborating evidence for this, and there isnít gonna be when this is over. Sheís offered nothing new. Sheís offered no new evidence, no new proof, no nothing. Nothing new, nothingís changed. Yet tune to the media, and the media is convinced ó even our media, Fox News ó itís over. It may as well be over. The Democrats are hitting grand-slam home runs with every five-minute segment; the Republicans are not even on the field.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Itíll be interesting to see if the Republicans on the committee are as frustrated as some of you are about how the morning has gone. Itíll be interesting to see what strategery has been changed during the recess here, what procedural changes there might be. Now, Dr. Ford said something else that, to me, is contradictory. One of the people supposedly in the room when this assault happened was a friend of hers. The friendís name is Leland Keyser, and Dr. Ford mentioned her again today as being there, but Keyser remembers neither Kavanaugh nor the incident. And sheís a friend.Iíve got time to squeeze in another call here. Pat in Chicago. Youíre next. Hello.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Itís truly a great honor to speak with you.RUSH: Thank you very much. I appreciate that.CALLER: I heard everything that I needed to hear after her opening statement. I was writing down some notes as she was reading her opening statement.RUSH: Yeah?CALLER: She indicated that both Kavanaugh and Judge were, quote, ìinebriated and belligerentî and that they had been drinking prior to coming to this residence. She indicated she can schedule a floor plan so she remembers that portion of it. She said she had one beer, which sounds very contrived by her attorneys because she didnít want to say she was drunk and she was a participant in it. So letís say she did have one beer and Kavanaugh and Judge had been drinking.They obviously had a lot of alcohol in their system, and 30 minutes later she decides sheíd gotta go to bathroom, according to her. So theyíre obviously more drunk than they were when she got there. So theyíre beyond belligerent. Theyíre beyond inebriated. So thereís four or five people in there, whatever she determines ó you know, whichever way the windís blowing ó whenever sheís writing the article. Thereís no music on downstairs. So in an unfamiliar house, she goes upstairs to find a bathroom.Thereís no bathroom on the first floor? There wasnít a half bath there? What was she doing, going to take a shower? She goes upstairs for some reason by herself, and these two belligerent and inebriated boys that were making all kinds of racket somehow snuck up behind her without her knowing and pushed her into a bedroom. Because she didnít turn around, she couldnít hear anything behind her with these boys that were just totally drunk and out of control.But somehow, they made it up the steps behind her, and they were super quiet. So they push her into this bedroom, they push her down on the bed, and for some reason in this bedroom thereís music playing, according to her, when thereís nobody in there. So the music isnít playing downstairs where the people are. The music is playing upstairs and Kavanaugh cranks the music so itís real loud, so when he puts his hand over her mouth no one can hear her scream.Okay? So heís got this loud music up. She eventually gets away and runs into the bathroom thatís off the bedroom and she says she locks the door. Now, did she say Kavanaugh after this ó if heís trying to rape her ó comes over and jiggles the handle? You know, he donít (sic) want to be shut down. Did he jiggle the handle? No. What did he do? He and Mark Judge went over, turned the music down so she could hear them, not only óRUSH: Hold your thought. I gotta break. Hold your thought. Right at that very moment.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Pat in Chicago. Please resume where you were. Kavanaugh had just turned down the music in the bedroom, which was the only room in the house apparently during the party where there was music on.CALLER: Right. After his attempted rape ó which weíre told by the professionals that rape is about power, rape is about control. So after he is stymied of raping this girl and she gets away from him and escapes and goes into the bedroom ó Iím sorry, to the bathroom thatís off the bedroom and locks the door, what does he do? Does he try and take away more power from her? No. He turns down the music so she can hear whatís going on so she knows that itís safe for her to come out, and she claims that she could hear íem going down and bouncing off the walls.They werenít bouncing off the walls when they came up, they were stealthy. But when they went down they were bouncing off the walls, which gave her an opportunity to escape. So she unlocks the bathroom door, and instead of immediately going over, closing the bedroom door and locking it ó ícause you know itís the same lock; so if you can get through the bedroom door, you can get through the bathroom door ó and looking for a phone in the bedroom and saying, ìHey, so-and-so, you brought me to this party. You dropped me off.ìIím having some problems here with a guy. I need you to come pick me up right now. I donít feel safe.î Does she do that? No! What does she do? She walks downstairs, and according to her testimony knowing that she had to walk past them, walked out outside. Now, Kavanaughís this great athlete; right? So what prevented him from chasing her? Why would she go outside? Why would she open herself up to that? Sheís in a strange neighborhood.She canít even define where this house is. She goes outside not having any mode of transportation to take her anywhere that she wants to go, and she goes outside by herself. Did she take her friend with her? Whereís Leland? Why didnít she say, ìLeland, he just tried to attack me! Stay with me until I get somewhere safe.î Did she do that? No, she doesnít. To piggyback off what you said, after being freed and sheís safe, wouldnít you think she would know what happened next after that?RUSH: Well, thatís the thing. I mean, picking up where you left off, the thing that is really hard to believe is that she canít remember how she got away from there!CALLER: Because she was never there.RUSH: She canít remember how she got home. I donít know how you would forget that. How would youÖ? Thatís your escape! Thatís how you get to safety. Thatís how you rewrap yourself in your cocoon of security. She canít remember that. She would have had to have made decisions. Was she gonna walk, catch a cab, call mom and dad, hitchhike, ask somebody at the party, ìIs there somebody who can drive me?î We donít know. She canít tell us how she got out of there.CALLER: So in this case, you know, itís basically her ìwitnesses,î quote, unquote. They will not corroborate what sheís saying. Her best friend ó this Leland who was her best friend ó said it never happened. She was never there.RUSH: Right.CALLER: Now, in a case like this, letís say itís, ìhe said, she said.î In a case like that thatís 35-year-olds, in my book plausibility determines credibility, and if anybody finds her story plausible, theyíre sick in the head.RUSH: Well, itís more than that. This story ó uncorroborated, no evidence, no witnesses. Is this what you will use to disqualify a nominee about whom everything else in life we know? We know his achievements. We know his decisions. We know his writings. Through six FBI investigations, we know everything there is to know about this guy except for this one tale which canít be corroborated, for which thereís no evidence. Are we gonna keep a guy off the court for that, balancing this, what weíre hearing today against what we know about the rest of and the entirety of his life?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Lindsey Graham was just being interviewed by the media, the media scrum following the break in the hearings, and he was fit to be tied over this. He said he didnít hear one thing to change anything, that she didnít corroborate anything. She did not. He doesnít doubt anything happened to her, but Kavanaugh is unequivocal it didnít happen. Heís got three witnesses that say they werenít there when Ford says they were there. He made the point (summarized), ìThey want an FBI investigation?ìYou couldnít even get a search warrant for this because she doesnít know where it happened! She doesnít know where it happened, she doesnít know precisely when it happened, she doesnít know how she got home when it was over.î He thought that the Republican prosecutor had done a good job. I donít think the Republican prosecutor had enough time to close her case. Thatís just me. We go back to the phones now to Washington. Kathryn, youíre next. I really appreciate your waiting, and hello.CALLER: Hi. How are you, Rush?RUSH: Fine and dandy. Thank you very much.CALLER: I was just calling in because I am similar to Christine Ford in some ways. I have a PhD, I went to a really excellent college, and 20 years ago, I was raped. But what is different about me is that there is no way I would ruin that manís life. I mean, Iíve forgiven him, and Iíve had to do that to get on with my life. The idea that someone would say something just to ruin their life is just wrong.RUSH: This is why the Republican prosecutor was attempting to establish, that Christine Ford is the product of a Democrat Party operation, because the Democrat Party will destroy people to stop their opponents from winning. Youíre not a political person. You donít think this way. They do! This is exactly how they think. They are using her. She didnít come forward on her own; I donít care what anybody says. Theyíre using her to get this done.CALLER: And itís so insulting to people that were actually raped, I have to say (chuckles), and itís so insulting to people with any kind of human decency. Thatís óRUSH: Well, weíre notÖ (chuckles) Again, you know, I may be out onÖ This is not thin ice. Weíre not dealing with decency here. We are in the mire and muck of politics where indecency is the objective of the Democrat Party whenever politics is involved, and thatís why youíre having trouble relating. You canít see yourself destroying the life of your rapist, even though some people wouldnít blame you!CALLER: No. IÖ (chuckles) You know, you sound just like my husband, which is funny, because he listens to you all the time. And, you know, he says the same thing. Heís like, ìYou just donít get it. I canít try and explain to you how a liberal thinks,î and thatís why I started listening. Heís listened to your show for years but Iíve recently started listening more so that I can be aware, because itís just so mind-blowing, if I could say anything.RUSH: I know exactly what you canít relate to, and thatís precisely because youíre not cut from that cloth. Many people are. Hang on, Kathryn. I want to just say one more thing to you.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Kathryn, Washington. Youíre back. I want to share something with you. You admitted that your husband is telling you how political the left is or Democrats are and you have trouble recognizing it. Youíre not alone there. I want to share with you maybe a way to help you understand just who they are and a way to maybe help you logically spot it when you see it. My whole life, I have been struggling to find the way to tell people who are not as politically oriented as I am or not political junkies what liberalism is and who liberals are and why they are a danger.Because most people donít look at peopleís ideology. They judge other things. I finally stumbled acrossÖ Iíve always had this in the back of my mind, but Iíve never been able to come up with the words. I was reading a little blurb by a columnist at National Review named Jim Geraghty, and he nailed it. It was not a big, long piece. It was almost kind of like a throwaway line. Essentially, he said that it struck him that what liberalism is ó what the Democrat Party is ó is people with psychological disorders who are now politicizing those disorders and blaming various institutions or America at large for their disorders.CALLER: Mmm-hmm.RUSH: And Iím telling you, that isÖ As far as I look at them, I think itís exactly right, and thatís why so much of liberalism is tough to understand because it defies logic. People try to say, ìWell, thatís just who liberals are,î but it doesnít make sense to you because it defies logic. But the way to give you an example. What is the Black Lives Matter movement? Itís hatred of all cops.CALLER: Right.RUSH: The theory is these are groups made up of people who may have had a bad experience with cops. Maybe theyíve been affected by it one way or the other and theyíve got some kind of disorder related to it, and they blow it up into being all cops are bad and all of America that supports authority is bad. But when they enter the political realm with it for solutions and answers is when people lose understanding. You know, if youíve got a psychological disorder, deal with it somewhere else. Itís not politicsís responsibility to deal with all of these various problems that people have.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: And if you look at the constituency groups in the Democrat Party, itís one group after another which are not happy. Theyíre constantly miserable. They just ó they ó (sigh)CALLER: Blame other people for their problems.RUSH: Oh, yeah. Thatís part of it. Victimology.CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: So that, to me, nailed it even though itís one of those things where when I saw that characterization? Bingo! Itís what Iíve always thought, never was able to come up with the words myself to express it. I mean, look at the arguments we are having. I mean, we are shutting down states. Weíve got boycotts of states over the fact that some states wanted to pass a law saying that boys couldnít use the girlsí bathroom and vice-versa. Weíre in the midst of a hearing over whether or not somebody should be denied a seat on the court because heís been accused of sexual abuse.Yet the same people think itís okay for little boys and little girls to go to the bathroom together because they have to accommodate the latest fad or cause which is transgenderism and so forth. And itís things like thatÖ Militant feminism? Itís irrational. These women are angry. Something has happened to them in their lives, and their rage and anger, they take it out now on the country or on all men or men in ìthe powerful majority,î which is white Christian men and so forth. How do you deal with psychological disorders?You canít when it enters the political arena, because psychological disorders, those are victims of something, and they areÖ So politics now has to make an accommodation for all of this, and there just isnít any common ground. The Democrats are using all of this to win elections and to advance and change definitions of morality and normalcy and so forth. You just try to look at things you donít understand and rather than say, ìThatís just the Democrats.î No. Thereís a reason for it, and they are embracing and promoting these various psychological disorders as legitimate political causes.These people in these groups are happy for the Democrats to take it on because the Democrats promise íem theyíre gonna fix it. The Democrats promise to fix it, and fixing it means getting even the people who did whatever was done to them. So it becomes the politics of punishment and revenge and gettingí even with people who didnít do anything to anybody! Affirmative action! And not just with African-Americans. Affirmative action with women. People who have never mistreated anybody get punished, by virtue of new policy that is enacted to appease the Democrat Party sponsoring this stuff.And it creates an ongoing war in the country.Groups of people end up being pitted against one way or another precisely because of all this, and thatís why there isnít any common ground. Thatís why there is no more crossing the aisle and cooperating and understanding and so forth, because the people on the left have no interest in cooperation or getting along. They want blood. They want vengeance. They want punishment for whoever it is that did whatever happened to them.And the Democrat Party is right there to make them think that theyíre gonna get it done. Itís sad. It really is. But look. Kathryn, thank you. Iím glad you called. Itís not easy for you to call here and say what you said and to enter into this discussion. You know, they told Dr. Ford she was brave today for doing what she did. So are you. Iím glad you called.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/27/fords-curious-answers-on-her-polygraph-test/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 27, 2018RUSH: We continue our assessment here of the hearings so far. And, remember, Kavanaugh has yet to come, yet to appear. He will go last, and itís gonna go on for much of the rest of the afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We, as a note to our affiliatesÖ I know many of you are going wall-to-wall with this. We here at the EIB Network understand. We, obviously, will not. We are interspersing. We are joining it in progress here and there, salient comments from me in real time as the hearings take place.I want to share just a few more observations with you and then we get to your phones because theyíre in a lunch break right now and theyíll come back, eh, probably in 20 minutes or so and resume. The media. I have done a quick survey during the break here at the top of the hour. On the media, I donít care where you go ó you go to Fox, you go to CNN, you go anywhere ó they think that the Republicans are blowing it.That theyíre not accomplishing anything, that the prosecutor and this technique is a total waste of time, that the Democrats are hitting home run after home run after home run after home run. That is the media assessment. If you go to social media and you take a quick perusal there, you find a different picture. I found some Facebook people (and there are some serious discussions out there) who believe ó and these are not media people.Itís just the American people watching this on TV who think that the prosecutor is scoring a lot of points because the prosecutor is catching Dr. Ford in a lot of inconsistencies, is exposing a lot of inconsistencies and a lot of what might be lies. That Dr. Ford is making her memory explicitly clear on a few things and on other things not at all. That is an inconsistency. She does appear to remember what she wants to remember pretty well, but it is random. For example, she doesnít know who paid for her polygraph.I have never taken a polygraph. Mr. Snerdley, does anybody know how much they cost? I donít know how much a polygraph costs. I didnít have time to check during the break. You might assume theyíre relatively expensive, but maybe not. It was at an off-site location. It was in a hotel conference room near an airport. It was done secretly. She doesnít know who paid for it. Her description of it was unnerving. Her description of the polygraph was similar to her description of the assault.She was nervous and crying, and she described it as being all over her body and that the polygraph official, the guy who took the polygraphÖ She described him as being behind her. (impression) ìHe was behind meeeee.î She felt very closed in in this process. Now, the guy that did the polygraph was on Fox last night and said there were only two questions. Shannon Bream on Fox had the polygraph expert on last night, the guy who administered it, and there were only two questions.But she made it sound like it was a traumatic experience. She doesnít know who paid for it. No oneís asking about that. Thereís a lot of questions that are not being asked here. One really curious thing, to me, is she said she didnít know that Senator Grassley had offered to send Judiciary Committee staff to California. When they found out sheís afraid of flying and couldnít come to Washington, she was invited. It was in the media. It was everywhere.It was widely known that the committee had made every effort to get to her, including offering to fly out there. She claimed not to know that! She seemed to be genuinely surprised by that today. Now, why doesnít she know that? Did her lawyers not tell her that? Did her lawyers withhold the Senate Judiciary Committee offer from her? When this all came up, one of her attorneys jumped to the microphone and the attorney, Katz (the Democrat, Soros-funded activist) covered Dr. Fordís microphone with her hand and would not let her answer this question.And then eventually they had these little powwows and Dr. Ford said (impression), ìOh, I ó I ó I would have gladly welcomed you to my home ifÖ IímÖî Look, Iím notÖ This is just how she speaks. You know me; Iím an impressionist here, folks. She has a speech pattern. I donít want to repeat myself on that.  Iíve addressed it twice in the previous hour. But she has a definite speech pattern called up-talking, which emphasizesÖ You raise your tone on the last word of the sentence. It promotes vulnerability, youth. (demonstrating) ìItís how young girls talk?îEverythingís open-ended, unsure. Itís totally innocent. UmÖ (interruption) Itís $200 to $800 for a typical two-hour polygraph. Walmart sells a polygraph machine for a hundred bucks. If you want the Mac Daddy, itís 121 bucks. (interruption) ìCan you get the Mac Daddy at Walmart?î Yeah, IÖ (interruption) But isÖ?

Some polygraph machines cost $2,000.Okay, itís like an EKG machine. You can get an EKG machine on your watch now, you know, for 400 bucks, but a real EKG machine is gonna seat you back thousands. I donít know. She didnít know. She professed not to know that the committee had offered to come to California. So I donít know if her lawyers didnít tell her because they didnít wantÖ The whole point of this has been delay, delay, delay, delay. Hereís another thing. A bunch of leftist media types are saying, ìDoes this woman look like a leftist hack?ìDoes this woman look like somebody whoís part of a leftist conspiracy whoís trying to bring down a conservative? She doesnít come cross that way at all!î She does to me. Iím sorry, but thatís exactly how she comes across. This is who they are, if you ask me! But remember, I am a lifelong student of the left. I know them as well as they know themselves. Maybe I know them better, because many of them are not honest about who and what they actually are. Many left-wing activists donít think theyíre left wing.Many of them donít even think theyíre activists. There is no such thing as liberalism. They just are whatís right. They are just whatís normal. This hearing today does not change my perception that we, on the right, donít really know what weíre up against. And itís not entirely our fault. But I do believe that liberalism ó what everybody thinks it is ó has kind of been taken over by what I think are people who have legitimate psychological disorders, and they have now sought the realm of politics to address those disorders and grievances.So liberalism has basically become the home of people with psychological disorders and problems, and the Democrat Party has become their champion. Part and parcel of this is becoming a victim, and when you become a victim, nothing is ever your fault, and being a failure or being less than you can be or whatever? Itís not your fault. Itís somebody elseís. Thereís always somebody to blame for what you arenít, somebody to blame for what you are, somebody to blame for what has happened to you, somebody to blame for what wasnít happened to you.It is the normalization of psychological disorders that is what weíre up against here in many ways. This is a woman who has a doctorate in some kind of psychology and did not know what ìexculpatoryî means. She was being askedÖ A Democrat senator was setting her up for a grand-slam home run. ìYou realize coming forward that with an FBI investigationÖî The Democrats are making a big deal over the fact there hasnít been one, and theyíre trying to make it look like sheís very brave for asking for an FBI investigation.ìBecause you realize, Dr. Ford, that an FBI investigation could produce evidence that would substantiate yourself case?î ìOh, yes, sir!î ìAnd youíre aware that an FBI investigation could also come up with exculpatory evidence?î (impression) ìUhhh, Iím sorry, Senator. I ó I donít know whatÖ Exculpatory? What ó what is that?î And Iím saying, ìHow can that be?î But then Ocasio-Cortez, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has a degree in economics from Boston University and doesnít know the first thing about it.

When this is over, every bit of what Dr. Ford is saying here will remain uncorroborated. Every bit of it. When sheís finished, there isnít a single witness that can or has corroborated what sheís saying. In the interval between now and the end of this, Judge Kavanaugh will have his time before the committee.Heíll have his opening statement, heíll have the questions, and the prosecutor will not be asking him any questions. Sheís just there to query Dr. Ford. So itís gonna boil down to who you believe. Itís gonna boil down to who has more credibility, and Chris Wallace at Fox News has weighed in that he believesÖ Iíve already lost the number of the bite. But youíve got that, I know. Yeah, here it is. This is Chris Wallace during the break about half an hour ago, his initial reaction to thisÖWALLACE: So far, weíve heard from six people: Rachel Mitchell three times for three senators, three Democratic senators speaking for themselves. This is a disaster for the Republicans. Youíre exactly right. She is treating this like a deposition, like a court hearing. She hasnít gotten anything from this woman. Meanwhile, the Democrats are landing haymakers. ìWhat do you remember most?î ìI remember the laughter of the boys as they were laughing at my expense.î ìTo what degree of certainty do you know that it was Brett Kavanaugh?î ìWith a hundred percent certainty!îRUSH: There. So that reaction is probably pretty common throughout the media, and the reason is that thereís so high expectations here. There isnít any corroborating evidence. The womanís got holes in the story. Her dates and times are unknown, unconfirmed. And yet none of that has been exposed. None of it! None of her flaws. None of the inaccuracies, inconsistencies in her story have yet been exposed.Some people think, ìYou know what? This is a bad idea. Senators ought to be asking the questions.î Folks, itís six of one, half dozen of the other. If male Republican senators were bearing in and bearing down on her, you know what the reaction to that would be. They have decided, Iím sure, that the overall atmosphere here is not going to be interpreted as unfair or the witness being bullied.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Richard Blumenthal is falling all over himself right now in his five minutes, the senator from Connecticut. (impression) ìI believe you. This is such a teachable moment. Youíre a great teacher and I think youíre very brave. Youíre so courageous. I remember when I lied to people about having served with valor in Vietnam, and I believed that lie for a long time until it was called out on me. But my voters donít care! I was elected anyway.îNow, he didnít say that, but thatís what I think when Iím watching the guy, because thatís who he is. So itís hard to stay focused on what really matters here. In some cases, itís hard to know what does matter. The purpose of this is to get beyond it so that there can be a vote on Kavanaugh tomorrow. Well, is whatís happening here today going to move that forward and facilitate that or not? Now, in that regard, is it the television impact of this or the substance of this (assuming theyíre gonna be different things) that will move the vote tomorrow?Thatís gonna be totally up to Grassley and how he interprets what all happened today. But so far, in her opening statement and in all of the preguntas that she has been asked and all the things sheís answered, there isnít a shred of anything new, ladies and gentlemen. There is nothing new. There is not a new memory of anything of substance. There is not a new fact. There isnít a new recollection that would buttress something previously not quite remembered.Thereís none of that.Nothing new.Nothing definitive.And at the end of it, none of it will have been corroborated. Not a single bit of Dr. Fordís allegations to this day have been corroborated. From the beginning of this, every allegation she made has been uncorroborated. The Democrats, the media even tried to play a trick with that this week by saying, ìWell, thereís affidavits from four people who she told the story to. Four people have corroborated what happened!î No, they didnít ìcorroborate what happened.î They corroborated that she told them what happened.There isnít any corroboration for this whatsoever, and there isnít going to be. Does Brett Kavanaugh have a way of blowing all this up and having people begin to question Dr. Fordís assertions here and her credibility as Justice Thomas did during the Anita Hill hearings? You know, Iím like everybody else watching this with random observations here, and her voice is one. She sounds very young. She didnít know what the word ìexculpatoryî meant. She appearedÖ Iím not making this up.She appeared not to know that the Senate would be the ones confirming the nominee and the Judiciary Committee would handle this. She also said that she didnít want to go to the media but did after ìbeach friendsî advised her to go to the Washington Post. So they sent this anonymous thing to the Washington Post. The Washington Post didnít react to it, which means they must not have thought much of it. So when the Washington Post didnít react, they said, ìWell, why donít you try the New York Times.î She was asked, ìWell, did your congresswoman advise you to do this? ìNo!î Very quick with the answer ìnoî on that.

We have Blasey Ford, we have Ramirez, and now we have Swetnick. The Drive-Bys and the advocates that are against Kavanaugh are saying, ìWell, they wouldnít lie! They must be telling the truth. Thereís no way three or four people would lie about the same thing.îOkay.Well, Donald Trump said there was no collusion between him, his campaign, and Russia. Carter Page said that there was no collusion between him and his work and his business and the Russians. Paul Manafort said that there was no collusion. He has no knowledge of any collusion between the Russians and Trump and he didnít do any. So we got three people there who all day long say that there was no collusion. They must be telling the truth, right?Because thereís no way three different people would all lie about the same thing. Does it work that way? Obviously not. I make a facetious point. But if Blasey Ford, Ramirez, and Swetnick tell three disparate, different stories all with the same conclusion that Kavanaugh is some sexual reprobate?ìThey must be telling the truth. Three different people would not lie!îWell, Trump, Manafort, Carter Page all say no collusion. I guess theyíre telling the truth too.  "

Iím glad you waited. Youíre next here on the Rush Limbaugh program. Hi.CALLER: Hello, Rush. How are you?RUSH: Fine. Thank you.CALLER: No one in your audience should be surprised or shocked at what the Democrats are doing. They telegraphed who they were in í91. They nearly destroyed a man ó and that was just a black conservative replacing a black liberal. This confirmation was the most important confirmation in our lifetimes, tipping the court. So what did the GOP do? They put Elmer Fudd at the chair. Republicans canít go for cameras and tell us how flimsy ó including Mitch McConnell, how flimsy ó Blasey Fordís story is without, at the same time, telegraphing how incompetent Grassley was. You canít have it both ways. The Democrats come to fight. They come to battle. Republicans want to be statesmen, and they donít know how to fight. Iíll ask you one question.RUSH: Yeah?CALLER: If Grassley was bribed to sabotage Kavanaughís confirmation, how would it look any different than it looks now?RUSH: (laughing)CALLER: Please, answer me. SomebodyÖ What needs to happen is there needs to be out of this hopefully like a phoenix, conservative óRUSH: Okay.CALLER: We need a national Conservative Party. The GOPís gone. ConservativesÖ I mean, Iím from New York, so we have a separate Conservative Party.RUSH: We donít have that now. Thatís an argument for another day. That doesnít get Kavanaugh on the court.†BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Guess what? (laughing) Elmer Fudd has just opened up the possibility of another hearing to handle this babe thatís come forward today. I say ìElmer Fuddî because our caller from Brooklyn referred to Senator Grassley as ìElmer Fudd.îThe headline (itís Washington Times) is ìCharles Grassley Opens Door to Second Hearing After Third Kavanaugh Accuser Surfaces.î Now, what the caller from Brooklyn meant was, in the game of optics thereís no way the Republicans win this, right? Thatís what he meant. You got Grassley. Take your pick of any of them out there.Jeff Flake is now saying heís getting death threats, and no matter how this ends itís gonna be a cloud over everybody when itís over no matter how the vote goes. People are now starting to dig into Julie Swetnick. Well, theyíre digging into her story. You have to be really careful here.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This is Hannah in Hartsville, South Carolina.

Iím a conservative Millennial here in South Carolina, and I just want to tell you Iím so grateful for your voice. It is so needed; we couldnít do it without.RUSH:  Well, thank you very much.CALLER:  To get on to my question, I wanted to see if you thought that there were any indicators on how Murkowski, Collins, and Flake will vote.  You know, we have this sideshow going, but it really comes down to what happens on Friday morning.  I also want to know, do you thinkÖ? Since Grassley went ahead and scheduled the vote for Friday morning, do you think that thatís an indicator that he believes he has the votes to confirm Kavanaugh?RUSH:  Normally, I would say yes to that.  I think for the most part, yeah, you could think that thatís what Chairman Grassley believes.  But this wrench thrown into the mix today is going to, I think, kind of confuse whatever thinking existed.  The hearing tomorrow is just Blasey Ford.  Now weíve got this latest edition brought to us by the porn star attorney, and it may be the tipping point.  This may be the jumping-the-shark moment in all this.  As for Murkowski and Collins, nobody knows how theyíre leaning.  They havenít said.  Murkowski, however, has backed off one thing.  Earlier in the week, Senator Murkowski was suggesting that an FBI investigation into Blasey Fordís incident would be very helpful. I mean, if the FBI could look into this and declare something, it would be very helpful.  She has since walked back her demand for an FBI investigation and she is saying this is not about a Supreme Court nomination; this is about whether or not a woman is to be believed.  That was Senator Murkowski.  Senator Collins is holding her decision or cards closer to the vest.  In my mind, I donít know how either of these women can look at whatís happening today and in any way side with the Democrats on this. But Iím not there and Iím not them.  "

This is Diane. Thank you for waiting. Itís your turn.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Thank you for taking my call.RUSH: Yes, maíam.CALLER: So I am a converted-by-my-husband conservative. So Iíve been paying attention to this Kavanaugh business. Iím listening, reading, and just looking at this woman, the new accuser and her accusations, the first thing that popped into my head ó which you may have already answered in your last segment ó was, ìIf sheís truly seeking justice,î which is what we have to assume they would be doing, ìwhy wouldnít she have named the man who actually raped her or held her down or any of that, but possibly a couple of guys who were standing in line in maybe another room, if thatís how she described it all? Doesnít she see that this is just making such a mockery of women who actually have validÖ?RUSH: No. Iím convinced that thereís notÖ People give lip service to that aspect of this, but obviously thatís not a factor or none of this would be happening at all. If people were worried about the effect this is having on women who really, really have been abused and raped and mistreated, thatís nothing but words. I donít thinkÖ It sounds good and it makes you look like youíre thoughtful and so forth, but I donít think that enters into anybodyís minds on the Democrat side in this. Thatís out the window.Your question, however, she is at these ìrape trainî parties and after the tenth one it happens to her but she only remembers the guy standing around. She only remembers the guy who spiked the punch but she doesnít remember the guy who did the nasty. Now, maybe because she was scared, panicked, traumatized, drunk, drugged, or what have you. It was dark. There could be any number of explanations for that. But you still do remember two other people.How do you do that? How do you so easily remember the two people that werenít actually doing that? They just were in the setup phase like the grounds crew, you know, getting the playing field ready to go, and they go to the dugout while the action happens. You remember those guys. But you donít remember the perp. Thatís a good question, Diane. Do you have an answer yourself for it? Can you put yourself in her shoes and how would that be?CALLER: Well, other than stating the obvious, that it seems to be a possible witch hunt and that sheís just being used. Like you said, you had a caller yesterday who theyíve been looking for people to do this all summer. So she just happens to be somebody willing to step up and put herself out there. But to me itís just unbelievable because sheís a woman and if she had a valid complaint, you would think she would have come forward long before this.RUSH: Well, she had to make sure her coming forward made a difference, mattered.CALLER: Right.RUSH: It had to be after everything else had bombed out. You have an interesting pedigree. You said you were a relatively new conservative. You used to be a liberal; is that right?CALLER: That is correct.RUSH: Okay. How long ago was it that your transmogrification occurred?CALLER: (giggles) Well, it wasnít that recent. When I started dating my husband, he listened to you daily. We probably still have boxes of cassette tapes of your show in your garage somewhere.RUSH: You need to send those to Legacybox. You need to save those! Can you still listen to those? You still have a cassette player?CALLER: Oh, sure, we have cassette players. (giggles)RUSH: Oh, okay. All right. Okay. Well, the reason Iím asking is because, as former liberal, thatís what you were born as, and so you probably still have certain things that tug at the suppressed or defeated overcome liberalism within your being. Does this tempt you to go back to liberalism? Does this sour you on conservatism or conservatives, that itís only ó not only, but these are the guys being accused, other than Weinstein and the hollered people? Does it worry you or do you think itís all bogus?CALLER: Oh, it doesnít worry me in the least bit. It only gives me a stronger conviction of what the Democrat Party is capable of, and the sad thing is, Rush, that they wouldÖ You know, I have very good friends, very good friends, family members ó very liberal, very snowflakish ó and you canít say a word around them. But the problem is, they donít actually listen. So the way that I was able to actually continue dating my husband was I started listening to your program because if I didnít, I had no ammunition to, you know, fight back with. But, you know, strangely enough the transformation happened after I started listening because you start realizing that youíre missing out on a big portion of the story of whatís actually happening. So, no, not at all. This does just the opposite to me.RUSH: Good. Iím glad to hear that, because as a transmogrified conservative, thereís always a temptation toÖ I have a theory. Itís actually not mine. Itís John OíSullivanís, who was an aide to Margaret Thatcher, an editor at National Review. Itís called the Sullivan law, theorem, doctrine, or whatever. It basically says that any person or group that is not actively, daily conservative will become liberal. Because itís the most gutless choice you can make. It doesnít take any intellect commitment at all. All you have to do is feel. Conservatism isÖ Even though itís just flat-out nothing more than common sense, given the pop culture dominance of liberalism, conservatism is a fight. Itís an active, daily pursuit. And the fact that youíre able to hold on to your conservatism in the midst of all this? This is heartening to me.CALLER: Well, it shouldnít be that difficult actually. Like you say, itís common sense, and the informationís out there for everyone, but itís totally easier to be liberal and just to feel good about, you know, everything thatís going on and that you want to do, but óRUSH: Now, wait. See, thatís veryÖ They donít. They feel. Itís easy to be a liberal because you look at suffering, ìOh, my gosh, I hate that.î That makes you a good person. Doesnít take much to be a good person in liberalism. All you have to do is suffer. See suffering and suffer. You donít have to fix it, you donít have to solve it, you donít have to do anything but find out somebody to blame for it. ó and it makes you a good person. But I didnít say youíre happy.Theyíre not happy. There isnít a one of them thatís happen. They donít even laugh! They are in constant state of rage or anger. As discussed yesterday, liberalism is reallyÖ Itís encroached on our politics, but itís a psychological disorder. And they have various psychological maladies and distorted which they have entered the political process in an attempt to get even, fix, punish whoever is responsible for whatís ever happened to people. And in that senseÖI just saw Jeff Flake speaking from the floor of the Senate talking about how our politics has just become so debased. Our politics is so low and weíve got to stop it. This isnít gonna stop. The debasement of our politics, the debasement of our system is not gonna stop until the psychological disorders that are liberalism are kept out of politics and solved and fixed and addressed somewhere else. But as long as psychological disorders become embraced by the Democrat Party with promises of government solutionsÖThe reason theyíre never happy is ícause they never get any of these problems solved. They never get anything fixed, and when they do get what they want, itís never enough. So as long asÖ Iím being literal here. Itís a theory Jim Geraghty had at National Review, and I happen to understand it and I agree with it. As long as psychological disorders become evidence of political bias, discrimination, and unfairness, we donít have any hope. When the political system is blamed for and then responsible for addressing and fixing what are psychological disorders, thereís no hope. Thatís not what politics is. But it is what itís become.And that is why, you know, decent or normal people, however youÖ I think most people know what decency and normalcy is, versus indecency and abnormal. But as long as the indecent and abnormal can overwhelm the system with their disorders and demand that the purpose of government and politics is to address these disordersÖ Remember these disorders result from these people are victims because somebodyís done something to íem. Somebody was mean to íem, mistreated them or whatever.ìThe political system has to fix that!î (sigh) That canít happen. Weíve been trying. Weíve had the Great Society. We have had you name it. Weíve had government programs to address every freaking liberal problem there is, and all theyíve done is become more widespread. Theyíve not become fixed or repaired because it canít be done. So liberalism now proceeds on the basis that there are people responsible for the unhappiness, the misery, the inequality, the injustice that the psychologically disordered are feeling.That happens to be us, folks. We conservatives, Christians, are largely responsible for the unhappiness and misery because weíre racist, sexist, bigotÖ You know the drill. So we have to be erased. We have to be eliminated, because weíre mean-spirited and all that, and the political system then has to accommodate. And since the political system canít fix any of these disorders, they have to be treated or accommodated ó which usually is money and punishment aimed at people who are said to be responsible for the unhappiness.So thatís how you get Black Lives Matter hating cops. Thatís how you get militant activists on the left hating religion, and any of the other institutions that have defined America and its greatness. Itís why the Constitution is not safe. They believe the Constitution in it has it inbred unfairness and discrimination and so forth. So that pretty much sums it up. But you wouldnít even find a lot of agreement with the principles Iíve just stated, the concepts. But I think theyíre undeniable.  "

Nobody has found out what you were doing on the ìrape trains.îBut now, Donaldus Trump calls and nominates you to the U.S. Supreme Court, and youíre starting to think, ìOkay. I know how the Democrats play. Theyíre not gonna want me on this court. Theyíre gonna do anything. They canít refute my qualifications. I can run rings around íem judicially, intellectually, but I remember what they did to Judge Thomas. I donít know how Iím gonna keep the ërape trainsí from íem. I better not accept the nomination.îWould you accept the nomination to the Supreme Court if you had a history of spiking punch with drugs and booze for the purposes of preparing women for ìrape trainsî minimum 10 times where you went to high school in Montgomery County, Maryland? Would you do it? (interruption) You would? There is noÖ (laughing) Snerdleyís bobbing his ahead. Youíre just agreeing with me, I see. Thereís no way! If you have this in your background? Thereís no way.By the way, could you even get confirmed for the D.C. Circuit if you had this? And why is it that only a porn star lawyer can find these people who have the evidence of the ìrape trainî? No evidence! Iím sorry. There isnít any evidence. Whatís the good answer for it?

This is from the WashingtonÖ (interruption)Yeah, yeah, yeah, Snerdley. Be patient. Iím gonna get to the ìvagina ghettoî here in just a second. The Washington Post, Jessica Contrera and Ian Shapira: ìChristine Blasey Fordís Family Has Been Nearly Silent Amid Outpouring of Support ó The letters appeared within days of Christine Blasey Fordís name becoming public. One was from her high school classmates. One was from her colleagues at Stanford University.ìHer Palo Alto neighbors wrote another letter. Groups of attorneys, statisticians and teenagers wrote too. Then came a letter that began, ëAs members of Christine Blasey Fordís family Öí It was signed by a dozen people. But none of them were related to Ford by blood. The letter was from the relatives of her husband, Russell Ford. Christineís own parents and siblings ó the Blaseys ó have not released any similar statement of support.ìAs their daughter and sister has become the countryís most talked-about woman for accusing Ö Kavanaugh of sexual assault while both were in high school, the Blaseys have strategically avoided the press. Voicemails, texts, emails and letters from reporters have gone unanswered. Friends of the family have politely declined to comment on what they are going through. Ö The Blasey familyís reticence is notable amid the outpouring of support for Ford as the 51-year-old research psychologist from California prepares to testify ThursdayÖîHer family has not sent in or signed letters of support. What does this mean? Does it mean anything? (interruption) What does it mean, then? If you think it means something, what does it mean? (interruption) Tell me what it means! (interruption) I meansÖ? (interruption) TheyÖ? (interruption) ìThey know her better than anybody else.î Are you saying theyíre refusing to sign because they may not think that sheísÖ? (interruption)So her family and her siblings know her better than anybody else, and from that we can conclude ó and then we can have it corroborated ó that her familyís reticent, uneasy, nervous about becoming signatories to the, ìI know it happened and I know it happened to her,î letter. Okay, Lara Bazelon (I donít know how to pronounce this), op-ed writer, New York Times: ìMan Up, Grassley. Question Blasey Ford Yourself.î This is the convoluted aspect this.When this first came up, when the hearing was first discussed, the left immediately said, ìYou old white guys, you old white Republicans, you canít question her. Sheíll be nervous enough. You canít! Weíre not gonna let happen to her what happened to Anita Hill. You canít question her!î So Grassley said, ìOkay. We are going to be fair.î So Grassley goes out and hires a female prosecutor with experience in sexual abuse and sex crime cases.And now comes this woman, Lara Bazelon, saying (paraphrased exchange), ìWell, you canít do that! You canít bring in a woman to answer these questions from outside the Senate. You need to have senators do it!î Grassleyís scratching his head, saying, ìWait a minute. You said and you said andÖî So this woman writes, ìDr. Blasey and her lawyers have pushed back, demanding that Mr. Grassley and his colleagues question her themselves. They are right to do so. The Republicansí attempt to outsource the questioning of Dr. Blasey is cynical, sexist and cowardly. ÖìThey donít want to be seen grilling Dr. Blasey in front of tens of millions of Americans. Weíve watched that horror movie before, during the Hill-Thomas hearings in 1991, presided over by the Democrats. No one seems anxious for a sequel.î This is like the written word of this Lara Bazelon babe. ìBut the solution isnít to remove men from the script. Itís to ask thatî these men, these old white guy Republicans, ìembody different characters: people who can pose respectful, probing questions, rather than bullies intent on shaming and demeaning the witness.îWe reserve that right to do that to Kavanaugh. The Democrats on the committee will shame and demean and bully Kavanaugh. But you canít shame and demean and bully Blasey! Weíre not gonna permit it. ìWhether it was female prosecutors clustered in rape and child-abuse units or suddenly becoming very in demand when it came to time to cross-examine plaintiffs Ö the consensus was that ëit takes a woman to know a woman.í Again and again, women are told that these are their only real opportunities in courtrooms ó and now, apparently, Senate hearings.îBy this, this woman writes about the unfairness of women litigators, women lawyers in court. Thatís her expertise, her level of expertise. She writes about the abuse and the unfairness and the impossible mountain to climb that women lawyers have. ìAgain and again, women are told that these are their only real opportunities in courtrooms ó and now, apparently, Senate hearings.ìWhat looks like an invitation for advancement may actually be enclosure in what I call the Vagina Ghetto, a restricted space outside of which women are not welcome. We need to stop reinforcing this tired trope.î If it still doesnít make sense to you what the ìVagina Ghettoî is, be patient.  "

Rush Limbaugh here behind the Golden EIB Microphone with apologies in advance for where the left and the Democrats are taking the content of this program. Right smack-dab into Smut Central! Right smack-dab into the filthiest, grimiest gutter you can find and whatever is beneath it. On todayís program, we will learn what a ìvagina ghettoî is as written about in a NewÖ(interruption) Yes, a ìvagina ghetto.î We will learn about this as written about by an op-ed writer in the New York Times. I mean, when you hear that termÖ What do you first think of when you hear ìvagina ghettoî? (interruption) Well, it may be what youíre thinking. (chuckles) Weíll let you know when we get there. Did I say or not say that Christine Blasey Ford would not testify tomorrow? (interruption)Right, and you continued to think that that was crazy because at some point she has to testify, to which point I said, ìNo, she never has to testify because all of this is about stringing it out.î Well, the latest and the reason why ó and again, I apologize, my friends, but we have to go there. The lawyer for the porn star Stormy Daniels (whose suit against Trump may be thrown out of court in Los Angeles) has now produced a woman who claims that at parties back when Kavanaugh was in high school women were drugged and given grain alcohol in the punch so as to set up ìrape trains.îThe woman has been identity by name and by photograph. Her name is Julie Swetnick, and Avenatti announced all of this on The View this morning. Two sound bites. Here is Co-Host Sunny Hostin asking (stammers), ìDid ó did ó did Kavanaugh do anything to this particular woman, Julie Swetnick, or is she alleging she just had seen him be aggressive with other women?îAVENATTI: The allegation[s], if you read further in the declaration, are far more specific relating Brett Kavanaughís conduct towards women in general, including the attempts to drug women by placing grain alcohol and/or drugs in, basically, the punch at these parties. Many of these women ended up gang raped, unfortunately. The details in this declaration are specific. They are shocking. But above all else, they are true, and my client stands behind them 100%. And sheís looking forward to having an opportunity to meet with one or more FBI agents, hopefully, and describe what happened. And sheís also prepared to testify, if sheís permitted to do so, to the U.S. Senate. But under no circumstances should Brett Kavanaugh be confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court until these allegations and others are fully vetted and all of the facts and the truth are known.RUSH: The next question is from Abby Huntsman, co-hostess on The View. ìCan you just explainÖ?î Avenatti, [c]an you just explain again to our viewers and to all of us, since this is just breaking, what specifically did Judge Kavanaugh do to your client?îAVENATTI: Iím gonna stand on the exact language in the declaration. Itís laid out in detail in the declaration. Thereís a reason why itís laid out in the declaration, and weíre not gonna provide any additional comment on that exact question until further ó until the coming days.RUSH: So in this allegation yet again, this particular woman, Julie Swetnick, is not accusing Kavanaugh of doing anything to her! She is interpreting the minds of other women at a high school party. What does ìbecame awareî he spiked drinks even mean? It means she didnít witness it. She ìbecame awareî? It means somebody told her. When did somebody tell her? Monday? Last week?Youíve heard the story going around now that there are affidavits from four people, one of whom is the husband of Blasey Ford. Youíve heard that there are four affidavits ìcorroborating her story.î No, they donít corroborate her story. They corroborate that she told them the story. They donít corroborate. There is no corroboration! This would be akin, ladies and gentlemen, to me coming on this program today and saying that I overheard Barack Obama admit that he ordered the FBI to spy on Trump. I canít remember when or where.Now you can corroborate it for me. Iíve just told somebody. Iíve just told you that I overheard Obama admit he ordered the FBI to spy on Trump, and you can corroborate that. Because you heard me say it. But you canít corroborate that Obama told the FBI to spy on Trump, and this is the trick that is being played here. What weíre learning, if there was ever any doubt, is this third accuser coming forth today on the eve of Blasey Ford supposedly testifying tomorrow, there is no lower limit.There is nothing too ludicrous, thereís nothing too disgusting, thereís nothing too putrid, thereís nothing too perverted that the Democrats will not do to try to smear a person they want to destroy simply because they cannot stand somebody other than one of theirs being on the United States Supreme Court. We shouldnít be surprised. Hillary Clinton claims that Trump hired prostitutes to urinate on hotel bed that the Obamas supposedly slept on.And weíve got an FBI warrant, a FISA warrant to spy on Trump based on that allegation in the dossier. This has gotten so crazy. Do you remember when it was first looking like Christine Blasey Ford was going to show up and testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee? What did the left say? The left said, ìYou canít have a bunch of Republican old white guys question her! You canít have that. That ó that would be horrible. Weíre not gonna allow it.ìWeíre not gonna allow old, white senators to question her.î So Senator Grassley heard that, got the message, and went out and hired a female prosecutor who specializes in these kinds of sexual abuse cases and sheís going to come in and sheís going to ask the questions tomorrow. The Democrats say, ìYou canít do that! You canít bring somebody that has nothing to do with the committee in to ask these questions. Senators ought to be asking the questions!î Well, wait, wait, wait.You just said senators should not be and then Grassley goes out and gets a woman who specializes in this from New Mexico, Arizona, wherever to come in and do it. Now you say she shouldnít do it, that senators should. Itís in that back-and-forth that the term ìvagina ghettoî appears in a New York Times story. The New York Times! Weíre not talking here about supermarket tabloids. Weíre talking about New York Times, and itís a lawyer or some person specializing in the abuse of women who has coined the term.So here are details. I have a Bloomberg version of the story about Wall Street Journal and others. A new accuser against Brett Kavanaugh said the Supreme Court nominee took part,î took part, ìin efforts during high school to get girls intoxicated so that a group of boys could have sex with them. ëI have a firm recollection of seeing boys lined up outside rooms at many of these parties waiting for their ìturnî with a girl inside the room,í Washington resident Julie Swetnick said in a sworn affidavit released by [the porn star] attorney Michael Avenatti.ìëThese boys [that she remembers seeing lined up outside] included Mark Judge and Brett Kavanaugh,í she added.î Avenatti released ìa picture of my client Julie Swetnick. She is courageous, brave and honest. We ask that her privacy and that of her family be respected.î
After Avenatti plasters her photo all over the place! ìSwetnick said she was a victim of one of those incidents in the early 1980s and that Kavanaugh and Judge had been present, though she did not say whether they had sex with her.ìIn other instances, she said in the affidavit, Kavanaugh and Judge made efforts to cause girls ëto become inebriated and disoriented so they could then be ìgang rapedî in a side room or bedroom by a ìtrainî of numerous boys.í The allegation comes one day before Kavanaugh is set to testify at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing along with another accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, who saysÖî Does anybody still think that this thing is gonna happen tomorrow?You know, Iím getting close to revising something, folks. The audio sound bite roster todayÖ Cookie gave me a warning. She said, ìI know you donít like it when the show becomes about you. But of course, Rush, everything is always about you.î Sheís got sound bite after sound bite after sound bite of Sky News, the BBC, Swahili News. All over the world, theyíre playing that sound bite of me (chuckling) claiming the Republicans will lose everything if they donít confirm Kavanaugh. Theyíre playing it all over the place.Sheís given me a lot of new examples of it. Youíve heard the bite. I mention it. You probably heard me state it originally. With this latest revelationÖ You know, I donít use the word ìscumî very often at all. Back in my early formative broadcasting days, I got great advice from people who cared about my future and career and there were various things ó advice things ó I was told. ìDonít say things you donít believe just to get a rise out of people. Donít ever do that. Donít just be outrageous for the sake of it.îThey said, ìBy the way, you donít have to try to be outrageous. You come by it naturally. So donít try. Just donít make things up that you donít believe, and be very careful of the guttural words, descriptive words that you use to describe people,î and ìscumî was one of the words. ìBe very careful how you throw that word around. Itís just four letters but it hits people in a very, very bad way. Just donít let that ever become part of your vocabulary,î and it hasnít.But I donít know how else to describe what this is. This is just the scum, the literal scum of the American left that is rising to their surface. And there isnít a single guilty conscience anywhere in the Democrat Party today that we know of or anywhere on the left for any of this that is being done. We have Senate confirmation hearing that is being looked at as a trial. In the early days of this country and for many, many years after the founding of this country, do you know that the advice and consent roll of the Senate was done by affidavit?The nominees to positions on various courts never showed up. The Senate did not conduct hearings and examinations and this. They just submitted affidavits, the nominees, because the purpose of the advice and consent was to determine the fitness and qualification of whoever the president had appointed. Well, thatís long ago gone by the wayside. Thatís not what this is now, as anybody can tell. I may be having to rethink my belief that Kavanaugh not being confirmed would cause Republicans to not show up. I donít think Republicans would ever vote Democrat. Somebody said, ìRush is crazy. Republicans arenít gonna vote Democrat.îI never said that! I said they wonít show up. They wonít vote Republican if Kavanaugh doesnít get confirmed. But now with this, I think the level of disgust and anger at Washington on the part of average, ordinary, decent Americans is near a boiling point. Once they hear about this latest allegation! ìThis guy Kavanaugh was running rape trains and women getting drunk?î It doesnít pass any smell test or believability test. The Democrats have just reached the absolute bottom of whatever pit they live in, and hereís the thing.All of this, I firmly believe, has been planned. I think itís a previously conceived plan that they are in the process now of, in their minds, flawlessly executing. I think theyíve got various things waiting for various other stages to happen. And when it looks like all is lost and Kavanaugh is gonna be confirmed, there they go to the dregs of what theyíve got and bring it all out. I havenít heard it yet, but it canít be long now that somebodyís gonna say, ìWell, we canít have this hearing tomorrow. Not with this latest allegation.îOf course, for the Democrats and their thinking, this woman is obviously cannot be challenged. Sheís the accuser. Itís the #MeToo movement, and whatever she says, it has to be accepted because we believe the victims. We think women donít lie in these circumstances, and so there will be a new demand for an FBI investigation and so forth. In the meantime, itís gonna get lost on people that Avenatti is not ó nor his client. They are not suggesting Kavanaugh did anything. At best, this stuff happened and Kavanaugh and his buddy Judge were there and hanging around.But this is the first that anybody has heard of ìrape trains,î the rape drug, and getting girls in high school drunk so as to create ìrape trains.î That just hit this week with Avenatti alluding to the fact that he had a client that was gonna say so. The Kavanaugh lawyer, by the way, Beth WilkinsonÖ The Christine Blasey Ford legal team sent over some documents here that are part of the process., and Kavanaughís lawyer says that they didnít send a light detector test or the therapist notes. Yeah, now imagine that.ìThe attorney for Kavanaugh says that the notes taken during therapy sessions with Kavanaughís accuser as well as results from a lie detector test have not yet been turned over ahead of tomorrowís hearing. Beth Wilkinson was on CBS This Morning today. She said, ëThat information would be very important to corroborate claims that the nominee sexually assaulted Ford in high school. We canít see the lie detector results?'î No. (chuckles) Weíre never gonna see those, folks.ìWilkinson said, ìThey announced that there were notes and that theyíre lie did he talk test but as I understand it they didnít turn any of those over to the Senate committee even though they were requested. So the information that would have shown what she said at the very first time that she revealed these allegations has not been turned over to the Senate! Thereís no way we can corroborate this independently.î But four people have corroborated her story? No, they havenít! Four people have not corroborated her story. They have corroborated that she told them the story after Mitt Romney leaked that he was thinking of naming Kavanaugh to the court if Romney had won in 2012.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The one thing I think is probably safe to say is that the Democrats knew they were losing. Blasey Ford had bombed out. That didnít pan out the way they want, and then the Ramirez stories. They werenít moving the needle because both were designed to make Kavanaugh cave or Trump cave. Make Trump pull the nomination or Kavanaugh to say, ìTo hell with this.î That didnít happen. So I think this is the Hail Mary. Avenatti with this babe and the ìrape trainsî is the Hail Mary, and it remains to be seenÖYou know, people are gonna start saying, ìI donít know how he can continue with all of this hanging over his head. Even if he ends up being exonerated, even if he makes it to the court, for crying out loud, this stuff is never gonna be forgotten.î Theyíre flooding the zone for precisely that reason. They are trying to destroy and sully a reputation for the rest of Kavanaughís life here. Again, decent people (chuckles) donít quite know how to deal with this, much less refute it, other than to say itís bogus.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Iíll tell you something else. Iíll tell you how smooth the operation was to blindside the Republicans today. On Monday we got the story that Avenatti ó the porn star attorney ó had this babe that knew of ìrape trainsî in Kavanaughís high school. Women were drugged and given adult beverages in massive quantities, and this set up ìrape trainsî for guys to go in and out of rooms where these drunk and drugged women had been placed on beds. And then shortly after that there began to be on various odd places on the internet (like Forchan and other places) that Avenatti had all of a sudden locked his Twitter account, that Avenatti was pulling back on it.Everybody said, ìSee? See? He doesnít have anything, he doesnít have diddly-squat. He tried, and he launched a blank,î and then this morning here comes Avenatti. On the eve of Blasey Fordís testimony and Kavanaughís, here comes Avenatti, and heís got a babe, and heís got a picture. Heís got a name. She doesnít name Kavanaugh specifically, but he was in the surrounding vicinity lurking around doing whatever, and she is willing ó 100% willing ó to show up and answer anybodyís questions about it.So the Republicans on the Judiciary CommitteeÖ I donít know who else in the Republican side of things, probably a lot of people ó end up being blindsided today. So blindsided within Iím watching TV during the break and people still talking about this hearing tomorrow, even after theyíve reported the Avenatti today. I should say the Julie Swetnick story. Theyíre still talking about this hearing tomorrow as though nothing has happened. I think people havenít yetÖ It hasnít hit people yet what this is. (chuckles) It will in due course.The name of this game is delay, delay, delay. Make sure there isnít a vote. If they have to destroy Kavanaugh and his family and his career and his reputation and his life? Well, so be it. Thatís what he deserves for being a conservative and trying to get on the court. Thatís what they tried to do to Trump, and theyíre still trying to do to Trump. But Trump fights back on íem every day, keeps pushing íem back and beating íem. Thatís what they try to do to every one of us that attempts to encroach on what they consider theirs by virtue of entitlement.What they consider theirs by virtue of entitlement is a pretty broad swath. Itís power in Washington. They think itís theirs, and anybody seeking to take it is gonna be destroyed under the premise, ìYou are not even valid to be here! You do not have standing to even be among us, much less take our power ó and if you so much as try, weíre gonna show you how little you matter to anybody anywhere.ìIf we have to destroy you and make your little girls cry, if we have to destroy their future and make sure they can never go anywhere without being pointed at by people accusing their dad of being a train-rape setter-upper, then thatís what weíre gonna do,î and thatís what theyíre doing. They are shameless and without conscience. I havenít yet met the decent people who know how to deal with this and to beat it back. The only exception is Donaldus J. Trump, who pushes back in his own way and frustrates them.  "

Ruth Ginsburg, Ruth ìBuzziî Ginsburg, is gonna hang on as long as she can. Her objective is to hang on ítil 2020. Thatís when the Democrats think that Trump will lose reelection. She will retire in 2020 and then the Democrats will say, ìWait a minute here. The Biden Rule! Trump canít nominate her replacement.îI want to makeÖ This is probably foolish, but I have the opportunity here, and Iím gonna give it just a little bit of a shot. Over the years, I have very rarely made personal appeals to elected officials on the belief that it would be unsuccessful, wouldnít work. Itís probably still the case. However, if I had a chance to talk to Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, I would like to say just one thing primarily to them. I just saw a little news report that theyíre both wavering.Murkowskiís under the idea that it really would be great if we could have an FBI investigation. That would answer all the questions. Susan Collins, I donít know what specific thing or things that make it impossible for her to openly say she would support Kavanaugh right now, despite how theyíve treated her. They have disrespected her, they have blackmailed her, theyíve threatened her. They have run a GoFundMe campaign, the left has, on Susan Collins, claiming that theyíre going to fund an opponent of hers to the tune of a million dollars to start until she commits to voting ìnoî on Kavanaugh.She stood her ground.She wouldnít accept that promise.So she started to harass her with cardboard cutouts three feet in length of male genitalia. She openly expressed her disgust for some Democrat tactics and so forth. I know the pressure is on both Senator Murkowski and Senator Collins to look at this as male versus female, and they are being pressured to be loyal to their gender here, and theyíre being pressured to acquiesce to the Democrat-leftist line of thought, which is that a woman must be believed regardless and despite no evidence.A woman must be believed because men just naturally canít be trusted. And if there is even a slithering doubt about this, that Kavanaugh cannot possibly be confirmed. And I would, in probably wasted breath, ask both of them to rise above gender here and look at this in terms of human decency, basic humanity. It cannot have escaped either of you ladies how Judge Kavanaugh and his family have been treated.It canít escape you how he passed every exam before your committee with flying colors. You cannot ignore his overwhelming qualifications, his judicial temperament. You cannot overlook that he has the characteristics that even brilliant leftist lawyers in this process acknowledge, that just in terms of jurisprudence, there isnít anybody more qualified or better to put on the Supreme Court than Brett Kavanaugh, at any time ó not just now, but at any time.I would ask both of you ladies to just step back and take a look at what this process has been and what its objective really is. Itís nothing about Supreme Court, ladies. The left doesnít think that Kavanaugh poses a threat to the court. Kavanaugh posed a threat to them and their use of the court. They use the court as a political backstop for when they lose elections. But in terms of confirming or not confirming a human being whoís qualified, youíre not gonna find anybody better than Judge Kavanaugh.And then take a look at whatís being done to him and his family. Do you want to be a party to that? Do you really want to be a party to aÖ? Itís not just a smear campaign. This is an outright, open, in-front-of-everybody-who-wants-to-see-it-for-what-it-is effort to destroy a fine man and his family, his entire lifeís work and future. Does this accuser have that kind of evidence? Does the accuser have that degree of evidence that is worthy of the full destruction of an American life, an American career and an American family that poses a threat to no one?Does this accuser or do any of the others, do they really haveÖ? Senator Murkowski and Senator Collins, do they really have that kind of evidence? If they do, why are you still struggling with the decision? If you think that what these accusers have is true, then it ought not be even something you have to think about. But the fact that youíre going back and forth on this is quite indicative that you donít think that whatever the accuser has or is saying is sufficient.Weíre not talking about just keeping somebody off the court here. Weíre not talking about just defeating a Donald Trump nominee. Do you want to be party to what the objective here really is? Does Brett Kavanaugh, American citizen ó Brett Kavanaughís wife and kidsÖ? Do they deserve, have they done anything that would warrant the ruination of their entire lives? Itís not correct to say that if this doesnít work out, that Kavanaugh will have something to fall back on.They are trying to take that away too.It appears to me that there isnít any evidence here, that what we have is a last minute, late-breaking allegation with no substance whatsoever and a reluctant witness, a reluctant victim to come forward and make the case that something that happened 35 years ago that cannot be established and cannot be provedÖ Even if, Senator Murkowski, the FBI got involved, there is no way any investigatory agency, investigative agency will be able to determine.But even the worst of her allegations do not warrant what the end result here and what the unabashed effort of the Democrats is. Now, I know Iím probably (chuckles) spitting spitballs here at a battleship. But I couldnít be a party to this, and I think so much of what happens in WashingtonÖ Ari Fleischer was right. Itís a sick town right now. I donít think it actually crosses the minds of people who find themselves in the middle of this, as in senators, whatís really at stake here. And Iím not talking about politics.Weíre talking about a human being, an American citizen of great stature who is being destroyed. Theyíre attempting to literally destroy him, and there doesnít seem to be any concern about that. Nobody seems to have any guilt or conscience about what the end result of this (with no evidence whatsoever) would end up being. Is it that easy in Washington to destroy people? Is it really this easy? This is all it takes?Yeah, I just saw Bill Cosby sentenced three-to-10 years in state prison as a sexually violent predator, $25,000 fine, and he has to pay the cost of prosecuting it. Thereís a lot of evidence there, Senators Murkowski and Collins. There was a lot of evidence there. There isnít a whole lot of doubt about the Bill Cosby cases. But this? Is it this easy to destroy people? I mean, we outside of Washington see this happening so frequently that we wonder.We hear about humanity and tolerance and compassion. We donít see any of it in Washington. Weíre talking about theÖ It seems like itís a one-way street, the destruction of lives here, careers. The destruction of the ability to earn a living. As a human being, you cannot live a life much more devoted than Brett Kavanaugh has, and to see it seemingly so relatively easy to destroy in todayís Washington is really scary. A little bit sobering.You claim to want to see evidence, but there isnít any, and there isnít going to be any. The politics of it? Youíre afraid to reject the allegation of a woman because youíre betraying your gender. I would ask every senator in Washington to rise above this. Weíre not talking about gender and loyalty to genders here. Thatís identity politics. Weíre talking about humanity, a human being here that didnít do anything to anybody, by the way, before this all started.There wasnít one allegation that Brett Kavanaugh had done anything to anybody, harmed anybody. So it just seems to me thatÖ I know youíve got a tough call to make in your world. Youíre women. The pressures here are to be loyal to gender. Of course, there are stories of male abuse and harassment that are true, undeniably so. But just because thereís evidence that it has happened and does happen doesnít make it so in this case.It just seems so obvious that the Democrats are attempting to continue to thwart the will of the American people every day. This nomination is the result of the American people electing Donald Trump. And despite the efforts of some in that town to say that his election was illegitimate because he colluded with RussiaÖ Look at all of the things for which there is no evidence that Washington, D.C., is operating under.The will of the American people is on display and at stake here, and it just seems that it needs to be treated a little bit more seriously than the politics as usual or the politics of the day regarding the #MeToo movement. None of that seems relevant here. I keep hoping every day that Iím gonna wake up and see that Collins and Murkowski have made up their minds that after looking at this and listening to everything, that there just isnít enough here to do what would be the result here, and thatís destroy life and career of somebody.Does anybody deserve that who has not committed a crime? Or has he? Has he committed a crime by being nominated by Donald Trump? Has he committed a crime by being conservative? Has he committed a crime believing in the original intent of the Constitution? Has he committed a crime in his various opinions from the D.C Circuit Court of Appeals? Well, no, he hasnít, unless you allow conservative thought, Republican ideas to be judged as criminal.Please donít participate in that. I realize you have a tough decision in your minds, and I know the immense pressure you both are under. But having a sense of decency toward humanity and being unwilling to participate in what is so obviously an effort to destroy ó not just prevent a confirmation, but to destroy ó a human being with innuendo and no evidence. It canít be easy to be part of that. I hope it isnít.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: San Antonio. This is Patty. Is that right? Yeah, hi, Patty. Welcome.CALLER: Hi. How are you? Itís great to talk to you.RUSH: Good. Good, good, good. Thank you.CALLER: Great. My thought is that when the day is done, this might actually end up being a good thing in the long run. I mean, itís horrible now. But weíve seen that phenomenon where so many Supreme Court justices have been conservative prior to their appointment to the court and then once they get into Washington and get into that Washington bubble, they start going to the middle or even to the left. My thought is that if Kavanaugh does get confirmed, he will know, without a doubt, who they are. I donít think heíll ever trust them again, and I think in a way that would almost ensure that he continues to, you know óRUSH: So you donít think that theyíll be able to buy him off on a case-by-case basis with puff pieces in the Washington Post Style section?CALLER: Exactly.RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: I think he would be like Justice Thomas, who has been just stellar, who has just been, you know, completely right on.RUSH: Boy, are you right about that. Clarence Thomas? What a godsend for the court and for America Clarence Thomas has been. Not just has been, but is. His legal mind and his brilliance are on display with every opinion he writes or concurs with or dissents from. Heís a genuine treasure, and youíre right about Kavanaugh. I donít think it was ever a problem with him anyway, though, to tell you the truth.  "

You predicted another woman would come forward. How did you know? How did you know?î Well, letís go back to the audio sound bites. This is last Thursday, me on my programÖBEGIN RUSH ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Iím telling you right now itís already in the works with, and I know itís in the works because I heard a Drive-By Media person talking about it. The Drive-By Media person was Karen Tumulty of the Washington Post who says she wouldnít be surprised if more women surface over the weekend alleging similar acts by Kavanaugh. Sheís just telegraphed that theyíre out there trying to find women that they can convince to come forward and say what they want them to say. You know theyíre working on that.You know that the Democrat Party, you know that the media ó theyíre working in tandem ó are scouring women who went to the same school or went to school where Kavanaugh was seen, you know, lurking around and so forth. And theyíre gonna try to find as many women ó not too many, find one or two women ó to come forward and say, ìYeah, I didnít want to come forward but Iím watching whatís happening to Christine Blasey Ford, and I canít stand it.î So donít be surprised.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Well, and itís happened. No great shakes here. Predicting this wasÖ If you know the left, as I do, it was simple. Iíll even buttress it further. Ronan Farrow: ìNew Kavanaugh Accuser Came Forward Because Democrats Came Looking.î What did I say here? You know the Democrats, the media, theyíre working in tandem scouring women who went to the same school or went to school where Kavanaugh was seen. Farrow confirms even that. ìThe accuser came forward because the Democrats came looking,î and they didnít have to look hard.This woman was a recipient of George Soros funds. Every one of these people, one way or the other, is connected to Hillary Clinton or her campaign. Every one of them! All of this is ultimately going to be traceable back to Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. You mark my words. Here is Karen Tumulty, just to show you that this is whatÖ I didnít need this. I didnít even need this to tell me that it was gonna be another woman show up before today. But this is Karen Tumulty last Wednesday night on the All-Star Panel of Special Report Bret Baier.TUMULTY: The thing I think we all need to remember is that we still have 4-1/2 days until Monday. And weíreÖ The way the news cycle works in these times, this ó this whole thing is probably gonna take five or six twists and turns.BREAM: Right.TUMULTY: Now, maybe other people coming out of the woodwork either to verify what Judge Kavanaugh is saying or to back up when she is saying. By Monday, this could look like a very different situation.RUSH: Bingo! And here we are at Monday, and it looks like a completely different situation. They went out and they found this woman. This womanís story has so many holes in it, the New York Times will not run it. This story has twelve holes in it that people now have spotted in analysis. Thereís nothing to it, but the left doesnít care. This is my point from the opening hour. Theyíve got nothing to lose with this depravity. Theyíve got nothing to lose by taking every bit of American culture they can into the gutter.Their base will applaud them. Their base will reward them for this. There is nothing for them to lose. There is no shame directed at them for what theyíre doing. Interestingly enough, if they werenít trying to get rid of Kavanaugh, their base would be pummeling them to death. Their base is demanding this. Not to say the Democrats wouldnít be doing it on their own anyway. But my point is that it wasnít that long ago that this kind of thing in American politics would doom the party trying it.And if the Republicans tried it today it would doom them because the media would turn on them and accuse them of upsetting the Constitution and jurisprudence and ages and ages of case law. Theyíve got nothing to lose here. They donít control the Senate now. They donít control the House. Theyíve got literally nothing to lose. The way of looking at it is thereís thereís no ìtoo lowî they can go ó and in the process, theyíre taking the country right with them, particularly when theyíre walking politics. David ìRodhamî Gergen on CNN last night with the anchor Ana Cabrera. Question: ìIs it fair to have any timeline at this point for getting through any potential investigation and putting Kavanaugh up for a vote?îGERGEN: There has to be a couple days where not only the senators and the White House, but the public can absorb this and begin to make judgments. You know, we need to be a little patient with this process playing out so thatÖ Again, I canít tell you how important I think it is to the future of the press in this country that if he is going to be brought down, that the press is not seen as complicit in that effort.CABRERA: Yeah.RUSH: Well, now, if youíre even thinking about that, then it must be itís already hit you that you are complicit. I mean, what a statement. Stop and think of this. David ìRodhamî Gergen ó who has worked for every president you can think of ó says, ìI canít tell you how important I think it is to the future of the press in this country that if he is going to be brought down, that the press is not seen as complicit in that effort.î (chuckles) A little too late for that, donít you think, Mr. Gergen?The press cannot be seen as complicit? They know ó at least Gergen does. They know that theyíre damping their reputations. See, the press has a lot to lose. The press has market share, subscriptions, advertising rates, jobs. The press has a lot to lose here. The Democrat Party not so much. The Democrat Partyís deranged base, though, does not spend money subscribing to the New York Times or the Washington Post in great numbers. The Democrat Party base show up and vote, but theyíve got nothing to lose with this depravity. But the press does, and Mr. Gergen knows it.Hereís Jane Mayer, who co-wrote the story in the New Yorker with Ronan Farrow. Sheís on the Today show today with the cohost Savannah Guthrie. The question, ìYour reporting makes clear that Deborah Ramirez was candid about questions about her own memory,î meaning she doesnít remember much, and she admits that she wasnít sober for much of this party, ìobviously her sobriety at this college party. The White House has zeroed in on a New York Times story, saying they canít confirm any of this. ìIt seems like the New Yorker didnít find anyone with firsthand knowledge, either. Is there corroboration?îSo here you have a media person telling another media person who wrote the story, ìHey, nobody can corroborate what you wrote. Is there any?î and hereís the answer.MAYER: Donít have to read tea leaves. Weíre right out front about it, and theyíre saying, ìWe found no eyewitnesses who would confirm it.î Um, we, uh, found somebody who remembers hearing about it at night or the next day. Um óRUSH: Okay, stop it. Thatís all IÖ Stop the tape. Why did the story run, then? If one of the authors says, ìWeíre right out front about it saying we found no eyewitnesses who could confirm it,î then why did it run? Well, we all know the answer to that. It ran to provide cover for Democrat senators to cancel the hearing on Thursday. Now itís gotten too murky, too messy, too dangerous for poor Dr. Ford! She canít be expected to show up now in this circus.Sheís not gonna testify Thursday. Make book on it, folks; it isnít gonna happen. This story also gives Democrat senators the excuse to claim, ìAll right. This is it. Weíve got another allegation ó and since women donít lie, and since conservatives have no presumption of innocence, heís guilty. He needs to withdraw! Trump needs to withdraw the nomination.î Thatís what the purpose of this story is. No eyewitnesses ó and thatís just the tip of the iceberg about things wrong with this story. No eyewitnesses, and yet it ran. Why?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Anita Hill didnít have any eyewitnesses, either, ladies and gentlemen, even though she claimed Thomas said the pubic hair on the Coke can and the Long Dong Silver stuff in front of the entire committee. Even though there was no evidence and no eyewitnesses, she still laid it all out for the committee. So the point is the woman doesnít need evidence. Thatís whatís being done to the rule of law by these people. They donít need any evidence. The DemocratsÖ There will be a new video from Hollywood actresses.ìWe believe Ramirez! We believe Ramirez! Sheís telling the truth,î even though the New York Times and New Yorker say they couldnít find a single witness. See, it doesnít matter. The nature of the evidence? No biggie. Seriousness of the charge? Everything. All this is to provide cover for Democrats and the media to demand Kavanaugh just quit and go kill himself. Thatíd be the best. ìJust get out of here. Just leave us alone. You have no business being on the Supreme Court and youíre not gonna be as long as we have anything to do with it.îThatís their attitude.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/24/democrats-destroy-the-rule-of-law-and-american-jurisprudence/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 24, 2018RUSH: Well, my friends, I kind of told you this last Thursday that there was gonna be another woman come forward, and I did not think it would be to buttress whatís-her-faceís story, that it would have to be a new incident. And, lo and behold! Now, a 5-year-old could have made this prediction. But I did it, and it has come to pass, and itís gotten even worse. Folks, this week has the potential to be brutal, because this week has the potential to prove beyond doubt that the Democrat Party, the left, and the American media are bankrupt.They are bankrupt of everything good, they are bankrupt of everything decent ó and, in the process, folks, they are doing such damage to America. I want to elaborate on this a bit. They are doing such damage to the Constitution, but it is America, it is our country that is being damaged here in ways that I donít think itís out of line to say few people ever thought would actually happen internally.We are about to witness behavior that should shock everyone. I think that the true face ó if it hasnít been already ó of the radical left is about to be revealed in Technicolor. Now, I think it already has been, but itís obvious that not everybody sees the radical left for who it is, what it is, and who they are. It is ugly, and it is typified by Michael Avenatti. He is the lawyer for Stormy Daniels, and, out of the blue last night, he starts a Twitter storm claiming to represent a woman with ìcredible informationî regarding Judge Kavanaugh and this guy Mark Judge.He claims that Kavanaugh and Mark JudgeÖ Are you ready for this? He claims that Kavanaugh and Mark Judge routinely ó at parties in high school and college ó got women drunk and gave them pills so as to start a ìrape train.î He is demanding the opportunity to present testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee and will be demanding that Mark Judge and others be subpoenaed to testify to this and then demands that the nomination must be withdrawn. What is happening here right in front of our faces is the destruction of America.By that Iím talking about primarily the education system I think is where it starts. The greatest evidence for this ó and, folks, I have to tell you, Iíve got butterflies here. Call it nervousness; itís not nervousness. Itís not performance pressure. Itís not that Iím nervous over what Iím saying. Itís that itís happening. That this is happening has my gut in knots. It literally does. It has my stomach in knots. My heart rate is elevated. I happen to know that because I wear an Apple Watch which calculates it, and I am in touch with my heart rate on a momentís notice.And itís elevated right now. Itís in rhythm; donít worry. But itís elevated. One of the bedrock principles of America, one of the many things enshrined in our Constitution that sets America apart from everywhere else is in our law, in our jurisprudence, in the rule of law the concept that anybody charged with anything is innocent until proved guilty. Now, I know itís been bastardized and I know at times itís been stood upside down on its head in court as lawyers engage in tricks with juries and so forth. Thatís one thing.This is an institutional assault that is taking place, and the Democrat Party is literally in charge of this. Essentially, whenever politics is involved ó and theyíve politicized everything. Whenever politics is involved, the accused is automatically guilty and must prove his or her innocence. The accuser is automatically believed ó unquestionably, automatically believed. This stands the rule of law on its head, and the reason is itís impossible to prove a negative. Itís impossible to prove you didnít do it, particularly in courts of law. If youíre innocent, itís very difficult to prove a negative.Ask Kavanaugh how thatís going. But to turn this upside down, as they are doing, what it is essentially is saying is, ìIf you are conservative, you are guilty if we accuse you.î The starting point is such that itís not even worth your time to defend yourself because it doesnít matter. ìWe say you did it. We say youíre guilty. We say youíre a rapist. We say you are a serial abuser. We say that you got women drunk and gave them pills to begin rape trains at parties. Youíre guilty, and you have to go! You must leave.ìYou must withdraw. Your supporters must withdraw their nomination of you.î This is the destruction of our rule of law and the American jurisprudent system on steroids. The thing about all of this, folks, is the leftÖ This is the real depressing part of this, to me. Theyíve got nothing to lose with this behavior. They have nothing to lose with this politics and everything to gain by it. And what does that say about our country and where it is? Their lunatic, deranged base is applauding this.In fact, I would go so far as to say their lunatic base may be driving this. Their base voters, the people they are counting on to win the House and the Senate are applauding this. They are applauding the turning upside down of the rule of law. They are applauding the literal destruction of innocent lives and great reputations. They are applauding it, and they are demanding it. And the Democrats who participate in it will be rewarded for doing so, and there will be no penalty to them. In their minds, all of America agrees with them ó well, a majority.This is another sick thing.In their minds ó these Democrats in the Senate, Democrats everywhere ó they think that a majority of Americans agrees with them and now accepts that Kavanaugh is a reprobate. Even though the evidence from either Blasey Ford or this other woman, whatever her name is. (interruption) Ramirez, yeah. Even though none of it can be proven, none of it can be established ó and everybody claimed to be a witness says they werenít there. In both instances, the Democrats still believe a majority of Americans agree with them and support this because they believe a majority of Americans want no conservatives anywhere near any elected position or appointed position of power.I believe that this is a ramification of the fact that America, the United States of America as an entity, as a country ó our Constitution, our founding documents, the greatness, the uniqueness, the specialness, the exceptionalism of America ó is not taught, starting in kindergarten, and hasnít been taught for a couple of generations. Instead, America is bashed all over education. America is criticized as unjust, unfair, racist/slave. It is portrayed as anti-woman, anti-gay, anti-minority. It is portrayed as a nation founded by and established for white men who discriminate and mistreat everybody else.Itís been that way for 250 years, and itís time to overthrow it ó and thatís what weíre witnessing. And for two generations, theyíve been educating people toward this, that America is at fault. So many of the bedrock principles that distinguish America are going. Some of them are gone already. Among the biggest, as I mentioned, is that the accused now has to prove innocence when politics is involved.And since they are politicizing everything, it means all they have to do is level an allegation, and here come their buddies in the media treating it as though it is gospel, treating it as though it is irrefutable, treating it as though it cannot be denied, it cannot be questioned. It must be accepted, and you must love the accuser to boot. So now the accused ó every accused conservative ó must establish innocence. They donít have to prove anything. Their allegation alone is enough to get rid of anybody, and their base voters demand it! Their base voters applaud it.This is the results of this new shift away from the accuser has to prove guilt, and we saw it when Blasey Fordís lawyer says, ìShe doesnít have to corroborate anything! She doesnít have to prove anything. Itís up to Kavanaugh to prove that he didnít do it.î Again, when Harry Reid accused Mitt Romney of not paying his taxes, Harry Reid said, ìA friend of mine told me that Romney hadnít paid taxes in 10 years.î The press said, ìWhatís your evidence?î and Reid got mad at íem. ìWhat do you mean, whatís my evidence? You need to go ask Romney why he hasnít paid his taxes in 10 years!îOff they were to ask Mitt Romney why he hadnít paid his taxes in 10 years. Shortly after they had just finished asking Romney if he believed states should have the right to ban contraception, when such a thing had never been brought up. Nobody believes that, supports that, but they made sure that everybody thought Romney wanted that. Itís so distorted. They have so distorted American education. To young people, you know what American justice is? To young people, the American system of justice is destroying conservatives ó however, whenever.Thatís what legions of young people have been taught that justice is. Theyíve been taught in high school. Theyíve been taught in middle school. Theyíve probably been conditioned to believe such things as early as kindergarten. Certainly when they get to what are called institutions of higher learning, academe. This is what theyíve been taught justice is. So now weíve got another accuser, as predicted. And right on cue, as soon as this second accuserÖBy the way, Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer are behind this story. Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer at The New Yorker. Somebody asked Ronan Farrow (paraphrased exchange), ìHow did you hear about this woman?î and he said, ìOh, the Democrat Party has been looking for her.î He admitted, ìThe Democrat Party has been trying to find them, and the Democrat Party found this woman who called me. Theyíve been looking for them.î Well, this was also as predictable as the sun coming up in the morning.Now all kinds of senators are demanding that Kavanaugh withdraw. Theyíre demanding that Trump withdraw the nomination. Theyíre demanding Kavanaugh quit. ìHe canít go forward. He will forever be sullied. There will forever be a cloud. It just would make more sense if Kavanaugh just quit.î Senator Feinstein (whoís behind all of this), Senator Gillibrand, Senator Jeff Merkley (Democrat-Oregon), Senator Claire McCaskill (Democrat-Missouri).They believe that there are legions of independent voters that just canít wait to show up at the polls in November and vote Democrat because Americans are tired of sexual predators like Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh being appointed to the Supreme Court because predators like these donít care about womenís rights, especially abortion. And so theyíve gotta go. Theyíre even saying that if Kavanaugh somehow gets on the court and they win the House and the Senate, theyíre gonna investigate him and theyíre gonna impeach him.Now you add Avenatti to this. Weíll have details of all these new charges as the program unfolds, but I wanted to set the table and establish the umbrella under which everything is happening today. Now with this Avenatti guy, Stormy Danielsí lawyer calling the Senate Judiciary Committee staff. He sent íem an email demanding to be heard. He represents a woman. Not Ramirez and not Blasey Ford.Heís got another woman with ìcredible informationî regarding Kavanaugh and Mark Judge, that they were getting women drunk and plying them with pills at parties in order to start ìrape trainsî for the guys at these parties. Iíll make you another prediction. Christine Ford, Dr. Ford, will not testify Thursday. That is the latest. Sheís scheduled to. Youíve seen that. Itís not gonna happen. Sheís not gonna testify, and you can tell right off the bat why. With these new allegations, she can easily say, ìThis has become a circus. I donít feel safe. I donít feel secure.ìI ó I ó I donít think itís wise. I ó I ó I donít think itís wise.î Her lawyer will say all this probably sometime on Wednesday.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So I checked the email during the break and somebody said, ìBut, Mr. Limbaugh, donít Democrats have sons? Are they not worried about what theyíre doing to their own sons by running around trashing every conservative white male they can find?î Yeah, they have sons. But what are theyÖ? (chuckles) What are they creating with their sons? They also have daughters, you see? And theyíre conditioning their daughters to believe that normal, male behavior is abuse and harassed.Iím not denying abuse and harassment happens, and Iíd probably say that it happens more often than you and I would think in circumstances like parties and high school, college, this kind of thing, things that women think areÖ But what the Democrats are doing are trying to condition women to believe that just traditional male behavior and abuse and harassment, and if youíre a guy running around thinking thatís what you are, what, then, will become of your behavior? You wuss out.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Somebody asked me in an email, ìRush, it sounds like you donít believe the second and third accusers here.î Really? What was your first clue? This is a charade here. Itís an absolutely charade. It was a predictable charade. It was predictable last Thursday that there was gonna be another woman coming forward, particularly after a Washington Post reporter pretty much let it be known, Karen Tumulty. This was not a tough prediction.Now, this next accuser, Debbie Ramirez? Her story doesnít hold water. In fact, the New York TimesÖ Are you ready for this? The New York Times doesnít even want to run this story because they think it is so lacking. There isnít any confirmation, thereís no corroboration, and even Ronan Farrow said that the reason the woman came forward is because the Democrats went out and tried looking for these women, tried to find these women. Debbie Ramirez isÖ By the way, Debbie Ramirezís story involvesÖLook what theyíre doing to this program. Look whatÖ A dildo. It involves a dildo. Brett Kavanaugh was using a dildo in peopleís faces according to this story. Decent people have really no idea how to deal with this. Decent people donít sit around strategizing how to deal with this kind of depravity. Maybe we should, but people donít. Depravity and this kind of thing is just second nature to the Democrats and their base.Anyway, Debbie Ramirezís lawyer is ó are you ready for it? ó dadelut dadelut dadelut dadelut ó ìa major Democrat donor and activists who has given thousands of dollars to Hillary Clinton as well as donations to Democrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing the Kavanaugh case.î There are Democrat donors ó there are Democrat activists ó at every level of these allegations against Brett Kavanaugh. So now we have Kavanaugh, who, by the way, has undergone, has underwent six FBI background checks.Six of them! So let me ask a question: Six FBI background checks. How does the FBI not find somebody who lived very close to you for every address you had in your life? How does the FBI not find the dildo and the rape train stories and the women who claim that Kavanaugh and his friend drugged them and got them drunk and set these trains up? How does the FBI miss every aspect of this story? How do they miss the Christine Blasey Ford story in six FBI background checks?Have you ever undergone an FBI background check, or have you ever had the FBI come to you as somebody who knows somebody whoís under investigation? Have you ever had the FBI question you? They are very thorough. Do not doubt me. Yet the FBI turned up nothing, and so what are we hearing from these latest jack-in-the-box pop-ups? Demands for an FBI investigation. Of course when the whole idea of that is pooh-poohed, then they say, ìSee? They know heís guilty, and they donít want the FBI to find it. He needs to withdraw, and Trump needs to withdraw the nomination.îItís how this all works.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Do you remember the Rolling Stone story? They were nearly sued out of business on all the false rape stories that had occurred at that university? You remember that? A woman wrote that story. She made it up, and she admitted she made it up because itís a serious thing, rape on campus. Even though she had no evidence of it, people needed to know how bad it was. So she made it all up, wrote stories about it. Rolling Stone ran it anyway, defended if after the fact. Now they were programming sued out of exist.Well, this New Yorker story is being reacted to even by the left in much the same way. The New York Times canít confirm any of it and theyíre beginning to ask, ìWhy did it run?î (chuckles) Why did it run? Ronan Farrow says in answer to the question that the new Kavanaugh accuser came forward because Democrats came looking. Meaning, Democrats came to me wanting to know if there are any women. They came looking for women. They were putting out feelers for women to come forward. The story cannot be confirmed.None of the witnesses can be confirmed as having known or been anywhere near when this dildo was supposedly rubbed in peopleís faces, and yet the story runs. There are holes throughout this story. The New Yorker could not find a single witness who put Kavanaugh at this alleged party. The New York Times could not find a single person who could corroborate Ramirezís claims. In fact, Ross Douthat (who is a columnist at the New York Times) has tweeted, ìSeems odd that neither the New Yorker nor my newspaper [the New York Times] could get any of these YaliesÖîThis all happened at Yale. They couldnít get ìany of these Yalieís to confirm the story.î Why is that odd? Why is it odd that neither the New Yorker nor the New York Times could find any confirmation? Maybe itís odd to him because he canít believe the story ran. If there arenít any corroborating witnesses, if thereís no corroboration whatsoever why run it? Maybe thatís whatís odd about it. ìit seems odd that neither the New Yorker nor my newspaper, the New York Times, could get rid of these Yalies to confirm their storyî?Well, only if you think itís an abomination the story ran despite that. ìA third person that Ramirez claimed was at the party says she was not there for the alleged incident. Ramirez contacted her former classmates asking about the incident, admitted she was not sure that Kavanaugh was the guy who exposed himself. A woman who claimed she was best friends with Ramirez says Ramirez never mentioned this story and initially said that her friendís accusations against Kavanaugh might be politically motivated.îThereís nothing to it! But yet here are the Democrats demanding Kavanaugh resign because, in their new world, heís guilty. She cannot be making it up! She does not have to prove it. Simply the fact sheís alleged it about a conservative is all we need to get rid of the conservative. He cannot defend himself. He shouldnít even be allowed to defend himself. Itís same thing with Blasey Ford.  "

The New York Times is claiming that Christine Blasey Ford says that she would ìtestify next week if the terms are fair and her safety is assured.î CNN has now picked up that breaking news. They are trumpeting it loudly. She has said, according to the New York Times, that she will show up and ìtestify next week if the terms are fair and her safety is assured.î Now, what ìtermsî could she be talking about? Witnesses? If so, that could delay things right there, since it will take time to get them to D.C.So now we gotta have a negotiation on terms and then we gotta have terms that she is going to decide whether or not are fair. Whatever terms are offered, all she has to say is, ìI ó I donít think so. I donít feel safe. For my safety, no. I donít feel secure. I donít feel safe the way youíre setting this up,î and thatís it. The media will report, ìRepublicans Attempt to Sabotage Willing Witness in Effort to Destroy Judge Kavanaugh and Save the Supreme Court.îYou knew, folks, you knew they had something up their sleeves. You heard the last caller said that sheíd make a triumphant entrance on Monday. Now she has said sheíll show up ìif the terms are fair.î Whatís fair? Who gets to define that? What if her terms are outrageously impossible to meet?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, as far as the accuser, she wants ìfairness.î You know, is anybody concerned about the fairness to Brett Kavanaugh in all this? You know, all of a sudden now the accuser is the focal point of everything here, and nobody seems to be concerned about whether Kavanaugh is being treated fairly in any of this, and that needs to be an element of this as well.

What is happening with the Judiciary Committee is really I would call it a railroad job, and itís totally unfair. Iím counting on the members of the press to point out that this is a fast track. They are totally intent on getting Judge Kavanaugh onto the Supreme Court come hell or high water, come hell or high water, and you have to ask yourself, ìWhy?îRUSH: No, we donít. The answer to ìWhy?î is eminently simple. He was nominated. This has gone on weeks longer than the average confirmation process. Heís eminently qualified. The story is why you people are trying to derail him. Anyway, hereís Sean in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Glad you waited, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Thanks for taking my call.RUSH: You bet.CALLER: We know Trump very aggressively goes after people that are attacking him, and he succeeds. Youíve identified all the occasions. This is really an attack on his selection. I think he needs to get out in front, make a statement that says Kavanaugh is preeminently the most qualified candidate for this position, but weíve got people on deck like Amy Coney Barrett and others and get them thinking of the future. Theyíre doing this for the future. Well, thatís his next pick, given the chance. I think he need to go get out in front of this abortion aspect of this with some subtle tweets or jabs, because I think it would refocus peopleís attention on what theyíre really trying to do.RUSH: Well, maybe. But they would relish the chance to destroy her. If they take out Kavanaugh, theyíre gonna be so energized, theyíre gonna beg for him to send up Amy Coney Barrett. They canít wait to destroy her. Donít forget, she was the nominee that they were going back and forth, Kavanaugh or Barrett, who should go first. And they decided to go Kavanaugh first because BarrettÖ See, the original thinking was the Democrats couldnít go after a woman in the #MeToo movement.But then they quickly properly figured out, went back and looked at Dianne Feinstein interviewing her confirmation hearings for her current judgeship and Feinstein said (summarized), ìBoy, the dogma, the Catholic dogma is very loud in you. The Catholic dogma sings very loudly within you.î What that meant, boy, youíre really a devout Catholic. I mean, that governs who you are. You really are anti-choice. Thatís not what she said. Thatís what she meant.And so they decided to wait for Amy Coney Barrett for the next vacancy, thinking itís gonna be Ginsburg just by simple age. Nobody knows, of course. But if they take out Kavanaugh, theyíre gonna welcome Trump sending somebody else they can take out, because if they succeed, theyíre gonna be so armed and ready that they can destroy anybody. So, that kind of thing is one of those be careful for what you wish for. Trump I think is handling this just the right way. Heís making it look like he canít wait for her to show up.He thinks itíd would be wonderful for her to testify. He really wants to hear what she has to say. I mean, heís out there saying why would I doubt the accuser? Why are you so surprised? I want to hear what she has to say. Heís gone on to say that if what she says, and if she is credible, then they might have to look at the nomination of Kavanaugh. This is why CNN ran the story that Trumpís employees, his aides are shocked and stunned. They canít believe that Trumpís not out there destroying her on Twitter and stuff.  "

And this has been a months-long project, this latest reveal, and itís been totally covered up by the Blasey story, the Kavanaugh story; so I want to spend just a few moments, ícause OíKeefe and Project Veritas, they really need encouragement and a bunch of attaboys because thereís nobody else doing what they do.And itís, as such, irreplaceable. I want to recognize them for all of the hard work theyíre doing. Itís pretty risky. In fact, what it is is 60 Minutes kind of journalism but aimed at the left. You know, 60 Minutes with their hidden cameras and this kind of stuff from decades ago trying to expose fraud wherever they found it. None of that ever happens aimed at Democrats or the left and so OíKeefe and his group have exposed ACORN, blew ACORN up, the Obama community organizing groupBREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: To the Project Veritas videos.

This is OíKeefe at work inside the Trump administration. Now, in this hidden camera clip, we have a Government Accountability Office auditor, Natarajan Subramanian, describes how he slows down the Trump agenda from the inside.

Great to have you on the EIB Network. How areÖ Debbie in Dallas, we actually have one here.CALLER: Hi. How are you, Rush?RUSH: Well, just fine, Debbie. Debbieís one of my top 10 all-time favorite female names, by the way.CALLER: Oh. Fabulous! So, Iím wondering if the reason that Ms. Blasey passed her lie detector test is because she actually had that exact situation happen to her but perhaps not with Kavanaugh?RUSH: Itís quite possible. Did you hear me earlier reference the fact that the high school yearbook for this particular year in question has been scrubbed from the internet? Did you hear me mention this?CALLER: Yes, I did.RUSH: Okay. Well, itís been scrubbed because it is replete with the girls in the class writing about stories of all the keg parties they had and the fun times they had when their parents werenít around.

But you donít think that sheís honestly disremembering this; you think she knows it wasnít Kavanaugh but somebodyís convinced her to try to sell that it was Kavanaugh?CALLER: That is correct.RUSH: Okay. Debbie in Dallas, I appreciate your call. I have titillated you enough with this yearbook story, so let me share the details of it with you when we get back right back here.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Two things before I get to the yearbook story. First one here: ìKavanaugh Accuserís Classmate Makes New Claim and Then Backtracks and Deletes Everything.î Thereís a lot of deleting going on out there. The New York Times had to issue a major, major correction. Do you know what they did? The New York Times ran a story about this guy Mark Judge (I think itís his first name), Kavanaughís friend, who doesnít remember a thing about this incident. It was claimed that he was there and so forth.The New York Times ran a story in which they said that this guy ó this friend of Kavanaughís, the judge ó remembers the incident! It was on their website for 40 minutes! ìJudge,î da-da-da-da-da, comma, ìwho does remember the incident, says heÖî He does not! They left out the word ìnotî! It was up on their website for 40 minutes ó an abject lie ó until they corrected it. Their correction alluded to the fact (paraphrased), ìWell, you know, thereís a lot of people out there promulgating fake news. Sometimes even we get caught.îThey didnít get caught with anything. They knowingly tried to get away with it. Thatís why the media has become the chief strategists of the Democrat Party, and itís been that way for a long time. They are the power makers and breakers, and theyíre the ones that are leading the charge. That wasnít a mistake! They put it up there for as long as they could get away with it because they know in 40 minutes or 30 minutes a lot of people are gonna see it and will never see the correction.The New York Times story made it look like that Kavanaughís friend is lying because he told them that he does remember the incident, when he has always said he does not, that he does not remember where it was, when it was. He doesnít remember being in the room when anything like this happened. But the New York Times ran a story that he does, on their website, for 40 minutes. Now, hereís the other. ìA woman who claims to have been classmates in high school with Brett Kavanaughís accuser wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday that the ìincident did happenî and it was talked about at the school for several days after it allegedly happened.ìThe story quickly went viral after NBC News published a report on the claim from Cristina King Miranda ó who lives in MexicoÖî Cristina King Miranda writes ìthat the ëincident did happení and it was talked about at the school for several days after it allegedly happened.î NBCís headline was: ìAccuserís Schoolmate Says She Recalls Hearing of Alleged Kavanaugh Incident.î Well, that Facebook post has been deleted. Hereís what it said:ìëChristine Blasey Ford was a year or so behind me, I did not know her personally but I remember her. This incident did happen. Many of us heard a buzz about it indirectly with few specific details. However[,] Christineís vivid recollection should be more than enough for us to truly, deeply know that the accusation is true. If Kavanaugh truly has the integrity mentioned by those who support him, then he should be just as courageous as Christine and stop trying to dodge the accusations, admit his actions from so long ago, speak from the heart, and apologize.íìHowever, by the time NBC News published its report, King had already appeared to start walking her claim back, writing in a now-deleted Facebook post: ëTo all media, I will not be doing anymore interviews. No more circus for me. To clarify my post: I do not have first hand knowledge of the incident that Dr. Christine Blasey Ford mentions, and I stand by my support for Christine. Thatís it. I donít have more to say on the subject. Please donít contact me further.'îSo she writes: Oh, yeah! Everybody remembers this! People were talking about it. So the media says, ìOh, wow! We gotta track her down.î They track her down; she said, ìI donít want any part of this,î and starts deleting everything. Hereís the yearbook story. Now, the website where this first appearsÖ Let me say up front here that I pass this on to you with some guarded knowledge. Whenever I have not heard of a website, itís dicey, itís tricky. But other people have cited this now and on their websites are publishing parts of it. So it may pass the test.The website is Cultofthe1rst.blogspot.com, and the headline: ìWhy Christine Blasey Fordís High School Yearbooks Were Scrubbed: Faculty Approved Racism, Binge Drinking and Promiscuity.î Now her yearbook has disappeared. Whoever had the power to do it has taken it down, and the person who wrote this story at this website saw this yearbook and writes that he was convinced that it was gonna be taken down. So he cached a bunch of pages and made copies and has it and is now running a story even though the yearbook has been taken offline.That has to mean something. I donít know what the website is ó and, shockingly, the Drive-By Media has ignored this. But here we go: ìOn Monday Sept. 17th, Christine Blasey Fordís high school yearbooks suddenly disappeared from the web. I read them days before, knew they would be scrubbed, and saved them. Why did I know they would be scrubbed? Because if roles were reversed, and Christine Blasey Ford had been nominated for the Supreme Court by President Trump, the headline by the resistance would be this:ìëChristine Blasey Ford and the drunken white privileged racist playgirls of Holton-Arms.'î Thatís the school. The yearbook portrays story after story after story of these girls laughing and joking about their beer parties, keg taps, partying while the parents are gone, whole entries in the yearbook while the parents were away, and then detailed subscriptions of the parties. This guy says, ìAnd it would be an accurate headline. Thatís why the yearbooks have been scrubbed.ìThey are a testament to the incredible power these girls had over their teachers, parents and the boys of Georgetown Prep, Landon and other schools in the area. In the pages below, you will see multiple photos and references to binge drinking and the accompanying joy of not being able to remember any of it. These yearbooks are, therefore, relevant to the national investigation now being conducted in the media, in homes, and in the halls of Congress. And they should not have been scrubbed.ìIf Brett Kavanaughís yearbooks are fair game, so are these. And you will wonder while reading them, why the hell did the faculty approve of these yearbooks? Why did the parents take out paid ads in these yearbooks? Animal House had nothing on the infamous ëHolton party scene.í The resistance media has been singularly focused on Brett Kavanaughís high school yearbooks, which imply that he got drunk and threw up. Thereís no need to imply anything from the Holton-Arms yearbooks.ìItís all there in focus, and the written word too. All of the sordid details as approved for publication by a ëlook the other wayí faculty. And now itís available for historical/evidentiary review. It is to this wild Holton culture we must look in order to shed light on the last minute accusation by Christine Blasey. And in the official high school chronicles of this era, we find many names of people who can provide relevant evidence. Christine ëChrissyí Blasey alleges she cannot recall the exact date, place or names of people who were at the party in question.ìThis research is intended to refresh her recollection and the recollections of others who may recall key facts. (In this report, last names have been redacted and faces obscured, other than the picture of Chrissy Blasey seen below.) The yearbook title is SCRIBE. The relevant issues are SCRIBE í82, SCRIBE í83 and SCRIBE í84, corresponding to Blaseysís sophomore, junior and senior years, when she and her classmates Ö were 15-17 year old juveniles.î Anyway, it goes on. There are pictures of the students while participating in beer parties, drinking parties ó looking disheveled, looking drunk, happy ó describing what it was like to be able to party when the parents were not around.Hereís one: ìWhile the parents were out,î and itís an annual screenshot of what looks like a school newspaper story. It seems to indicate that these parties were frequent and all that. So this is out there. It will be totally ignored by the mainstream and Drive-By Media. But it does dovetail. You know, Debbie in Dallas called and said, ìI think it happened. I think this all happened. I think she just may not remember with whom it happened. And this yearbook and the fact that itís been scrubbed, all three of them, í82, í83, í84, do you cause you to raise eyebrows. ìWhy scrub the yearbooks?î(interruption)Were high schools partying like this in Cape Girardeau when I was coming up? Well, yeah, I mean, there wereÖ It was a big deal to get a six-pack when you were in high school. I, of course, wasnít. I started work when I was 16. But, yeah. It was a big deal. The difference is, none of those parties made the yearbook. (chuckling) You know, we didnít take pictures and publish stories about the grand parties. We did not make public all the great things we did at our parentsí homes when they were away ó which apparently is all over these yearbooks.(interruption)Well, I donít think thatís different from any high school at any other time. Teenagers are always gonna flit around, play around, try to partake of things denied them because of age or what have you. Thereís nothing abnormal about that.(interruption)So what? Whatís the point? (interruption)Mmm-hmm.(interruption)Go ahead. Just ask it.(interruption)ìWhat were the boys likeÖ?î What do youÖ? In terms of what? Let me just tell you this. Let me just tell you this. Youíre asking me aboutÖ In no way do I remember the girls leading these parties. They might have had them amongst themselves and we didnít know. But what are you getting at here? ìWhat were the boys like?î Well, youíre asking me. Mine were in the sixties. This is in 1982, í83, í84 ó and today, itís 36 years ago! Which makes this even that much more absurd.  "

Jesus himself might not be able to pass it, but thatís okay. They donít believe in him. I mean, thatís how ridiculous all of this is.  "

And, really, so the bleeding heart liberals, the compassionate people, theyíre the ones that are discrediting women more than anybody over playing this kind of cry wolf game for political gain. I just think: Shame on them. You know, women have struggled for so many years to be taken as seriously in the workplace.RUSH: Yes.CALLER: And now we have women going around making these false claims, making us look unstable and using this card to get gain fromÖ You know, from these accusations óRUSH: So it sounds to me like what youíre really saying is that youíre not all that certain Democrats really care about the plight of women, if theyíre this willing to put somebody up with this lack of credibility thatís going to then redound to other women and make them seem less credible and the Democrats may not even care about that.CALLER: The Democrats only care about themselves, and theyíll use any person as a tool for their credit, for their gain.RUSH: No question about that.CALLER: They do not care about us.RUSH: You know, Iíve heard this argument, and on paper it make sense. Ellen, thanks for the call. And really thanksÖ Itís been 1988, í89. Thatís a lifer. Something like 30 years. You know, we have audience research, you would be stunned to learn how many people are in that category, out of ourÖ.You know, weekly audience here is up to 26 million. Youíd be stunned how many. I was when we found out. Anyway, I hear this argument that, ah, this is really going to harm other women, whoíre gonna be reluctant to come forward because theyíre not gonna be believed.And Iíve heard the argument about rape, same time. If a woman comes forward with a false allegation that is demonstrated to be false, that that then harms other women to whom it did happen, who may not be believed. And, as I say, logically on paper it makes sense. Iím not sure Iíve seen any evidence of it. I would love to be corrected on this.But, for example, there have been other womenÖ Did Anita Hill stop Christine Blasey Ford from coming forward? Quite the contrary. Anita HillÖ I have a story that details the stardom that she has received following supposedly risking it all to come forward about Clarence Thomas! And this is another myth that these womenÖ ìThey really run the risk of becoming fools forever and destroying their lives and losing it all, Mr. Limbaugh.îWell, you know, Anita Hill kind of bombed out in her effort to keep Clarence Thomas off the court, but books by Anita Hill: ìSpeaking Truth to Power. Reimagining Equality: Stories of Gender, Race, and Finding Home. In popular culture: In 1999 Ö Strange Justice, a film based on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy. Her case also inspired the 1994 Law & Order episode Virtue, about a young lawyer who feels pressured to sleep with her supervisor at her law firm,î based on Anita Hill.ìHill was the subject of the 2013 documentary film Anita Ö which chronicles her experience during the Clarence Thomas scandal. Hill was portrayed by actress Kerry Washington in the 2016 HBO film Confirmation. Hill is mentioned in the 1992 Sonic Youth song Youth Against Fascism. Awards and recognition Ö American Bar Associationís Commission on Women in the Professionís Women of Achievement award in 1992.ìIn 2005, Hill was selected as a Fletcher Foundation Fellow. In 2008 she was awarded the Louis P. and Evelyn Smith First Amendment Award by the Ford Hall Forum.î Thatís not even half the page of the awards and movies and books that she has written, appeared in, or been portrayed in. Sheís wealthy. She has jobs at major universities. Thereís not one negative thing that happened to Anita Hill for losing!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Jean in Ponca City, Oklahoma. Youíre next. Iím glad you waited.CALLER: Hi. I found the names of at least 10 women ó thereís more ó that said they were abused by Bill Clinton, and Iím concerned about where they could go to get a do-over and be believed. I was wondering if you could direct them to anywhere.RUSH: (chuckles) Thatís been tried. Juanita Broaddrick is one of them. By the way, I think now people credibly accept that she was raped by Bill Clinton. The left doesnít even deny it. Juanita Broaddrick is saying, ìYou know, why doesnít the FBI come and investigate what happened to me? I remember exactly what happened. I remember where I was. I remember what he did. I remember everything about it,î and the only network that ever gave this the time of day was NBC. Only one reporter. Everybody else ignores it ó and the Clinton women were destroyed. Remember James Carville talk about Paula Jones?CALLER: Right.RUSH: (impression) ìThis is what happens when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park! Ha-ha-ha!î You know, and Hillary Clinton was right in there destroying all these women that came forward that had detail after detail after day about what Bill Clinton had done to them.CALLER: Right. Itís a long list. Itís a long list here, and all the accusations and I just wish they could be heard.RUSH: Well, some of them have been, but the point is, after theyíre heard, theyíre ignored. Nobody does anybody about it. The media actually continues trying to make people not believe them, and here we have an allegation that doesnít have any substance to it at all, and itís being treated as gospel. Itís maddening. I just saw on Fox, by the wayÖ This is stuff, when I hear this, I say, ìThis canít be true. It just canít be.îBut some infobabe on Fox said that internal White House polling shows too much complacence among Trump voters leading into the November elections, that theyíre not all that hepped up to vote. Trump voters think, ìTrump won. Trumpís continuing to do good things. What do I need to care about?î Now, I justÖ That does not compute with me, unless there isÖ There is one way. Unless these people have just tuned out the news ícause theyíre so fed up with it.They just donít watch it, in which case they may not be even aware whatís going on here with Kavanaugh. But, see, that doesnít make sense to me, either. Of course, the Trump administration might just be feeding that news to reporters so that their voters hear it and donít get complacent. I donít know. I know Iím daily immersed in this and Iím emotionally attached and invested in it, and so that does tend to warp your judgment if youíre not careful.You think everybody is, and then you realize a lot of people do not follow this stuff as do you and I. You realize if more people did, there might be a bigger backlash. I justÖ But this is not a one-off. This is what weíve been dealing with for three years now if you go back and include the campaign. We have been dealing with this kind of literal injustice and and stark unfairness. Whatever else this is, it is the epitome of a stacked deck, unfairness.It is fueled by lies and perversion and distortion, and anybody paying attention to it would have to be outraged by it if they have any decency in them at all! See, thatís the naive me speaking. You would think that would be the normal, everyday reaction. But I donít know that it is. Grab sound bites 10 and 11. Yesterday we learned that the lawyer for the accuser, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the lawyer Debra Katz said, ìItís not up to her to prove anything. The accuser doesnít have to corroborate anything!îThat caught me flat-footed.I said, ìWhat? The accuser doesnít have to corroborate. Go talk to any prosecutor. The prosecutor has to damn well corroborate, confirm, prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, all thatî in a court. Now, in the court of real life, yeah, defendants often have to prove they didnít do it even though proving a negative is practically impossible. But in this case this woman comes forth after 36 years of nothing and lays out this allegation and now does not have to offer proof?In what world?Well, in this world, because here is none other than ìAn-ee-tah,î as pronounced by Judge [Susan] Hoerchner back in 1991. Anita Hill was on Good Morning America today with George Stephanopoulos. Yeah, sheís so traumatized! Anita Hill still quivering in fear, cowering in the corners over what happened to her. Stephanopoulos said, ìYouíve said that Judge Kavanaugh bears the burden of persuasion here. What does that mean, exactly?îHILL: It is an honor and a privilege to be nominated and to serve. It is not an entitlement, and so a person coming into that position on the Supreme Court for a lifetime really has to have the full confidence of the American public. We need to be able to believe in the integrity of our courts, and that means believing in the integrity of the individuals who are on it.RUSH: Stephanopoulos said, ìYour hearings famously came just five days after the allegations went public.îHILL: (haltingly) TheseÖ take time Ö to evolve. So six days is not enough for the senators who probably know very little about these kinds of claims.RUSH: Right.HILL: Itís not enough for them to inform themselves, and so thatís why itís important to have an investigation.RUSH: See?HILL: Itís important for them then to call on experts to help them shape credible questions to ask both Dr. Blasey and Judge Kavanaugh and then to move forward. There is no reason for them to rush this.RUSH: The hell there isnít! The hell there isnít! Anyway, so, here you have ìAn-ee-tah,î saying that the burden of persuasion is on the nominee. This guy is gonna serve for life. Itís up to him to convince us that heís worth it. So anybody can come along at any time and say, ìHe abused me! He sat on top of me! He laid on top of me! He smelled of booze! He was drunk and so forth and Iíve been traumatized for 36 years,î and that, with no evidence backing him up, can stop everything?Thatís where we are. Craft questions. Investigators can craft questions. Meanwhile, she doesnít want to show up. Sheís got an open invitation to show up ó by the way, not just in public. If she wants to testify behind closed doors, theyíve offered that. GrassleyÖ According to an anonymous source at CNN, Grassleyís even willing to go to California to interview her. The United States Senate Judiciary Committee on the road. Whenís the last time you think that ever happened?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This does it. John Danforth, senator from Missouri, big friend of Clarence Thomas He loved Clarence Thomas. Clarence Thomas worked for him. He sponsored Clarence Thomas. He remembers the Anita Hill-Thomas hearings. He was on Wolf Blitzer this afternoon. Jim Acosta accosted him and said, ìYou were against the delay in the Thomas hearings. Do you think a delay now is out of order? Is it unacceptable, in your view?îDANFORTH: What I said back then, and it definitely was true, was that the whole thing was torture. And for a human being, Clarence obviously controversial. But he was a friend of mine, and everything that he lived for was under attack. You know, it was really awful, and he was just humiliated by the whole darned experience. So this is like reliving that. I donít know Judge Kavanaugh, but for him. I mean, hereís a man whoís had just a sterling reputation, and clearly his reputation means a great deal to him, and now all thatís in the trash.RUSH: ìAll of that is in the trash.î Precisely. Itís all in the trash, and the left is happy. The left is applauding. By the way, folks, if you think that you can encounter a liberal or a leftist and have a rational discussion with them about this, I want to warn you in advance: You canít. Now, there are exceptions to everything, but my experience guided by intelligence is that you do not want the frustration of trying to discuss this reasonably. You, as a decent person, are gonna be talking to someone who is poisoned with political hatred for Donald Trump and thus is incapable of reason and is more easily led to believe that Brett Kavanaugh is scum than the truth about Brett Kavanaugh.If youíre gonna try it, just be warned.Itís not gonna turn out the way you think.

Hey, love the show, longtime listener. I do have to disagree with you on one thing about this whole Kavanaugh thing. I know youíre saying that itís to delay, delay, delay. I disagree. I think the whole #MeToo movement, the whole segment you just played about the senator saying, ìShut up, men,î I think all this is about removing the men from the public sphere. You know? I think thatís the wholeÖ I mean the whole concept of whatís going on right now is to make every man out there scared to death. And, you know, that way they can kind of know-tow us all and make us just say, uh, ìWell, look itís not worth it,î and then even when you have somebody like Collins who, you know, is a moderate Republican. You know, itís still female voices. I think Kavanaugh gets through, but I think the next judge has to be a woman.RUSH: You think that has to be because of what women are doing? You think the only way that we can get somebody on the court is for her to be a woman?CALLER: Oh, yeah.RUSH: Well, you know, there was a woman that was on the list, equally as high on Trumpís list as was Kavanaugh. And they didnít go for her first. I forget what the thinking was. Iím having a mental block on her name, but she was and is highly reputed. My memory is that though decided to go with Kavanaugh first on the basis of his qualifications being such that there couldnít be any reasonable opposition to him. Ha-ha-ha-ha.But more importantly, they wanted to wait for a female nominee for the next opening. (interruption) Yeah, Amy Coney Barrett is the name that was being bandied about, coequal with Kavanaugh. They decided on Kavanaugh because, A, ìHeís impeccable! Canít get anybody better. Thereís nobody better judicially, intellectually, emotionally. Nobody better. No legitimate reason to oppose the guy,î was the thinking. They didnít want to throw Amy Cohen Barrett up until there was maybe a vacancy, say, from Ruth Ginsburg or Elena Kagan or Sonia Sotomayor.And they thought it would be more advantageous to her to have her nominated to fill a seat vacated by a woman. Now, I think all this kind of thinking is cockamamie, and it does demonstrate what weíve all known for years, and that is the Supreme Court is just a political institution. Itís long since been abandoned as what it was originally intended to be. But your thought that what this really is, is an all-out assault on men everywhere and a desire to keep a men out of positions of power.Folks, do not discount that as being something that several literally (sigh) lunatic people on the left think. Theyíve been taught this in years and years of Womenís Studies courses. ìAll sex is rape, including the sex in marriage.î I mean, women in two straight generations, if not more, have literally been poisoned with male hatred, hatred for men on college campuses across the country. So there is an element of truth to that.But I do believe that this particular instance is about delay and specifically rooted in polling data that makes the Democrats think they can win the Senate. Mazie Hirono from Hawaii ó who said men should just shut up and go away or step up and do right thing. She said that the Democrats could keep the seat open on the Supreme Court vacant. They could keep it for ítil after the 2020 election if Kavanaughís nomination collapses.ìIf the Democrats regain control of the Senate in November,î she said (paraphrased). ìWe can keep this seat open ítil Trumpís gone. We donít have to fill this seat. We donít have to. Whoever he sends up, we donít have to vote on íem ever.î So this is a plan. Believe me, folks, Kavanaugh is seen as not an Anthony Kennedy. Anthony Kennedy was the centrist moderate, go with the left. Now, Kavanaughís not that. They are petrified of Kavanaugh and losing any semblance of control over the court, and then the next nomination after that? They are petrified.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Yeah, there was one ó Amy Coney Barrett ó and there was one other thing. She was the nominee that Dianne Feinstein said, ìThe dogma lives loudly in you,î meaning your Catholicism, your dogma. ìYou really believe the dogma!î Of course, that was code lingo for, ìThis woman is way too anti-abortion.î Thatís why they withheld her.

I want to share some things with you that may be fake news, but if theyíre not fake, I want to be on record as having had them for you. Thereís a Twitter thread out there. I have no idea the veracity because, as you know, I do not ìtwit.î But this particular thread claims that the reason that Dianne Feinstein was reluctant to go public with Christine Blasey Fordís letter is because she received a similar letter from the woman about Judge Gorsuch. No idea whether this is fake news or true.But given who weíre talking about here, I can believe that it would be true, ícause I think weíre dealing with genuinely disturbed, emotionally depraved, poisoned-with-hatred lunatics. I have no idea if itís true. Thereís another bit of news going around that has a little bit more credibility but still it doesnít pass the ìdefinitely happenedî test. It is that Peter Strzok Smirk and Lisa Page were caught destroying evidence on their final days at the FBI. Neither two bits of news can be confirmed.

I have my gut reaction to it, and then I backed off and I started thinking about it. Itís a tweet from Senator Susan Collins. Susan Collins is from Maine. She is buddy-buddy with Lisa Murkowski from Alaska. Theyíre two Republican senators who are constantly thought to be on the bubble, and whenever there is a judicial nominee for any position, but especially the Supreme CourtÖIt is said that if there is any, the slightest indication that that nominee might not be thinking the right way on abortion, then Susan Collins and Murkowski will vote with Democrats to kill the nomination. And because of this, the Democrats are constantly applying pressure to both of them. And they have been working overtime to try to pressure Susan Collins to commit to voting against Kavanaugh because of their claims that he would reverse Roe v. Wade and all that paranoia that the Democrats have.And she resisted. So the next thing they did is they created a GoFundMe campaign for a phantom candidate to oppose her in the Senate campaign for Maine. That GoFundMe campaign or however they funded it reached a million dollars. They were trying to blackmail her. They were telling her, ìIf you will commit to voting against Kavanaugh, then weíll pull this money out of the race against you and we will not assist the candidate who opposes you.î She didnít buck to that. So when that failed, they sent her ó and Iím not making this up.Iím sorry I have to tell you, but they sent her a-three-foot cardboard cutout of male genitalia in another attempt to ó I donít know what ó bully her or offend her, and she said, ìThis is it. Iíve had enough of this. Iíve enough of these anti-Kavanaugh tactics.î So thatís Susan Collins, and she has been, as I say, target for much bullying and manipulation by the left. So she sent a tweet out a little over an hour ago. Her tweet says, Iím writing to the Chairman [and ranking member] of Judiciary [Committee]Öî That would be Grassley and Feinstein.ìIím writing to the Chairman & RM of Judiciary Cmte respectfully recommending that at Mondayís hearing, counsel for Prof. Ford be allocated time to question Judge Kavanaugh & counsel for the Judge be granted equal time to question Prof. Ford, followed by questions from Senators.î My first reaction when I saw that was, ìWhy donít we just cash in the chips now and say the country as we knew it is over?î Weíre now officially the Jerry Springer Show in the United States Senate, or take your pick.Whatever daytime soap opera fare that people watch. Are we serious about this, that lawyers for Professor Ford be allowed time to question Kavanaugh, and that his lawyers be allowed time to question her? By the way, sheís still has not responded to the invitation to show up to this thing on Monday. I think they ought to bag this and just do the vote on Thursday. To hell with it! Just bag it and do it. But they wonít because theyíre afraid of losing it now. But that doesnít matter. The committee vote doesnít matter.Mitch McConnell can schedule a full Senate vote on this nominee without the committee voting. Itís just Senate protocol that the Judiciary Committee has a vote and then thatís supposed to inform the rest of the Senate that itís okay to vote for the guy or that they shouldnít. I mean thatís how silly it is. The Judiciary Committee vote is not gonna determine how people in the general population of the Senate vote.

What should have been a moment of great pride and overwhelming love and excitement was turned into a despicable, embarrassing spectacle that was beneath all of the decency this country is known for. And it was by design. If they allow that to happen during confirmation hearings, can you imagine what this thing on Monday would become? So lawyers interrogate her; then other lawyers interrogate him.This man is a nominee to be on the United States Supreme Court! An allegation that her lawyers say she doesnít even have to prove? And then after all that, blowhard senators get their turn asking questions? Dianne Feinstein, Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin? Susan Collins then tweeted, ìSuch an approach would provide more continuity, elicit the most information & allow an in-depth examination of the allegations.î (sigh) That is justÖ Folks, whatever it is, it is a gigantic come-down.At any rate, all this notwithstanding, her tweet probably will send the Democrats into orbit with rage, ícause they were counting on flipping her. They were counting on her saying before this even began that sheís had enough. ìThis is the last straw! I canít support the guy. Look at whatís being said. I canít possiblyÖî Thatís what they were hoping Collins would say. Now she wants to see a circus. Kavanaughís lawyerÖ Heís hired a lawyer; I should tell you this. Brett Kavanaughís hired Beth Wilkinson. Does the name ring a bell?Does anybody know who Beth Wilkinson is? A, sheís the wife of David Gregory of CNN/NBC. B, she represented Hillary Clinton staffers during the FBI investigation into Clintonís private server. Those staffers were Cheryl Mills, Jake Sullivan, Heather Samuelson, and Philippe Reines. Sheís also said to be a stellar lawyer, and apparently one of her specialties is defamation ó attacking and defending defamation accusations ó which is exactly what this is.This is an up-front attempt to defame and destroy Brett Kavanaugh. I was just saying yesterday, ìWe opposed some of the nominees the Democrats put forward. When is the last time you remember anybody on our side trying to literally destroy the life and career and reputation of a political opponent, any more so than they already had?î I mean, with Bill Clinton there was evidence. He did it. Nothing was made up.And all those people defending Bill Clinton saying it doesnít matter, itís just sexñ Hillary Clinton and all these other people responsible for trashing these women that came forward ó are now the same people claiming that Kavanaugh is scum and that this woman (whoís never said a word about any of this for 36 years) is eminently believable.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now back to Doug in Chicago.

Youíre saying that she can do what no male senator can do today that Specter did with Anita Hill.CALLER: And she can serve up points, so all the senator do are following up on a point that she raised. Itís not their bigot, the misogynism. Itís a point that she made to another female. I just donít see how they can sit there and say, ìThese men, these old Grumpy Old Men,î when the point has been raised by a female attorney in the course of the conversation.RUSH: Okay.CALLER: I think sheís probably more of a litigant attorney than the womanís attorney.RUSH: Okay.CALLER: So I think Kavanaugh does great and óRUSH: Okay. I got you. But beyond theÖ Let me just ask you a question. You obviously think that what Collins is tweeted here sets up a very advantageous circumstance for Republican senators on the committee which, otherwise, theyíd be hampered. What do you think of the whole concept here of this spectacle on Monday where you have the accuserÖ? Youíve got Judge Kavanaugh about whom nobody has ever said anything like this, and here he is on defense. By definition, heís on defense with lawyers running around in there plus all these senators on this committee. What is your overall opinion of the whole spectacle that it would be?CALLER: I think itís a disgrace, and it makes the original hearings look passive, and I think it was a ploy.

Hello.CALLER: A longtime listener and absolutely thrilled to be able to talk to you.RUSH: Thank you very much. Itís great to have you here.CALLER: Uh-huh. Iím gonna get to my point very quickly. I was telling the screener that the postponement ítil Monday of the circus thatís going to come only gives people who support Kavanaugh a time to build him up, as has already started and his attorney time to unravel some of the things that are truthful things. They donít have to make stuff up. They donít have to pull anything. They just have to present this accuserís lifestyle, her demonstrations that sheís been involved with. Iíve heard some things about possibly a grudge thing with her parents and óRUSH: That turns out to be not true.CALLER: Okay.RUSH: Thatís another thing. Youíve got to be very careful here.CALLER: Yes.RUSH: We had that story yesterday. Kavanaughís mother did not foreclose against this womanís parents. It was just, in fact, maybe the opposite. It was fake news that was out there yesterday.CALLER: But I just think it gives them some extra days to do some truth checking on those things and her testimony and her personality will come to light just as Brett Kavanaughís will.RUSH: Okay.CALLER: I just think that it gives them extra time to unravel her testimony. You know, Iím on his side. I really support him.RUSH: Oh, I understand. I just donít think Democrat senators are gonna allow what you just described to happen.CALLER: Even if Brett Kavanaughís lawyer is asking the questions to her?RUSH: The Senate runs the show, and itís not a courtroom. Itís the United States Senate. It will be the Judiciary Committee hearing, and they can shut down anybody any time.CALLER: I see.RUSH: If they think that Kavanaughís lawyer is being mean, unnecessarily contentious, accusatory, other legal terms, they can shut it down. Of course, you think Dick Durbin wonít stand and do head stands? Look, I realize what youíre saying. The theory is that with Beth Wilkinson as the lawyer for Kavanaugh that she will be more easily able to really bore into and expose the accuser as a fraud, if she is, whereas a male senator couldnít do it because of the #MeToo movement and feminism and all that. But another woman could. (sigh) Look, it may be true, but then the question becomes, ìWould Kavanaughís female lawyer do that anyway?î I donít know. Weíre dealing with swamp-dwellers here, folks.Thatís as much as Iím gonna say.  "

On CNN Internationalís Newsroom, they were talking about the allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. The anchor, John Vause, was talking to Democrat strategerist Caroline Heldman.VAUSE: Hereís how Rush Limbow (sic) put it on Monday on his talk-back (sic) radio showÖRUSH: If this woman did not want this taken any farther, then the Democrats are betraying her ó and I donít believe the Democrats are betraying her. I think she is part of a cabal doing everything they can to stop Kavanaugh or, if they canít stop him, to cast such a cloud.VAUSE: Whatís the likelihood that she made it all up?HELDMAN: The likelihood that she made it up, according to the FBI, general statistics is 2 to 8%. But in her particular case, sheís taken a lie detector test. And of the 65 women who came forward to support Brett Kavanaugh, when Politico went to speak with them, only two of them still backed up their claim that he was a good guy!RUSH: Thatís not true!HELDMAN: If somebody murders somebody you can find 100 people to say that personís a good guy.RUSH: Wait a minute! Stop it! That is not true! That is not what happened! (sigh) Here we go again. Okay. So this is Caroline Heldman, and she is a Democrat strategist, and note the way she says that we can trust the allegations. Well, the likelihood that she made it up according to FBI statistics is 2 to 8%. So thereís a 98 to 92% chance that sheís telling the truth, and thatís we on the left need, FBI statistics. And then she launches in: She took a lie detector test.Yeah, given to her by her lawyer, whoís funded and paid off by George Soros.ìAnd of the 65 women who came forward to support Brett Kavanaugh, when Politico went to speak with them, only two of them still backed up their claim that he was a good guy!î Thatís not true! Only two of them wanted to go public. None of them withdrew their claims about Kavanaugh being upright and a decent guy. None of them changed their minds. They just didnít want to go public ícause they donít want to be part of the circus. Two of them did and they appeared last night on the Fox News Channel.So theyíre just outright lying here about the statistics and the degree to which the accuser may be telling the truth and making up things about the women that are supporting Kavanaugh kind of peeling off now. That number is not 65. Itís 200. Thereís a scholar at the Hoover Institution (which is part of the Stanford campus out in Palo Alto) Richard Epstein. Heís a brilliant guy, and heís written about this.I want to give you some excerpts of what he has said about this, ícause Iím sure this is one of those things when you read it, when you hear it, youíre gonna be saying, ìYeah, yeah, yeah! I wish I had said that.î This last-ditch decision to sabotage Kavanaugh at the 11th hour is a disgusting piece of political propaganda. By the way, Iím leaving parts out where he says sheís to be believed and we give her the benefit of the doubt. Heís been totally open and fair-minded about her. But now he gets into the tactics.ìChristine Blasey Ford behaved wholly improperly when she decided to write a letter only to ëa senior Democratic lawmaker,í in which she made the most serious allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh. At the very least, she ought to have handled matters wholly differently. If she wanted to keep matters confidential, she should have sent that letter to President Trump and to Senator Chuck GrassleyÖìShe also should have sent it to the FBI for investigation. And she should have done all of these things at the earliest possible moment, in time for a principled and neutral examination to take place before the Senate hearings took place. Then, she should have sat for a cross-examination.î Well, heís exactly right. She didnít do any of this. ìPutting the information exclusively in the hands of key Democrats thus invited the wholly corrupt strategy that has now unfolded. First, the Democrats would try to discredit Kavanaugh by engaging in a set of procedural antics and obnoxious substantive questions during the hearing, without mentioning this letter. When that strategy abjectly failed, they knew they had to go to Plan B, which was to release the letter and the allegation days before the confirmation vote.ìA perfect sandbag, for the Democrats knew full well that there was no time to respond to them, without causing an enormous delay in the confirmation hearings. Their hope was, and is, to create a huge media circus that would take weeks if not months to sort out. Shipwreck this nomination.î Wave goodbye to Kavanaugh. ìMake it impossible for the current Senate to pass on any subsequent nominee before January. Then take control of the Senate and create a stalemate that could run on until the next presidential election.ìAnd for what? Ford, Kavanaughís accuser, maintained a stony silence on these allegations for more than 35 years. At no point did she raise them in connection with the Senate confirmation hearings before Kavanaugh was confirmed in 2006. Kavanaugh has categorically denied the allegations. Late last week, Mark Judge, his alleged accomplice, denounced the allegations as ëabsolutely nuts.í No other woman has ever made any allegation of this sort against Kavanaugh, and 65 women,î now 200, by the way, ìhave written an explicit letter in his defense.ìKavanaugh is right not to respond beyond his categorical denial, knowing full well that further comment would only draw him further into a vortex on which credibility determinations would be unending. And the Senate is right to continue with the confirmation voteî on Thursday, especially if they do not have an acknowledgment from Christine Ford that sheís even gonna show up for this my call hearing on Monday.Now Chuck Schumer and the Democrats are saying, ìWait a minute. You canít just do a hearing with her and Kavanaugh. We need all kinds of witnesses! We need Mark Judge in there. We need all kinds of witnesses. You canít just have her and him in there.î Well, wait a minute, I thought thatís what everybody wanted at first. Weíre gonna have her in there and weíre gonna have him in there and weíre gonna make a decision as to whoís telling the truth, right?Do you realize what a circus thatís gonna be Monday, if this were to actually happen? Do you realize? How many Code Pink people the Democrat senators gonna let in! What kind of an abject, humiliating, embarrassing-for-the-country circus do the Democrats have planned if this hearing on Monday actually happens? This is an abomination, what theyíre doing. The destroying the life and career of a great American, sullying and erasing the basic tenets of the United States Constitution. It just pains me that more average Americans are not livid about this, outraged at this, and ready to punish Democrats like theyíve never been punished at the ballot box in November.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, does the FBI keep statistics on rape? Iím asking because I didnít know they investigated that crime. But where does that come from, 2% ofÖ? What is it, only 2% lie, only 2% of women lie? I think thatís statistics from that Susan Brownmiller book. Brownmiller. She wrote the definitive book on rape. Itís not about sex. Itís about power and violence. I forget the name of the book, but I donít think thatís an FBI stat. Anyway, this Democrat strategist cited it on CNN International last night.  "

I would like them to answer to me and other women who may have been victims of anything related to this. What kind of damage are you doing to the American women in general by bringing up an accusation that you cannot prove that is most likely completely bogus? The American people can smell BS a mile away. Theyíre a good-natured and fair-minded people, and this smells to the high heavens, first of all.And second of all, it is a huge disservice to actual victims. They wonít ever be believed, and this will go on and on and on, unless this congressional Senate puts a stop to it. I agree with you that they need to vote on Thursday, and I would betÖ I donít have a lot of money, but I would bet this woman will not show up because the world is watching, and sheís weighing her options, trying to figure out how she can come across as believable when sheís probably lying. And the actual people in this country who will never come forward with their stories are being done a great disservice by someone like Dianne Feinstein and the entire Democratic Party. And Iím infuriated.RUSH: Youíre right. And, by the way, this is not the first time. There have been similar examples involving race. This one happens to involve sex. But there have been numerous efforts the Democrats have made which have actually resulted in real victims not being believed when theyíve come forward because of the circus that attached itself to something that was bogus like this. So you reallyÖ? You donít believe this woman?CALLER: Not at all. I am a woman, and I did have a similar experience to her allegation in high school.

You have to put in the fact that Dianne Feinstein knew about this apparently six weeks ago and didnít say anything. In closed sessions, she didnít say anything. They are using this because they will use anything, they will do anything to destroy anyone that Trump puts forward. If they get rid of Kavanaugh, he puts up somebody else.They will use somebody and somebody else to come up in the last hour to accuse that person.

He was older; a grad student. Afterwards, he took me to his apartment and tried to rape me. I got away unscathed, but I remember precisely where it happened. I donít remember his name, as I never had another encounter with him, and I did not know him before the date. But to not remember the house, to not remember the street, to not remember what the room looked like, to not remember where it happened is inconceivable to me.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/17/an-orchestrated-democrat-smear/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 17, 2018RUSH: Okay. So Kavanaugh has been sayingÖ By the way, Kavanaugh went to the White House today. The White House is standing behind Kavanaugh. They are continuing to sponsor his nomination, as we would expect to be the case. This accuser has covered a lot of ground in a very short period of time. As recently as last Wednesday, last Thursday, she didnít want to be known. She didnít want this carried any further than the letter she wrote to Senator Feinstein.She didnít want the FBI looking into it. She didnít want any part of it. And then on the eve of the vote that would lead to the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, Dianne Feinstein held the letter up and said (paraphrased), ìI got this letter here! I got this letter from a woman, who said unspecified horrible things happened to her. Iíve had it for a while here, and I think Iím gonna refer this to the FBI for investigation.î The FBI took a look at it and one of the first things I saw, anyway, was the FBI was not going to investigate it.It didnít take long for a woman who did not want to be known and the details of her story she didnít want known to now she has said she wants to come testify as well. Senator Grassley, who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has said (summarized), ìWell, weíre gonna treat her with all the respect we would treat anybody else whoís been invited to testify. Weíre gonna bring her up here, extend the invitation.î There is some talk that she might want to do her testifying behind closed doors.Now, that is not usually afforded. If youíre gonna do something like this, you testify in public, under oath. Now, where it stands now is Kavanaugh has said heíll go anywhere, anytime to tell anybody whatever it is they want to know about this. He maintains he didnít do it, he didnít even know who this woman was. He hasnít the slightest idea what this is about. Which is very close to what Justice Thomas said, except that he knew Anita Hill.He couldnít figure it out because Anita Hill practically had a crush on him, was following him everywhere he went. Every new job he got, she tried to tag along. In this case, Kavanaugh is saying he didnít even know who she was ó and heís not sure now that he knows who she is. Kavanaugh has a friend, a guy named Mark Judge, who was, according to the accuser, in the room at the same time Kavanaugh was doing the nasty, allegedly doing the nasty. And this guy says that didnít happen.(summarized) ìIím telling you, whatever she says, I donít remember a thing of this. None of this happened.î But the problem is that Mark Judge has written a book about what a drunkard he was in high school (chuckling) and reliving his days about how they were all just drunk and happy and doing whatever whenever they wanted to and so forth. So itís kind ofÖ Ah, itís a little bit of a weakening of his testimony here when he says he doesnít remember because he admits that similar times in high school he was one who consumed significant quantities of adult beverage.So I still maintainÖ You know, the committee hearing vote, the Judiciary CommitteeÖ The way these things normally happen is the Judiciary Committee votes on a nominee, and if the nominee passes the committee, then the vote goes to full Senate. Mitch McConnell, if he wanted to ó The Turtle. He could go for a full-fledged Senate vote without a committee vote. He can do that. He is the Senate leader. So he can schedule a vote on the nominee whether there is a Judiciary Committee vote or not.The question then becomes, ìWould he violate tradition and the gentlemanly, courtly rules of the Senate in such a fashion?î And if he did, what would be the outcome of that vote? Would there be so many senators, courtly and gentlemanly outraged that this violation of Senate etiquette that they would vote against the nominee just for that reason alone? Where do we stand on senators? Well, weíve had the brave and courageous Senators Corker and Jeff Flake at the first opportunity they could say, ìWhoa. We need to pull back.ìI donít think I can vote for this nominee now until I learn more.î Now, with both these guys, Iím pretty safe in saying that what is governing them is their Never Trumper status ó their genuine, undiluted animus for Donald Trump ó and thus their desire to screw with his every plan, be it a judicial appointment or be it an agenda item or policy, if these guys can. Flake, of course, is leaving the Senate. He would not have been reelected had he tried, probably would have lost even in the primary.But thereís a lot of bitterness. Thereís a lot of lingering bitterness and rancor in the Republican Party over the fact that Trump won. And thereís still an effervescing desire on the part of some Republicans to pay Trump back and deny Trump any victories so that they can join the Democrats in trying to get rid of Donald Trump. But every Republican vote would be needed in order to confirm Kavanaugh. If they lose two, now weíre down, you know, to 50-50. Thereís some red state senators that were gonna vote for Kavanaugh.Particularly if it appeared that Kavanaugh was gonna be confirmed, Schumer was gonna quietly tell a bunch of red state Democrats that if itíll little help here in your reelection, go ahead and vote for the guy. So we were looking at potentially 55 or 56 votes for Kavanaugh, which would include some Democrats like Joe Manchin from West Virginia. But if Corker and Flake peel off then that will give these red state Democrats all the cover they need to also peel off. And we could now be beyond the point where the vote of the vice president would put Kavanaugh over the top.So look. If sheís gonna make the allegations, I guess you have to bring her up and let her testify. The question then becomes, ìWill she?î Says she wants to. But does anybody think sheís actually gonna show up this week and do it? The committee vote is Thursday. They want to get Kavanaugh confirmed before the midterms, the Republicans do, the Senate ó and the Republicans run the Senate right now. So if they want the vote to occur before the midterms, thatís when itís gonna occur, if the Republicans maintain testicular fortitude.Weíll just have to wait and see. The Democrats want to delay this until after the midterms for the obvious reason they think theyíre gonna win everything. They think theyíre gonna win the House and now they think theyíre gonna win the Senate because of the generic ballot polling. And if they win both, then theyíre gonna impeach Trump within six months of the new Congress being sworn in in January, and there wonít be any new nominees ícause theyíre gonna block anything Trump would send up there because they are still seething over Merrick Garland.Barack Hussein O nominated Garland to replace Justice Scalia after he passed away, and the Republicans said, ìWait a minute. Weíre not gonna have hearings in an election year. We might have a new president get elected; Hillary might lose. Weíre gonna wait for a new president to have this nominee.î Democrats were fit to be tied! Because the Supreme Court seat remained vacant for close to a year. Then of course Trump won, and that gave him the opportunity to nominate the placement for Scalia, and he nominated Neil Gorsuch.The Democrats have been seething ever since, and so calls for a quick appearance by the alleged victim ó demands that she show up this week and get this testimony over and done with ó Democrats are gonna say, ìWeíre in no hurry. You werenít in any hurry in order to confirm Merrick Garland. You delayed and delayed and eventually his nomination had to be pulled.î So we have a combination of things here.We have just standard, ordinary, everyday operational political strategy going on here combined with an attempt yet again by the left to destroy a decent person and his family. And that would be Brett Kavanaugh. The Democrats donít trust to be able to win on politics alone ó and itís not just Kavanaugh. They need to destroy anybody credible who opposes them. They need to ruin them. As such, I donít think decent people quite know how to deal with this. Decent people donít spend their day strategizing like this.And, as such, they donít end up being prepared for it. By definition, decent people are not prepared for this kind of thing. Not that theyíre ignorant to it. Itís just they donít go through each and every day studying and prepping on how to get ready for the next smear job from the Democrat Party. A couple of more little factoids about the accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. As I mentioned to you, she is a left-wing political activist.She has worn one of those vagina hats at some anti-Trump marches. She ìhas taken part in events opposing President Donald Trump, including a science march in California last year where she donned a version of the ëpóy hatsí worn at the January 2017 Womenís March. She ìis cited in a San Jose Mercury News article as wearing the hat at the march, which the newspaper said was held because people were ëangered by the Trump administrationís proposed cuts to research.'îShe also ìSigned [a] Letter Fighting Trump Border Enforcement ó Christine Blasey Ford ìsigned a letter fighting Trumpís ëZero Toleranceí policy at the U.S.-Mexico border. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ó an open borders advocacy organization ó letter was written and sent to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June.ìChristine Blasey Ford, a psychology professor, signed the ACLU letter as ëChristine Blasey Ph.D. PsychologistÖ'î So clearly sheís a political activist. Sheís an angry political activist. Sheís much more than just a victim of alleged attempted rape. She seems to be a little bit more politically attuned and aware than was Anita Hill. Now, remember Anita Hill, they had to drag her out of wherever she was. She did not voluntarily come forward.It was the wife of Illinois senator Paul Simon working with Howard Metzenbaum that went out there and dragged Anita Hill up, and they coached her. They got her fired up eventually, but they went out and found her at the last minute. This woman apparently sends the letter all on her own. But look, it all boils down to just what do we want to believe about the left? And the idea that any of this is spontaneous needs to be rejected.None of it is. The Democrats have been holding this. Theyíve been holding it for use at precisely this time, and Iím not sure I believe that Christine Blasey Ford never wanted to be made known. I donít believe she didnít want to go public. I donít believe that she sent a letter to Feinstein and then said, ìPlease do not do anything with this. Please do not forward this to the FBI. Please do not name me.î Why send it? I donít believe any of this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. Back to the phones we go to Bath, Michigan. This is Ray. Welcome, sir. Itís great to have you. Hi.CALLER: Hi. Yeah. I just wanted to make a quick point, and it ties right in with the ìnot-preparedî thing you were saying a moment ago here, and itís that this seems like itís lacking a lot of context. ëCause what weíve got is half the context where weíve been told a pretty ugly story about how she maybe was forced down onto a bed. But whatís the end? If you put it together it sounds like it ended with him not raping her, not doing horrible things to her, getting off the bed and respecting her boundaries.You know, in high school, all kinds of stuff happens, and sometimes guys and gals are on a different page. But it doesnít sound like if you tell the story in its full context that he did anything all too bad. It sounds like he didnít do a lot of bad things. And I think thatís why Kavanaugh didnít want to bring this forward, because it really isnít anything in its full context. Itís an assault from 36 years ago.RUSH: You think this is why Kavanaugh didnít bring it up? You think Kavanaugh remembered this, but thought itís not worth mentioning because óCALLER: Oh, no, no. Iím sorry. Dianne Feinstein. Iím a little nervous on the radio.RUSH: Oh. Oh, you think Feinstein knows that thereís really nothing to this and thatís why she was reluctant óCALLER: Right.RUSH: ó to bring it forth except when there was no other option?CALLER: Right. And, if you finish the story, well, thereís a lot of horrible ways it could end, but theyíre not leading with he did those horrible things, theyíre leading with that something inappropriate happened, but in the end it sounds like thereís a lot he didnít do.RUSH: Well itís óCALLER: Thatís my thought.RUSH: Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Itís ending with her being completely traumatized, with PTSD and finally going to a therapist six years ago after holding it in for all of those years. She finally went to a therapist. Her husband was in the therapy with her; she told the sordid details. Did she mention Kavanaughís name to the therapist or not? I donít think she did.It came out later, but, anyway, the point is, whether he did anything or not is not the point. She said she was ruined by it. Thatís all it takes. This is the #MeToo environment, donít forget. And a lot of Democrats have bitten the dust here. Weíve got Harvey Weinstein. We got Les Moonves. Thereís a whole bunch of them that had been taken out. The Democrats thinking itís time for some vice versa here, among many other things.The #MeToo movementís claimed a lot of people, most of them Democrats, and the objective here is not what really happened. In this case, itís how did she feel? If there was no completion of this abuse or whatever, but she still was psychologically scarred for the rest of her life by it, then it must have been typical brutish predator male behavior that we are not going to tolerate in this cisgender patriarchal society anymore, you see.CALLER: The bar has to be higher than things that happened in high school 36 years ago that did not get reported as crimes or werenít serious enough to yield reporting 30 years following. Thatís óRUSH: What bar hasÖ? There is no bar. Weíre talking about the Democrat Party here. Weíre talking if thereís a bar, itís how low it goes, notÖ I know what youíre saying.CALLER: Yeah. Yeah. I know what youíre saying. Yeah. Yeah.RUSH: But, I mean, youíve got Republican senators already caving and flowing off the reservation on this. Theyíre already accepting it for a host of otherÖ Look, this is my point. See, here, this guy, Ray, from Bath, Michigan, is a decent guy; itís perfectly reasonable to say, ìHigh school? Are you kidding me?î You know what happens when hormones are flowing in high school and young people are just discovering things and messing around, playing around and so forth?The bar has gotta be higher than that. Thereís not a person among us who was clean and pure as the wind-driven snow in high school or any other time in our lives, is his point. But, you see, thatís all mitigated by the fact that the left, the Democrat Party has an army to carry forth and conduct their war, and thatís the media. Theyíve got weapons upon weapons. The media fires them constantly day in and day out.And in the process, a circumstance has been created, a narrative has been created, that men have gotten away with being brutes and predators, mistreating women for centuries. And itís about time it came to a stop. And wherever the left says they find it, theyíre gonna stamp it out. Thereís no statute of limitations. If somebody claimed that Kavanaugh did whatever he did in kindergarten, the Democrats would be doing the same thing with it today as theyíre doing with this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, folks, I should share something with you that I heard this morning from a secret source, and it isÖ Just take this for what itís worth. Itís that the mind-set today at the U.S. Senate is that this is just a predictable and expected little speed bump and that Kavanaughís gonna end up being confirmed and that everybody knows it. Heís just gonna have to go through some motions here while the DemocratsÖ This is a Republican source. Actually, Iíve heard it from two different places.Thereís also a leftist commentator who shared with me that while everybodyís making a big deal about this that the quiet money on Capitol Hill that this really isnít gonna change anything. Itís just the last gasp. Just sharing that with you. You know, Grassley was ready to go and schedule it. Grassleyís initial reaction to this kind of indicates that that mind-set really is the case. Grassleyís original mind-set, original reaction to this was, ìWell, if weíre gonnaÖ Last minute stuff like this? We canít allow this to derail the scheduling and the normal functioning of the Senate.ìLast-minute stuff like this, unconfirmed, untested?î That was his initial reaction. Now heís saying, ìWell, uh, if she wants to testify, she will of course be allowed to testify according to several precedents and Senate rules and decorum and so forth. So I think itís probably true that even now the general mind-set is that this is not gonna derail Kavanaugh. But I think thatís subject to change hour by hour. You might also say, ìThatísÖ (laughing) These people are pretty naive if they think that,î and that could be true, too, but I wanted to pass it on to you.What else? Well, let me get back to the phones. I wanted to make this point anyway and itís come up right on schedule. Itís Frank in Atlanta. Welcome, sir. Youíre next on the EIB Network. Hi.CALLER: An honor to speak to you, Rush, after decades of listening to you. Iíll get to my point. I read an article today on TheFederalistPapers.org and they say that theyíre saying that Kavanaughís mother, whoís a judge, was the judge involved in foreclosing on the parentsí home of this lady thatís the accuser in Montgomery County, Maryland. Iím curious if you heard that. Theyíre showing pictures of the docket and óRUSH: Oh, yeah. Iíve got all that, and Iíve seen it two different places. If you know, thereís a reporter and columnist for Townhall.com named Kurt Schlichter. Anyway, heís looked into it. He confirms that itís every bit true. Here are the details of this. Christine Ford, Christine Blasey Ford, her ìparents were defendants in a case that was presided over by Brett Kavanaughís motherî who was the judge.ìChristine Fordís parents Paula K. Blasey and Ralph G. Blasey were the defendants in a foreclosure case in Maryland in 1996. Ö [T]he Judge was Ö [n]one other than Brett Kavanaughís mother, Martha G. Kavanaugh. Ö It appears there was an ongoing judgement starting at least in 1990Ö. [seven court] cases culminating in a foreclosure case in 1996, for which Martha Kavanaugh was the judge.ìThere was also a 1982 contract case but [this source] canít determine the details there. Ö Her father [Ralph G. Blasey] appears to have been an attorney Ö tons of cases referencing that. His relationship professionally with Kavanaugh should be looked I as well.î There are screenshots of the court documents here. So what do we have here? The accuser is by her own admissionÖ I mean, by her own bio, and she has spent the weekend scrubbing her social media sites. She tried to erase that she is an anti-Trumpist activist.She tried to delete and erase that sheís a left-wing activist. She tried to getÖ She wants to be seen as a college professorette who was traumatized by your average, run-of-the-mill white guy brute back in high school. And it turns out that this average, run-of-the-mill white guy brute now is nominated to be on the Supreme Court, and sheís outraged. So she doesnít know what to do. Come forth or not? She sent Senator Feinstein a letter but didnít know whether to go public with it or not., ìBut, gee, this is so unfair.ìThis guy brutes me and now heís gonna be the Supreme Court!î She doesnít want anybody to know that she wore one of those vagina hats at an anti-Trump March in January of 2017. She doesnít want anybody to know that she was an activist signing an ACLU letter opposing Trumpís attempts to shore up the southern border. She doesnít want anybody to know of her left-wing activism. But we do. Sheís a far-left, social justice warrior professor, and she has a grudge. It doesnít mean sheís a liar. But she has a grudge.Now, you combine who this woman is with the Drive-By Media and Dianne Feinsteinís months-long holding of all these ancient allegations for political advantage, and it is pretty clear that we have an orchestrated Democrat smear right out of the Anita Hill, Clarence Thomas playbook. They have no proof. They donít have a pattern, by the way. This is the only allegation of its kind about Brett Kavanaugh. They donít have anything. Every woman thatís ever worked with Kavanaugh has sung his praises.When this woman made known her allegations when her identity was forthcoming, women to the tune of 65 of them signed a letter in refutation what this woman was saying, that this is not Brett Kavanaugh. Heís not capable of this, he didnít do this, he doesnít think of women this way, doesnít treat women this way. There is no pattern. With Bill Clinton? Whew! We had a pattern, and they tried to sweep it under the rug. With Harvey Weinstein, we had a pattern. With Les Moonves, we have a pattern.With all Democrats who have benefit the dust, we have a pattern. We donít even have a pattern with Kavanaugh. We have a one-time allegation from 35 years ago from high school. What the Democrats have is something, again, absent any evidence. We donít have any evidence. Weíve got her word versus his. We donít have a shred of evidence. In fact, weíve got a third person in the room, Mark Judge, friend of Kavanaugh says it didnít happen. Heís befuddled by it. He doesnít remember any of this.Kavanaugh says (paraphrased), ìI never heard of this woman until today. I donít know who this woman is. Iíve never met this woman. I donít know where this thing happened.î The woman canít pinpoint the exact year it happened, by the way ó and from what Iím told, sheís not sure where it happened. Let me find that email. I got an email from somebody who wanted to weigh in on this. I may have to find it after the break. But itís a woman who had this happen to her, and she remembers everything about it.And she doesnít believe somebody who really felt like they been raped and abused in this way would forget so many assailant details. AnywayÖ So we donít have any evidence. We donít have any pattern. We have the old Democrat Party standby, ìthe seriousness of the charge,î which mandates in their world an investigation. Itís the same thing. If Republicans cave to this depravity, theyíre guaranteed to get more of it in the future. They will be enabling sick, depraved, indecent, leftist zealots. Itís time to stand up to this.The Republicans stood up to it with Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill, and it was none other than the late Arlen Specter shocking everybody. It was Arlen Specter who blew up the entire Democrat case. He ended up becoming a Democrat later in his life. I donít think he ever lived it down. But at that moment in time, he was awesome in defense of Justice Thomas. And in defense of the Senate for what was being done to it by this late-breaking thing with Anita Hill, nobody ever heard of in this light, in these kind of allegations, same thing here. Now we find out that Kavanaughís mother was the foreclosure judge on property owned by Christine Blasey Fordís parents.So there couldnít be any kind of a grudge there, right?  "

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/14/caller-wants-republicans-to-go-on-offense/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 14, 2018RUSH: Nick in Greensboro, North Carolina. Iím glad you took the time to call, sir. Hello.CALLER: Hey, Rush.RUSH: Hey!CALLER: Great to speak with you. Thanks for taking my call, and thanks to President Trump for listening ícause I know he listens to you every day. So I got a blue wave analogy I wanted to get you to comment on, and I think itís relevant. In the Super Bowl this year, anybody that watched it, will remember there was a fourth down trick play where Nick Foles caught a touchdown, but I donít think that was the fourth down play that won the game.There was a fourth and one late in the game about 5:44 to go and the Eagles were down one, and Peterson called a quick play. They completed a two-yard pass to Zach Ertz, and that was on the go-ahead scoring drive. And my point is, they didnít punt the ball even though conventional wisdom and establishment type coach would say punt. They kept the offense on the field in the waning time ícause they knew the other team had Brady. And in my opinion, and what I wanted you to comment on, is I think the Democrats have their own Tom Brady, and thatís the media.But the Republicans still have the ball, and itís fourth and two months to go; they got the House, the Senate, the presidency. So if they want to prevent a blue wave, donít punt it to Tom Brady and the media. Go on offense, bring back Obamacare appeal, border wall spending, tax cuts permanent, confirm Kavanaugh, win on your own terms. I think if they do that, they donít have anything to worry about. But I wanted to hear your comments on it.RUSH: Iím searching for something because you have just inspired a memory of something I have here in the Stack, and I know what it is even if I donít find it, but I want to try to find it to be able to share it with you almost on a verbatim basis. And itís gonna be in this other Stack and itís about the Puerto Rican hurricane. Now, hang on Nick, donít hang up. I want to be back to you here in just a second.Heís right about one thing in the Super Bowl. He was talking really fast there, but the Eagles did have a fourth and one and every rule in the book says punt, but it was late in the game, thereís no way they wanted to give the ball back to the Patriots. They wanted to keep it.They were definitely on offense. They wanted to convert a fourth down to first down and just keep ramming the ball down the throat of the Patriots and basically get a touchdown, which they did. It was a gutsy call, and it did precede the trick play, was which was the Philly Philly Special, which was the rollout pass to the quarterback.But that wasnít the big play. The big play of the Super Bowl was the way the Eagles executed that touchdown pass to their tight end, Ertz. There might have been some controversy over whether or not it was a catch. But that play is a play the Eagles had been running a certain way all season. They chose to run that play out of a different formation with motion for the first time all season, the Patriots had never seen it on tape.And the Patriots cornerbacks are running into each other trying to defend that play. That was the play of the Super Bowl. But it wouldnít have been made possible without the Philly Philly Special and the guy Foles that heís talking about here.But the lesson is offense, stay on offense, donít punt the ball back, donít trust the defense. Here we go. You say the Republicans need to go on offense, Nick. I want to ask you what this is. Iím holding here in my formerly nicotine-stained fingers a story from Reuters. Now, youíve heard that Trump claims there are not 3,000 deaths in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, right?CALLER: Yeah.RUSH: Okay. Youíve heard that Trumpís tweet says itís made up by the Democrats to make him look bad. You know the media is having a conniption fit over this because they claim that the estimate of deaths from George Washington University cannot be disputed. Trump is saying, ìShow me the bodies. There arenít 3,000 people that have died.îìHouse Speaker Ryan Does Not Dispute Puerto Rico Death Toll ó U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday he had ëno reasoní to dispute Puerto Ricoís official death toll of 3,000 from last yearís Hurricane MariaÖîWell, you want the Republicans to stay on offense, and hereís the Speaker of the House siding against Trump and with the media on a very important story about Trump believability and credibility. Then Jeb Bush has weighed in on Trumpís Puerto Rico tweets, calling them ìincredibly disheartening.î ìJeb Bush criticized Trumpís controversial tweets about the death toll in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.ìBush tweeted Thursday, ëIncredibly disheartening comments from our president.'î Meanwhile, folks, George Washington University hasnít counted any 3,000 dead bodies. Nobodyís been to the morgue. Nobodyís been to the funeral homes. These are estimates. These are guesstimates based on computer models comparing previous storms. Trump said when he left Puerto Rico the guys that run the country said maximum 16 people had died. Shortly after, the count becomes 3,000, 2,975, something like that. So whatís your reaction to that, Nick? You want íem to go on offense, but it seems like the Republican establishment doesnít want to help Trump out in this particular fight.CALLER: Well, I appreciate that, and my thought when you were speaking through that was Paul Ryan was on the same ticket as Mitt Romney, who didnít go on offense and lost, and Jeb spent $130 million for an exclamation point. So óRUSH: No, he spent $100 million for three delegates. They looked like an exclamation point, but I can see why youíd think that. Yeah.CALLER: But he was on defense the whole time, and he got three delegates. Trump got over 300 Electoral College votes, and so thatís my point. Trump went on offense, and he won. Trumpís offense is whatís gonna get voters to turn out. So if the Republicans sit back and do nothing, then I just really think óRUSH: Do you think they want to hold the House?CALLER: (chuckles) I think, uhÖ I think that they do. I think that their mind-set on how to doÖ I donít think they want to fight. I think they want to hold the House by not fighting, and thatís not true of all of them. President Trumpís the exception to what I was talking about, but in Congress, like, I think they want to, but if they have to go fight and put up with the media? I donít think many people can stomach in the House what Trump has to put up with every single day.RUSH: Thereís noÖ Itís not just the House. Thereís nobody in the country who could put up with it. Nobody.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, folks, this blue wave, red wave is all moot anyway. CNN called the election yesterday. Some of you may not have been with us, but it was breaking news. CNN announced that the Democrats were gonna win the House because of a poll theyíve got. They have a generic poll out that shows the Democrats lead by 10. Itís a poll of likely voters. CNN pointed out the Republicans do their best in likely voter polls, and theyíre down 10; so effectively the November elections are over. CNN has called it.The Democrats will win. We did that. (interruption) You were traveling back. You didnít hear this yesterday. We broke into regular scheduled programming two or three times to announce this yesterday. CNN has called the November elections. The Democrats have won, based on polling data. Theyíre not even waiting for the exit polls. (laughing) Theyíre just using pre-election polls?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Mr. Snerdley was not here yesterday, and I justÖ He was staring at me with disbelief when I mentioned that we had to interrupt the program four different times yesterday with breaking news that CNN has already called the November elections for the Democrats. Here is how it happened yesterdayÖKING: A brand-new poll out today, as we approach 50 days to the midterm elections, to show it is now increasingly likely the Democrats will take control of the House. What are the numbers to back that up? This. The first time weíre using likely voters in our CNN polling. A 10-point advantage for the Democrats when voters are asked which party do you want to run the Congress? Which party will you vote for come November? 52 to 42, the Democrats with a 10-point edge among likely voters. Likely voters tend to move Republicansí way. Not in this poll. A 10-point edge for the Democrats here. If this is the case on Election Day, the math tells you Democrats will take back the House.RUSH: There it is, and they ran with it all day yesterday that the Democrats win. Itís effectively over because of their poll. I did not take the time to refute the poll. A generic poll is rendered meaningless when you start adding names to it. When there are individual races, then peopleís opinions change dramatically. By the way, how hard would it be for an outfit like CNN to find a sample of 52% Democrats and 42% Republicans? But, anyway, this is a sign of the cocksure arrogance and the overconfidence ó and maybe even a little bit of the hope ó that they have invested. "

Hillary Clinton went out the other day in an interview with Christiane Amanpour and pretty much admitted everything I have been trying to warn people of about the American left and the Democrat Party! She went out and in her best Maxine Waters impersonation. She was encouraging people to be uncivil, and she was saying that it was justified being uncivil, given the opposition, the Republicans.And, if they win the House, then they can go back to being civil. If they win the Senate, then they can return to civility. I mean, theyíre making the case, theyíre proving the point, and there isnítÖ I donít see in all of thisÖ In all of this crazy, deranged, unhinged behavior of left-wing activists, I havenít heard one elected Democrat denounce it. I havenít heard one elected Democrat attempt to distance himself or herself or the party from it.I havenít heard one elected Democrat suggest to these deranged protesters to dial it back. I havenít heard one. They are all encouraging it. My point is: This is who they all are ó and with Hillary Clinton now advocating this incivility. What did I tell you yesterday? Weíre not in a battle of ideas anymore. Weíre not in an argument over ideas. They donítÖ Theyíre not even looking at any of this as about ideas.They see America today as flawed and illegitimate and, therefore, in need of a new set of defining values that will serve to unify the people who want to be part of America. Not anything to do with our founding. Not the Constitution. Not the Declaration. Thatís out the window ícause all thatís tainted. All of that was written by a bunch of privileged white guys who were setting up a system for themselves and their families and their descendants.And they didnít care about minorities. And they didnít care about transgenders. Where did I seeÖ? Some state. Iíve got it in the Stack. Iíll have to find it. Some state, on birth certificates, is now going to offer a third option, a third gender option on the birth certificate. Theyíre crazy! Theyíre literally nuts! They are at war with science! Theyíre at war with biology! Theyíre at war with physics! And they are at war with common sense. Hillary Clinton is not helping them with any of this.Itís okay to be uncivil.Itís okay to claw at the doors of the Supreme Court and try to get in to stop the swearing-in ceremony of Brett Kavanaugh.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I mentioned this at the beginning of the program. Hillary Rodham Clinton did a TV interview with her bud, Christiane Amanpour, on CNN yesterday, and Hillary Clinton said that this is a time for incivility.This is a time for people to be mean and rude and violent against Republicans! This is a time for it! And the time for this incivility to end will be when the Democrats take back the House or the Senate. Hillary Clinton discussed President Trump, the Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh, and civility in politics with Christiane Amanpour on CNN. Amanpour said, ìLast nightÖî This happened yesterday.ìPresident Trump had a sort of ceremony for now Justice Kavanaugh at the White House., and apologized on behalf the American people for the immense amount of pain and harm that he said that the judge had been put through by this system. What do you make of that and what message, including the presidentís mocking of Christine Blasey Ford for her allegations, what message does that send to women? And remember, went for President Trump in 2016.îHillary said, ìWhite women.îAmanpour: (paraphrased) ìYes, thatís right. White women! I forgot. White women. We donít like white women, right, Hillary?î(Hillary impression) ìThatís right; we donít, even though I am one.ìWhite women. All women went for me. White women went for Trump. And look, White women have been voting against Democratic presidential candidates for decades now. The White vote has only then won twice in the last 60 years. My husband being one of the two. Lyndon Johnson being the other. So, itís not a surprise. Itís a disappointment but itís not a surprise.î (translated) Itís a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me, but it is what it is.And therein Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved into a truth. Except for the very exceptional election year of 1964, which was following the JFK assassination, the Democrats have not gotten more than 50% of the white vote in a presidential election since 1932. Now, when you look at it that way, you can understand why in Democrat Party circles thereís hatred for ìwhite people.î White people, white women, have been rejecting them. White, married suburban women have been rejecting them.This is why the feminazi movement sprang up. This is why the left has started concocting all different categories for nonwhite suburban women to be plugged into so that they can then be said to be Democrat constituents. And, by the way, this is, again, why in 1965 Ted Kennedy and the Democrats reopened the floodgates to immigration. I need to remind everybody again from about 1921 to 1923 through 1965 we shut down immigration. Not to zero. But we put very strict limits on it.The reason was to be able to assimilate all of the immigrants that had come into the country the late 1800s through the 19, early twenties. Assimilation was key to American immigration policy. Arriving immigrants all wanted to be citizens, by the way. And there were things they had to do to become citizens. They had to learn the language, and they had to learn the history of America, they had to be able to pass questions about the history of America on a test.And they had to swear and pledge their loyalty and devotion to the United States. And they were eager to do it. And they were happy to do it. Now, they maintained their ethnicity, the Irish, the Italians, you name it. But they wanted to become Americans. And they did. And it took a number of years to assimilate them all. Well, 1965 is when Ted Kennedy led the charge to reopen the immigration floodgates, which then, of course, led toÖOnce that happened, illegal immigration ramped up in an uncontrollable way. And that wave of immigrants starting in 1965 came from Third World socialist countries. The Democrats realized they could only win the White House if they changed the population of America. They were losing presidential elections with the Native American population because they were losing white women. And Mrs. Clinton just admitted it here to Christiane Amanpour of CNN.It never occurred to them to change their policies. What they had to do in order to attract white voters, what they had to do was change America. So back to Hillary. She said, ìWhat was done last night in the White House,î meaning Trump apologizing for the nation to Kavanaugh. ìWhat was done last night in the White House,î she said, ìwas a political rally. It further undermined the image and integrity of the court. And that troubles me greatly.îì[I]t saddens me, because our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government.î BS! The judicial system has been viewed by you as election insurance. The judicial system has been viewed by you and Mrs. Clinton, the rest of the Democrats as your private refuge. You have looked at the court as a place you can stock like-minded leftist activists to make sure things that you believe in which never could pass legislation somehow become law in America.Thatís why they want the courts. If you want to really get frustrated, and youíve heard me say this, and you probably heard a lot of other people, but stop and think about this. Outside of Obamacare, practically every liberal mistake, every liberal idea and belief that now is the law in this country would not have become law in Congress because it never would have passed. Liberalism and the Democrat Partyís ideas have never been mass popular.The only way that we have bastardized pop culture laws and reality today is because Democrat activist judges have been essentially writing law when they take cases and interpret them and then pronounce decisions. Roe v. Wade is the most sterling example of this. But there are countless others. The simple fact of the matter is, the Democrat Party has never been capable of winning legislation to implement the ideas they believe in because most of the American people, when they know whatís at stake, donít want them.Thatís the value of judges, thatís the value of courts to the Democrats, when Mrs. Clinton says that what happened in the White House the other night ìsaddensî her ìbecause our judicial system has been viewed as one of the main pillars of our constitutional government.î BS. Not by you. In fact, to Hillary Clinton and people like her, the Constitutionís an obstacle as well! Itís certainly not something to revere.Christiane Amanpour: ì[D]o you see any wayÖ? Even a conservative who I was speaking of yesterday said the only way to repair America is try to get back to some civility and to try to make it that even if we have political disagreements, weíre not going to war with each other; weíre not trying to destroy each other.î Hillary Clinton: ìWell, certainly I would love to see us return to civility,îChristiane Amanpour: ìListening to one another, working out our differences. That is not the Republican Party that exists today, and that is certainly not the administration that we have in power right now. When the Republican Senate denied the right of President Obama to have his nominee for the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland,î and we are we go off to the races again mischaracterizing that. Blue in the face. Thatís a Joe Biden rule! The Democrats invented that rule that presidents donít get to name Supreme Court justices during vacancies that happened in the last year of their term.Thatís a Democrat-instituted rule, and she knows it. But the Republicans didnít destroy Merrick Garland. The Democrats didnít have to fight battles defending his character and his life because the Republicans were not trying to destroy him, as they did Kavanaugh. Anyway, the upshot of this is that Hillary Clinton says itís a time for incivility. It is a time for this kind of extremism because thatís what weíre up against. Steve Scalise, who was shot by one of the believers of Hillary Clinton at that Republican baseball practice, cannot believe it.Bill Cassidy, senator from Louisiana, responded to Hillary: ìAt a time when Republicans are being shot, stabbed, doxxed, beaten, mailed powder, run out of restaurants, and sent death threats, Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to be even more uncivil. What an irresponsible statement. Every Democrat should denounce.î Theyíre not gonna denounce her. They privately, publicly encourage her. They applaud it. They support it. That is who they are.This is the party, by the way, that has been railing against all this incivility for I donít know how long. This is whyÖ I look at average American voters paying attention to this, and I donít understand how any of them can want to side with what the Democrat Party is doing, how theyíre doing it. I know it happens, but itís a mystery to me. My hope is, my faith is that this incivility, this insanity, this unhinged Democrat behavior is negatively impacting the Democrats. That the Kavanaugh effect, pro-RepublicanÖI know thatís real. The polling data indicates that thatís real if you want to believe polling data. But weíre never gonna get a poll of people who disapprove of Democrat Party tactics and techniques. That poll is never gonna be run. And if they did, if somebody on the left did run that poll and the results came back that it was quite harmful to the Democrats, they wouldnít run the results.They would get hold of Democrat leaders, the media would, say, ìLook. This is not working, you guys. You better get hold of your people and dial íem back.î The problem is the Democrats canít dial these people back. The Democrats donít control these left-wing radicals. Thatís why you donít see any public statements of disapproval.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I mentioned this at the beginning of the program. Hillary Rodham Clinton did a TV interview with her bud, Christiane Amanpour, on CNN yesterday, and Hillary Clinton said that this is a time for incivility.This is a time for people to be mean and rude and violent against Republicans! This is a time for it! And the time for this incivility to end will be when the Democrats take back the House or the Senate. Hillary Clinton discussed President Trump, the Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh, and civility in politics with Christiane Amanpour on CNN. Amanpour said, ìLast nightÖî This happened yesterday.ìPresident Trump had a sort of ceremony for now Justice Kavanaugh at the White House., and apologized on behalf the American people for the immense amount of pain and harm that he said that the judge had been put through by this system. What do you make of that and what message, including the presidentís mocking of Christine Blasey Ford for her allegations, what message does that send to women? And remember, went for President Trump in 2016.îHillary said, ìWhite women.îAmanpour: (paraphrased) ìYes, thatís right. White women! I forgot. White women. We donít like white women, right, Hillary?î(Hillary impression) Thatís right; we donít, even though I am one.Quote: ìWhite women. All women went for me. White women went for Trump. And look, White women have been voting against Democratic presidential candidates for decades now. The White vote has only then won twice in the last 60 years. My husband being one of the two. Lyndon Johnson being the other. So, itís not a surprise. Itís a disappointment but itís not a surprise.î (translated) Itís a disappointment that white women vote Republican and not for me, but it is what it is.And therein Hillary Clinton stumbled and swerved into a truth. Except for the very exceptional election year of 1964, which was following the JFK assassination, the Democrats have not gotten more than 50% of the white vote in a presidential election since 1932.

They canít stand that Trump is succeeding; they canít stand these Trump rallies. Theyíre convinced that half the country hates Trump as they do.

Sure it would. If thatís the standard. If the party that you oppose is destroying your way of life, then you must be uncivil against the it. But (sigh) ó and you know this ó in the Hillary Clinton Democrat Party world, our world should be destroyed. That is justice. That is whatís called for: Conservatism, Republicans being destroyed. That is the new morality. And we have no business fighting back or resisting it. We deserve what we get.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Hereís Ken in Oklahoma City. We head back to the phones.

(laughing) Hey, my point is today, with Hillaryís comments that basically liberals donít need to be civil to conservatives anymore, it reminded me of a profound quote I came across years ago and maybe even you said it. But hereís the quote: ìA society is either moving toward civility or barbarism. And I see Trump trying to apply civil law and order to our society. And itís apparent that the liberal left is embracing barbarism again.î Just wanted to get your thoughts.RUSH: So, but the question is, do I agree that our society is always trending toward barbarismÖ Barbarism and what?CALLER: A society óRUSH: Barbarism or civility. Weíre trending one way. Weíre not in the middle of the two. Weíre either trending toward civility or barbarism.CALLER: In constant flux.RUSH: And theÖ Oh, itís a constant flux. And so what, what is your question where Trump is in it?CALLER: Well, it seems as if the Republican conservatives are taking the side of civility and working, you know, towards law and order or restoring it, and it seems like the Democrats have just outright embraced barbarism.RUSH: Right.CALLER: With all of their character assassination attempts on Trump and Kavanaugh, the Antifa violence, shootings óRUSH: Yeah, thereís no question about, itís an active choice.

My point is the Democrat Party hasnít changed that much, is my point. The Democrat Party has always been rooted in the modern era, in our lifetimes, in this century and the previous century, the Democrat Party has been rooted in anti-capitalism, has been rooted in pro-socialism and Big Government. Theyíve just now abandoned any pretense of moderation about that and have gone all-in on militant and violent socialism to achieve their means. My point, theyíre not that different. Theyíre just masking less today.  "

Youíre so right, so often, itís scary, and youíve convinced me that the left is right. Rush, I have to confess. My son, Eddie, came out of the womb peeing all over everybody, female doctor, nurses, even his own mother. Sure enough, my son appears to be growing up to be a white guy. See? What you say is true. The white patriarchal power structure at work.îI love these satirical reactions. Thatís what the left is asking everybody to believe. Folks, Iím telling you, these kids that have now become adults, that maintain this adolescent degree of rage, psychological disorders and what have you, they have been taught this stuff, and they really have been taught that the founding of America was one of the greatest injustices in all of humanity. And anybody other than white men are victims. And if you are a white woman happily in a relationship with a white man, then youíre part of the sellout, youíre part of the problem, youíre letting everybody down.You are subordinating yourself to patriarchy for the benefits that you get. You get a relationship, you get an income, you get a nice house, you get a family, and so you are a sellout. And Iím not exaggerating! This is what theyíre teaching! And this is what these young people believe! Go to the audio sound bites. Weíve talked about this woman before, Rebecca Traister. She was on C-SPAN2 on Saturday, Saturday night, a show called After Words. What is thisÖ She was running for attorney general or is an attorney general, and she said something outrageously stupid that we highlighted here and Iíve forgotten what it is.But itís in the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez vein. And itís just asinine stupid. I wish I could remember it. Itís in our show archives. But this the firstÖI think maybe weíve got a sound bite of her before, but this is an appearance about a book that she has written called, Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Womenís Anger. And the host of this C-SPAN After Words show is Rutgers University womenís and gender studies professor Brittney Cooper.Question: ìIt feels devastating to me that if white woman cannot have a public life, private life, professional life or in protest then what are we to do?î Let me read that question again. ìIt feels devastating to me that if white woman cannot have a public life, private life, professional life or in protest then what are we to do?î And here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca TraisterÖTRAISTER: Are we angry that it has to be white women before we take these stories seriously? Or, or, I think itís ìand,î do we all acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and if their power, their proximal power can be useful in revealing the degree to which women are still oppressed than in fact is this strategically necessary? And this goes back to the question: ìDo we need white women?î Thatís an electoral question that every candidate needs ask.RUSH: ìItís an electoral question that every candidate needs to ask Ö ëDo we need white women?íî Now, this wouldnít be happening if it hadnít been for the realization that a lot of white women supported Kavanaugh. And I donít know if it was so much that white women supported Kavanaugh as that they were scared to death at what they saw being set up against men. They have sons. They have brothers.And anybody with half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind to see that the Democrat Party had aligned itself in such a way that men were automatically guilty simply because they exist! Simply because they are capable! In fact, letís see. Thereís actually a story with that exact point made here. And I think I moved it to the bottom of the Stack. But it is a woman making the point that Kavanaugh is as good as guilty because he could have done it!And he could have done it because heís a man. He could have done it because he has male genitalia. Thatís all this woman in this story requires to believe Blasey Ford, that Kavanaugh could have done it. Well, if youíre a woman with sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and youíre watching this, you wouldnít miss what is transpiring, that men are automatically guilty. All it takes is an allegation. The allegation doesnít require any evidence.In fact, the fact that thereís no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened, because thatís what men do, because men can, and men can because they have the genitalia necessary to do it. Well, if youíre an average, ordinary, decent woman watching this stuff, how in the world do you want to sign on to that? Well, you donít. And so now these leftist women are enraged when they have discovered that they failed to persuade a bunch of average, ordinary white women to join their cause, anti-Kavanaugh. So now these women are sellouts and their uteruses are sellouts and their wombs are sellouts and theyíre selling out to the patriarchy.And, as such, they become worthless and even a liability to the point now that here we have a sound bite with two women experts in gender studies saying, do we need white women? Itís an electoral question every candidate needs to ask. Let me remind you, in November of 2011, the Obama presidential campaign, was written about by Thomas Edsall in the Washington Post, might have been the New York Times, announced that they were forgoing the ìwhite working classî as a voting bloc and instead were going to put together a winning coalition of a sum total of every minority group they could find.They were gonna combine all these minority groups and make that the Democrat base because white working-class voters were becoming less and less dependable, because they werenít buying Obama and Obamacare, and because of that, they were becoming racist. The traditional Democrat little guy voting bloc, they expressed no interest. This is simply an evolution of that! So while the white working class was told to go pound sand by the Obama campaign in 2011, now in 2018 do we need white women? Itís an electoral question that every candidate needs to asking S. Folks, donít misunderstand what Iím doing here.Iím not doing this simply to express incredulity at this. Iím doing this under the auspices of how in the world can a majority or mainstream of Americans in any way support this party? I realize Iím setting myself up here for what may be a major shocking disappointment the day after the election in November. And Iím not making any predictions here. Iím genuinely curious. I just donít see how the actions, the words, the policies, the attempts to inspire and persuadeÖ I just donít see how any decent, normal people fall for this. I realize the Democrats have educated a lot of people in the last two generations. I realize a lot of college educated people have come out of these institutions, and they have been corrupted and polluted with this crap.And since most people are not what they wish they were, most people are not as successful as they want to be, most people do think about what they donít have rather than what they do. And if thatís who you are, if thatís the personality type, then itís not very big step to start blaming somebody else for what you donít have. Becomes very easy to blame some faceless patriarchy, some faceless white privilege power structure, some faceless bunch of meanies depriving you, denying you, discriminating against you.So all the left has to do is get a hold of people who have not amounted to what they want to amount to, donít have what they had hoped to have, in any way, materially, professionally, you name it. In other words, itís not hard to run into unhappy people. Itís not challenging to find a bunch of people that are beating themselves up. And all you have to do is convince those people that somebody else did it to íem, the Republicans, the white privilege power structure did it to íem. And thereís only one way to fix it, and thatís to wipe íem out.I know theyíve educated a lot of people who believe this now.  "

No. Susan Collins was not the turning point. Susan Collinsí speech didnít change any votes, but she did something far more important. The votes were already cast by the time she gave her speech on Friday afternoon. She did something far more important than that, which weíll discuss as the program unfolds.Now, what turned this was Trump. Trump in his rally where he was accused of ìmockingî Dr. Ford. He didnít mock Dr. Ford. He didnít imitate her. He didnít make fun of her. He simply repeated the truth of her testimony! She doesnít know who, what, when, where, why, she doesnít know how, she doesnít know when, she didnít know where it happened, what floor, second floor, what room, she didnít know any of that. The reason that was important is because nobody that reads the Drive-By Media knew any of that.In the hearings, Christine Fordís assertions were not challenged. So in the broad-based media coverage of the hearings, the fallacies and the unprovable allegations in her testimony were never brought up. So the average Joe Blow out there never knew that she couldnít identify where with it happened, when it happened, how she got home, who took her home, what happened afterwards. She couldnít even identify the year or the month.They didnít know this. They didnít know that everybody she placed in the room failed to corroborate what she said. The average Joe Blow reading the average Drive-By Media didnít know that until Donald Trump pointed it out. That was the turning point, and thatís why the media turned on Trump for this for mocking her because Trump gave up the ghost. Trump spilled the beans on what they were trying to hide in the rest of the Drive-By Media. And it was a turning point for public opinion. Make no mistake about that.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Donald Trump was on with Judge Jeanine Saturday night after his rally, and she asked him why he did that ó why did he call out the fallacy of her testimony ó and this is what the president saidÖTHE PRESIDENT: There were a lot of things happening that werenít correct, they werenít true, and there are a lot of things that were left unsaid.

Do not doubt me.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/05/its-undeniable-the-left-targets-white-men/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 5, 2018RUSH: Over the course of many recent months, I have made the point that one of the objectives of the modern American left is to transform America away from its intentions and its designs as founded. And in many ways, this was one of the agenda objectives of the Obama administration, although to do it in a stealth way. Obama couldnít come out and say it beyond that his policies were ìtransformative.î He couldnít define what that meant.There would have been a revolt ó and he wouldnít have been elected if heíd been honest about what transforming America meant. So what he claimed it meant was taking on issues like climate change and health care for everybody and all this, transform America. But what they really want to do is transform America away from our unique founding, convert it to a socialist democracy.Some of the radicals even want to go further and have this country become totally communist. In fact, thereís a poll out here today. This is from The Daily Caller. The poll is BuzzFeed news: ì31% of Millennials identify as Democratic socialists, according to a studyî that has been taken. You know, youíd like to not believe this. But the facts on the ground, just what you see ó even though it may be anecdotal evidence ó indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this.ìMillennial men were far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist than women. A total of 40% responded affirmatively to the question.î Now, how in the hell can that be? ëCause thereís one thing ó something doesnít just jibe with socialism. You know what it is? Self-reliance! Self-reliance, taking yourself seriously, standing up for yourself, believing in yourself, relying on yourself. Being a man just does not jibe with socialism.Socialism does not work well with self-reliant people. Socialism and communism attempt to erase self-reliant people. Self-reliant people ó people that do not need, do not depend on anybody but themselves, their immediate circle ó are huge threats to socialists and communists. So how in the hell has this happened? How is it 40% of Millennial men have become socialists, more than women? It ought to be the exact opposite.Well, hello, modern era feminism, which has had as one of its targets the demasculinization of men. And theyíve been very open and honest about that. Theyíve even conjured up terms for it: ìtoxic masculinity,î ìdangerous masculinity.î They are doing their best to erase natural male characteristics from as many young guys as they can, and since guys want to pal around with women within whatever women want is what men end up doing, on balance.I mean, you have individual exceptions, of course. You got Clint Eastwoods or youíve got James Caans that tell everybody to go to hell when theyíre told how to live and how to act. But, on balance, men do what women want íem to do. If a big book is famous and hot and women dig it, men are gonna go say theyíre reading it or try to become conversant in it. Itís just the nature of things. So theyíre being highly, highly successful ó and itís targeting America and its founding.Iím not just targeting capitalism. Theyíre targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting the concept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most in a representative republic. The de-emphasis of government, the getting government out of peopleís lives. Itís just the exact opposite with communists and socialists. So I have an evidence piece here. Not just flapping my gums.Thereís a New Yorker story by Michael Lista, a guy, published yesterday. ìThe Tears of Brett Kavanaughî is its title. It is a horrible piece, and it does exactly that which I have been warning people. It goes all the way back to the founding of America to trash ìwhite men.î Oh, that reminds me. Hang on here. You need to grab an audio sound bite here. Itís (muttering) 6 and 7. Pull quote: ìKavanaugh has no avenue of appeal, though, except his own hurt feelings. He is in touch with them, as he was taught to be.ìAnd so heís seemingly weaponized crying, the way a little boy does when heís in trouble.î Another pull quote: ìBut Kavanaughís performance last Thursday was something entirely different, distinctly contemporary. It combined the postwar attitude that men should be in touch with their feelings, to the point that they may cry, with the intrinsic American ideal of white male privilege.ìBecause Kavanaugh is accused of sexual assault, and may be denied the career elevation that he has long plotted, he blubbered like a newborn.î He has ìplottedî his career, you see? He hasnít had a series of goals and achieved them. Oh, no! The guy is a dangerous schemer. He has ìplottedî to get on the Supreme Court, where he can rule against minorities and women and Latinos and Hispanics and gays and lesbians and transgenders, donít you know?This has been the lifelong ìplottingî strategy of Brett Kavanaugh, and when there was the least bit resistance placed in his way, he was reduced to tears, started crying. And then this pull quote: ìKavanaughís ìtears make a kind of sense. From a single phrase by Thomas Jefferson ó that public life is about ëLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happinessí ó the fulfillment of the white American manís atomized desires assumed the force of a fiat, and became the ultimate purpose of this countryís society.ìIf a white man didnít get what he wanted, it was nothing short of a constitutional crisisÖî This is what this clown saw in the Kavanaugh hearings! But youíll notice the references here. ìFrom a single phrase by Thomas Jefferson ó that public life is about ëLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happinessí ó the fulfillment of the white American manís Ö desires assumed the force of a fiat,î meaning an automatic, ìand became the ultimate purpose of this countryís society.ìIf a white man didnít get what he wanted, it was nothing short of a constitutional crisisÖî Bingo! These people prove me right each and every time I go analyzing them. So the trouble with America is that it was established by white men for white men and the pursuit of happiness and life and liberty was only intended for white men ó and if any white man was obstructed in the pursuit, then there was something wrong with America.Do not minimize this. Iím telling you, this belief is animating the last two generations, informing the last two generations of kids going to high school and college. This is the kind of drivel that they are being taught, that America is corrupt from its founding days, that it was founded for an exclusive group of people: White men. Nobody else need apply.And when they donít get their way ó in other words, when minorities start taking over. Latinos, lesbians, gays, transgenders, you name it. When those people start taking over, thatís justice. When white men have their lunch handed to íem and have to listen to what their pursuit of happiness has meant for everybody else: Misery, death, destruction, discrimination. This is what this sick bunch of people believe!Go to the audio sound bites. More documentation. Last night on CNN Tonight with Don Lemon talking about the protests against the Kavanaugh nomination and your beloved host, meÖLEMON: Thereís a (pause) not-at-all subtle undercurrent to all of this. This is not just an attack on conservatives. Itís an attack on white men. Rush Limbaugh, come on down!RUSH ARCHIVE: These women are angry. Something has happened to them in their lives ó and their rage and anger, they take it out now on the country or on all men or men in ìthe powerful majority,î which is white Christian men and so forth.LEMON: Hmph! He said it. So donít get mad at me and say (high-pitched voice), ìOoh, Don Lemon, everythingís about race!î Rather than searching for the truth, the president and his party, theyíre appealing to their base, people who feel ó feel ó victimized, who fear the world is passing them by. Feel. Fear. People who see all of this as a zero-sum game. If women or people of color or LGBT advance, it must be at someone elseís expense.RUSH: No, no, no, Don. Thatís what you people are doing. Iím merely chronicling whatís happening out there. It is undeniable. I just shared with you one of countless examples I could cite. This guy Michael Lista in The New Yorker suggesting that Kavanaughís crying because heís a white man targeted, singled out for advancement in America by other white men, and when itís not going his way he breaks down and cries.This piece justifies the attack on white men! It says itís about time. The whole country ó the assault on the whole country is validated because itís actually an assault on a white male majority which has caused tyranny and sadness and misery and death and destruction for everybody else! All I said was, ìThese women are angry.î The #MeToo movement.ìThese women are angry. Something has happened to them Ö their rage and anger, they take it out now on the country Ö ëthe powerful majority,í which is white Christian menÖî Thatís the target. You canít deny that white Christian men or just white men period are the target of modern feminism, of modern American liberalism and the American left. Somehow, Don Lemon converts this into a racial issue. It isnít race.Weíre talking about the structure of America as founded and whatís to become of it, and the justification the left sees for getting rid of it and transforming it! He wants everything to be about race. There was no racial component in my comment at all. Iím simply identifying the targets today of the American left. See how easy it is for me to make my case here? They help me. They make my case for me. All I have to do is read to you what they say or play audio of what they say.  "

Wage growth has hit a 17-month high. Job growth has hit a seven-month high. The stock market has hit another record high. One-hundred-and-two record highs during the Trump presidency. Service industry growth, Mr. Limbaugh, has hit another record high ó and trade deals recently negotiated by Trump are helping everybody, particularly farmers.ìMy question, Mr. Limbaugh, is do people feel this and know why itís happening? Does anybody know this is happening? The media isnít talking about it. Trump is doing all of this. Does anybody know it?î Good question. Good. Question. The economy is perking along at a rate Obama never envisioned. In fact, Obama told everybody this couldnít happen! The Democrats and Obama told everybody it couldnít happen. In the politics of yesterday, this would be all Trump needed to survive and withstand anything.Itís why the media is not reporting it. CNBC has the details. ìëRip-Roaring Hotí Jobs Market Sees Private Payrolls Surge by 230,000, Highest Since February.î Itís ìwell ahead of expectations.î The experts predicted 185,000. ìMoodyís economist Mark Zandi said the current pace suggests an unemployment rate of close to 3% in a year.î So all the economic news is out of this world, and itís because of the Trump presidency! Itís because of the Trump agenda.The Democrats have told everybody this could not happen. In the midst of all of this, there are two new independent generic ballot polls out. The big one is Quinnipiac. ìQuinnipiac University poll shows the Democrat generic ballot lead has been cut in half in months. Itís gone from 12% to 7%,î basically 50%.The generic ballot lead, the Democrats are losing it. Even Frank Luntz is tweeting this out. Quinnipiac showing the Democrat generic ballot lead has been cut in half in a month. You know why? You know why? Kavanaugh. The experts are saying itís Kavanaugh. Itís a backlash to Kavanaugh, and thereís another story here about suburban women turning to Trump in droves because of Kavanaugh. Suburban women used to be a deadlock of the Democrat Party, college-educated suburban women.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/02/cnn-panic-senate-house-races-tightening/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 2, 2018RUSH: Greetings to you, music lovers, thrill-seekers, conversationalists all across the fruited plain. I am the famous and well-known Rush Limbaugh. Not ìright-wing radio talk host Rush Limbaugh;î just the famous and well-known Rush Limbaugh. And I have been doing this a long time. And that means I have a lot of perspective and I bring a lot of experience. And Iím going to share and apply it to practically everything we do today as I do each and every day.Greetings. Great to have you with us. If you want to be on the program, the telephone number is 800-282-2882. The email address, ElRushbo@eibnet.us. Could the pollsters once again have it all wrong? Could the pollsters be mistaken or could they be lying to us? That will be my focus for the initial parts of the program today.First, President Trump in Johnson City, Tennessee, a rally last night. Interestingly, none of the cable channels covered it wall-to-wall as they usually do, but thatís not a big deal. I had people sending me notes. ìFox isnít even covering it, Rush! Whatís up?î Doesnít matter. These are local events, folks. Theyíre local events. They are intendedÖ These Trump rallies are intended to influence local voting, local interest, local participation.ìCampaign Estimates 20,000 Trump Supporters at Massive Overflow Rally in Tennessee ó Trumpís new campaign manager Brad Parscale estimated that there were 20,000 people at the rally ó 7,000 inside the arena, 2,000 in the overflow room, and thousands outside. ëBig numbers!í he exclaimed on Twitter. Rep. Phil Roe of Tennessee said 92,000 had requested tickets to the event. Some supporters arrived Sunday night to stake their position in the line.î&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=îbookmarkî style=îdisplay: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;î class=îmce_SELRES_startî&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;<U+FEFF>&amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
Thatís like a new iPhone release!ìThe rally was held at the Freedom Hall Civic Center, with large screens set up by the campaign for the overflow crowd. ëWatching outside on the big screen with all these fine folks is still better than watching at home!!!í wrote one Trump supporterÖî Another tweeter wrote, ìëTrying to estimate precise crowd size was impossible on the ground, as the line snaked various ways up and down the hill, around the parking lots, etc. But Iíd still place it as enough to fill at least one and probably two more Freedom Halls.'îSo 92,000 tickets requested, 20,000 people in attendance in little Johnson City, Tennessee. Whatís going on here? How does that translate to any kind of a blue wave? Now, I realize itís Tennessee, maybe Trump country and so forth. But it does not suggest that thereís any lack of enthusiasm on the Republican side. Now, letís go to the audio sound bites, and weíre gonna start with audio sound bite No. 1 here. We have CNN sounding the alarm.House races are tightening! CNN says there could be a GOP wave in the Senate and that Kavanaugh is energizing Republicans. The show is CNNís Newsroom. The co-host, Jim Sciutto, was asking their senior politics writer, Harry Enten, about CNN polls on various Senate races that are within or close to the margin of error. The question: ìPolls are tightening out thereÖî No, the question was (impression), ìOh, my God! Oh, no. Oh-ho, no, Harry! The polls are tightening? (hyperventilating) Oh, my God. No! What does that tell you? (sputtering) What ó what ó whatís going on, Harry?îENTEN: There are so many races that are within the margin of error.SCIUTTO: Mmmph!ENTEN: Missouri, Nevada, Tennessee, Florida. The list go on his and on and on. We have all of these close races which means we have a best estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November, but it really could be a Democratic wave but or a Republican waves if the polls are off in one direction or óSCIUTTO: (shocked) Republican wave in the Senate ó in the House? (sputtering)ENTEN: In the Senate. Not in the House.RUSH: Republican wave in the Senate? Oh, no! That means no impeachment of Trump. Well, that means an impeachment if the Democrats get the House. Donít think so, but if they do, it would die in the Senate unless thereís a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there ícause they would never vote to convict if the Republicans hold the Senate or even swell the ranks. So the paniced host, Jim Sciutto, couldnít believe what he heard there, ìRed wave in the Senate?î He says, ìThere was discussion of a blue wave, big generic ballot advantage for Democrats. Do you notice a tightening there as we get closer to the election?îENTEN: I will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which óSCIUTTO: Oh!ENTEN: ó was actually good news for Republicans.RUSH: Oh, no!ENTEN: You know, thereís a lot of talk, ìOh, with Brett Kavanaugh and this whole confirmation mess that, in fact, that might hurt Republicans.î But it doesnít actually seem to be so far. Weíre actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and more than that weíre seeing tightening in the House races.RUSH: Iím gonna give you a little side observation about this. But what did I tell you? These generic ballots way back last December ó thatís when they first started harping on this. Back then, you know, nine months ago, the Democrats had a 12-point advantage, and thatís when all the talk of a blue wave began. And thatís when all the talk of the Democrats winning back Congress began. And it went all through the year. The Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was 12, five, seven; then the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them.The Democrats once again broke away. All during it, I, your host ó I have been doing it in a long time ó said, ìIt doesnít matter. It doesnít mean anything.î Let me remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England Patriots, one Bill Belichick. Prior to one of the Super Bowls the Patriots were inÖ They might do it frequently. I know of one time, he gathered the players for a team meeting and said, ìWeíre gonna have a little fun. Weíre gonna watch a horse race.îHe had videotape of a horse race that nobody had seen. It was not a big race. He was gonna allow the players to make friendly bets and wagers on who was gonna win. So the players made their bets, and Belichick starts the tape of the race and stops it at the first turn. He said, ìOkay, lay your bets. Tell me whoís gonna win.î Players go nuts making their choices. Tape resumes; Belichick stops it at the halfway point. ìAnybody want to change their bet? Anybody want to double down?îPlayers go into gear making their bets. At the final turn, Belichick stops the tape of the horse race again, asks the players if they want to make additional bets or get out of ones theyíve made. Players do what they do; Belichick resumes tape to the finish line. He makes the point, ìIt didnít matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape. Thereís no way anybody could have known ó at the first turn, at the halfway point, or at the final turn ó who was gonna win. Yet look what you were doing. You were making bets. You were guessing. Some of you probably were certain.ìThe bottom line is: Finish. You never know before itís over whoís going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you.î It was a motivation technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter, halftime, third quarter? Finish. Do your job. Same thing here. Polls in January in front of a November election doesnít mean anything. Polls in June/July donít mean anything. Theyíre interesting for the media which is trying to shape public with these polls, but the polls do not give any indication of the final outcome.A poll in July or August would not have contained any of the Kavanaugh news; so how relevant could it have been? Answer: None. Zilch, zero, nada. So now here we are on October 2nd, and CNN is panicking. Races are tightening in the House. This wasnít supposed to happen! Why, they had all their preelection polls. They had the generic ballot. Theyíve had this in the can. This has been in the bank since last December. In their minds, itís been over. Itís just a matter of letting the calendar play out.Now all of a sudden, House races are tightening, and there could be a red wave in the Senate. Red wave in the Senate! Republicans could come out of nowhere at the final turn and take over. Well, we donít know if the Republicans were ever really far behind. We donít know anything, because there wasnít a vote back in December or January or July or August! We donít know anything! And we donít know anything now. And we wonít know anything until the day after Election Day or maybe later that night. Now, one other brief observation here.Massive crowd for Trump rally in TN. CNN panics: Polls tightening, GOP wave in Senate? Races fighting in House? Polls donít matter right before the election. Kavanaugh smear falling apart, backfiring on Democrats. NYT prints story on Kavanaugh throwing ice at a bar in the 80s, never reported on Clinton telling Juanita Broaddrick to ìput ice on thatî after alleged rape. Rush encourages McConnell to take charge and he does, says vote by end of week. DiFI: Friday too soon to vote.OUT: been through inside out.Once again, do you notice Mr. Enten snuck it in there? ìYou know, thereís a lot of talk, ëOh, with Brett Kavanaugh and this whole confirmation mess that in fact that might hurt Republicans.'î It doesnít seem to be so far. Ladies and gentlemen, I am the reason heís saying this and everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if the Republicans donít confirm Kavanaugh that the Democrats are gonna win everything. That prediction of mine went viral. The Drive-Bys loved it!They love it when the leader of the GOP (in their minds, me) starts ripping the Republicans. When I start predicting them to lose, thatís when I become totally credible. Thatís when they run sound bites of me predicting it all over the world. You notice how easy it would be to trick them? They run with that and they run with it. Now all of a sudden, itís just the exact opposite! Itís just the exact opposite. (impression) ìWhy, all of this attention on Kavanaugh and what the Republicans are doing is actually gonna help íem? How can that be? Limbaugh just said they were gonna lose!îThey are totally, totally confused. As I said yesterday, ìWhat is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win?î You know, people say, ìWell, let Kavanaugh go down. That will really fire íem up! Thatíll fire everybody up.î No. The way you get on the bandwagon, the way you get people on the bandwagon, the way you get people wanting to be on your team is win, including winning the Kavanaugh nomination.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/01/trump-teaches-the-world-a-lesson-on-trade/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 1, 2018RUSH: The Drive-By Media, the legacy media, the mainstream media, the Democrat Party all said that it was not possible for economic growth to ever be above the best it was under Obama, which was 1.8 to 2%. Obama had one outlier quarter a little over three, but those were extraneous circumstances there. Obamaís GDP average 1.8 to 2% on the upside, and everybody said, ìIt canít possibly get any better than that, and itís foolish to think so. Itís a new day in America, and those days of rabid capitalistic economic growth are over.îJust like Obama and the media said the jobs that weíve lost, manufacturing, otherwise, would never, ever, be coming back. Obama goes out to Elkhart, Indiana, telling people in the campaign year of 2016 not to think of their jobs coming back, that Trumpís lying to them about it, asking (impression), ìWhatís he gonna do? Wave a magic wand? Whatís the policy? Howís he gonna do it? Ainít gonna happen! I donít want you all, uh, uh, with false hopes out there.îWell, we got an economic growth now sustained of 4.2% and climbing. The stock markets approaching a new record high because Donaldus Trump last night, the deadline that he had set. We have a new trade deal with Canada to be added into the deal already reached with Mexico. It is what gets rid of NAFTA, just as he said he would do, just as he promised on the campaign trail. The new name of this thing is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.Trump has been speaking about this for the last half hour outside the Oval Orifice, and heís in a fine, fine mood, as is everybody gathered there. It is a major, major achievement. Again, it is something that the Democrat opposition (which includes, of course, the media) all said could not happen. ìIt couldnít be done. It was a waste of time to try,î as they said, scratching their heads, ìWhy does Trump care about trade deals anyway?î And theyíve never understood the Trump voter caring about trade deals.Theyíve never understand the connection made and maintains with voters on trade.And itís not just NAFTA; itís any number of other things. Jared Kushner has come in for a lot of credit on this deal, which means heís gonna be in the crosshairs right along with Brett Kavanaugh, about whom we will get to in due course. But the NAFTA news is gonna be buried, which is one of the reasons why Trump is spending so much time talking about it, giving the Drive-By Media a tough time in ignoring it.But for Trump itís electoral politics in addition to making America great again, as he defines it, something he promised, something he claimed could be done, that would be done, and it has been done, and it is to the benefit of people that votedÖ Well, to the benefit of millions and millions of Americans in countless numbers of ways, and heís making sure that as many people as possible are made aware of this. It had to kill the Washington Post to write about this.Headline: ìCanada Agrees to Join Trade Accord with U.S. and Mexico, Sending New NAFTA Deal to Congress.î So weíre renegotiating NAFTA. CanadaÖ Canada, which said they wanted no part of it? They asked in at the last moment! ìHey, hey, donít forget us! Can we be part of this, too?î Trump said, ìCome on in.î A reporter just asked Trump, ìDoes this mean the end of tariffs?î Trump said (summarized), ìHell, no, it doesnít mean the end of tariffs.ìIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United States, weíre gonna slap tariffs on it. Remember how the Drive-Bys and the Democrats said that slapping tariffs on Chinese goods was gonna provoke the ChiComs? It couldnít possibly be good! It might mean the end of whatever arrangement weíre making with the North Koreans. It might destroy existing good relations with the ChiComs!Breaking news! ìChina to Cut Import Tariffs on Wide Range of Products. China [the ChiComs] will cut import tariffs on textile products and metals, including steel products, to 8.4% down from 11.5%, effective Nov. 1, the [ChiCom] finance ministry said on Sunday. Beijing has pledged to take steps to increase importsî that means products from us ìthis year amid rising tension with some of its biggest trading partners, such as the United States.îBottom line, Trump said he was gonna do X, Y, and Z and A, B, and C in trade, and if we started A, B, and C, I think heís pretty much closing in on C. He has rebuilt the economy, he has created new jobs; his economic policies have. The elimination of onerous regulations, which is an ongoing thing, continues to show vast benefits for every ordinary American who makes this country work. And itís something he said could be done that only he could do and in fact, he was the only one that thought it was necessary to do, and itís now done.Here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden. We have three sound bitesÖ.THE PRESIDENT: I have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made. Since NAFTAís adoption the United States racked up trade deficits totaling more than $2 trillion, and itís a much higher number than that. With Canada and Mexico it lost vast amounts of money and lost 4.1 million manufacturing jobs and one in four auto jobs. Itís about 25% of our auto jobs, even more than that. Throughout the campaign I promised to renegotiate NAFTA, and today we have kept that promise.RUSH: For the last half hour, the presidentÖ Maybe even longer than that, maybe 45 minutes. You know, an extended statement, he only recently started taking questions. Iíll tell you what Trump is doing here, which is something that Iíve long advocated. He wasnít just announcing the deal got done. He was teaching why it was important, including to the Drive-By Media, who, for the most part, are clueless, donít understand capitalism, think that itís a big, bad, meany.Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works and how the United States has been victimized over the course of many, many years because of American leadership believing, ìWell, you know, weíre the superior in the world. Weíre the richest. We can afford to take it in the shorts now and then if it promotes good relations with our allies,î and Trump stood up and said, ìThereís no reason we should have our back pockets picked.ìThereís no reason that we should just let people have whatever they want from our treasury. Thereís no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy. It doesnít mean because we are so much wealthier and powerful, that those who are not have dibs on what weíve produced. Those days are over. That way of thinking is over.îHe went through the whole process of explaining how trade works, why it is important, how the United States was getting the shaft. But more importantly, why it matters to ordinary, everyday people and their jobs and their careers, including farmers and a number of other type people about whom Washington thinks not very often and thinks very little. Itís been a masterful performance.There is no question that Trump not only knows what heís talking about, he is the architect of what heís talking about, and he can run rings around people in discussing the process and in discussing the substance and the details of this new agreement. It puts anybody else thatís ever tried this to shame. Everybody that has the chance to listen to this is gonna understand exactly why it was important what happened, why it happened, and why we benefit, and why thatís good.You know, teaching as well as announcing is fundamental. I believe thatís why the Republican Congress 1994 actually squandered its majority after a while, itís because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it. They made the fatal mistake of believing that the Republican victory in 1994 meant somehow that a majority of the country had overnight turned conservative. So when they began to announce this cut, that cut, this reform, that reform, a lot of people didnít know what they were talking about, got scared to death.That lesson has been learned by none other than Donaldus Trump. Hereís the next bite. Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us. This kind of thinking, we havenít seen. Weíve seen thinking, both parties, who believe that itís up to us to earn the respect of others. Itís up to us to show them that we donít intend them any harm. Itís up to us. And Trumpís turning this 180 degrees around, said itís a privilege to trade with us. Weíre the world economy. Weíre the future of the world economy. Weíre the future of the world freedom and liberty. The days of America as the worldís piggybank are over.THE PRESIDENT: This deal will also impose new standards requiring at least 75% of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets. Itís a privilege for them to do business with us, and Iím not talking about Mexico-Canada. Iím talking about everybody, everybody. Itís a privilege for China to do business with us. Itís a privilege for the European Union ó who has treated us very badly, but thatís coming along ó to do business with us. Japan, every country. Itís a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggybank.RUSH: Yeah. Itís a privilege to come in now ó and, as I say, folks, itís a new way of seeing ourselves and our country without the need to make excuses, without the need to apologize. We really havenít seen this. You know, you can see evidence and signs of this in our own culture of the achieved and the accomplished somehow feel the need to apologize for it or to downplay it, as some sort of new definition of humility, rather than having it used as a teachable moment, as something inspiring.As Trump points out, we want every country making their country great. We want every country putting their country first. We want everybody doing it that way. Thatís the whole point, for everybody to do better, but not by piggy banking the United States, by doing it on their own. These kinds of things are justÖ Theyíre foreign to the United Nations types, diplomatic types. Hereís the final bite. Donít forget who told you this was not possible. Do not forget. It was Barack Hussein O who said none of this could be done.THE PRESIDENT: If you remember, the previous administration said, ìWeíre not gonna have manufacturing jobs anymore,îî essentially. Weíre not gonna haveÖ? Weíre not gonna make things anymore?î ìNo.î Just the opposite. Weíre gonna be a manufacturing powerhouse and allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been offshored to the world because of unfair trade issues.RUSH: So there you have it. Itís not a sexy subject. NAFTA never was. I mean, it commanded a lot of attention. You know, it was very controversial when it was ratified in the early into the mid-1990s. But in terms of being a subject, if cable news announced theyíre gonna do two or three panels tonight on NAFTA due to the trade deal, theyíre not gonna have a lot of people tune in. Itís just wait of the world.So Trump is making sure with this extended event in the Rose Garden today that people get its importance. In terms of its importance as an election issue, itís crucial. It isÖ I wouldnít say crucial. But itís very important in terms of Trump being able to say to his voters, ìStick with me. I told you I was gonna do this. I told you it could be done, and I told you the United States was gonna come out as the champion in the subject of world trade. Donít doubt me.îAnd, in that sense, itís confidence-inspiring that Trump ó left alone in the Oval Office, free and in charge to be who he is ó will mean a bunch of great things happening for the country. This can be parlayed into any number of campaign ads for the upcoming midterms, because itís gonna be about a lot of things, not just the Kavanaugh nomination and other things. This is gonna be a fundamental aspect in terms of turning out the Trump base.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/28/democrats-couldve-called-the-fbi-in-july/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 28, 2018RUSH: So I just checked out the Senate Judiciary Committee session here before they vote ó less than an hour, supposedly. Cory Booker, Democrat ó ìSenator Spartacusî from New Jersey ó is going on and on and on. ìThis is not partisan! This is not a partisan thing, Senator.î Heís talking to the chairman, Grassley. Not a partisan thing? Everything they do is politicized and partisan. It is precisely that. He talked about the heroism of Dr. Ford coming forward. Heroism? The way Dr. Fordís appearance is describedÖìShe was so helpful, they said. She was so cooperative, and she was so nice and so thoughtful, and she admitted to being terrified! She was so terrified she didnít know what ëexculpatoryí meant.î None of that matters! None of that matters. At the end of the day, this is about evidence. If youíre gonna destroy somebodyís life, you better have the goods, and they donít ó and neither did Dr. Ford. She canít tell íem where; she canít tell íem when. The people she says were there all swear under oath that they were not there, and yet this goes on.And yet Booker is still trying to say that this is not partisan. He just compared it to Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill. He said, ìThat was a blemish but even they had investigations. Even that committee took time to do the investigation! Weíre not even doing the investigation. We wonít even call the FBI.î This is driving people nuts. They had that letter in the middle of July! They could have done anything they wanted between then and now.They chose not to. When certain elements of her story were investigated, as was revealed yesterday, not a single Democrat member of the committee showed up to participate in it, because this is not about evidence. Once again, theyíre trying to take a Democrat activist, a professor, and turn her into an abused average American citizen and attach labels such as ìheroineî and ìbraveî and ìcourageous,î and it all happens under the premise that her allegations are not challengeable. You cannot question her.ìShe says it happened.î Thatís the basis under which weíre operating: It happened. And if you refuse, youíre the bad guy. Youíre the racist or bigot or sexist or whatever the Democrats want to throw at you. Dianne Feinstein had the letter from Dr. Ford. What did she do with it? She recommended Dr. Ford get a couple lawyers. (impression) ìLawyers? Uhhh, donít they cost moneeeeey?î DiFi said,î Donít worry about that. Weíve got you covered,î and she called a couple of Democrat activist lawyers, Katz and Bromwich, who then took the case pro bono so that Ford would not have to sell either her house in Santa Cruz or Palo Alto, or would not have to fly coach on her next trip to Hawaii.But she couldnít turn that information over to the FBI. She called a couple of hack activist lawyers and told them what happened to Ford or what Ford said happened, but she couldnít call the FBI, Dianne Feinstein. She didnít alert the rest of the committee that she had the letter. She just called a couple of lawyers. The Washington Post did not believe Blasey either. They were contacted first. She sent the letter (probably under advice to somebody) to their tip line, the Washington Post tip line.They never got back to her because they didnít believe it, and they wanted to believe anything! Now, when the Washington Post didnít believe it, it doesnít mean they didnít believe her story. What it means is the Washington Post looked at what her claim was and thought it was not useful in getting rid of Kavanaugh. That was the studied reaction by left-wing activists disguised as journalists at the Washington Post. If Dr. Fordís tip had been presented in a way that made the Washington Post think it would be useful in getting rid of Kavanaugh, then they would have scarfed it up.But they didnít. And again, not because they didnít think she wasnít credible or not because theyÖ Itís just something about it, Iím convinced, did not turn them on. But they were contacted first, and it was after that when the Washington Post didnít reply that someone said, ìOkay, well, letís go to the New York Times.î They didnít call the FBI. They didnít call Montgomery County police. They sent a letter to Feinstein. Feinstein goes out, hires a couple of hack lawyers who then start marshaling forces with the media.Throughout all of this, nobody calls the FBI to demand an investigation, ícause Iíll guarantee you they didnít believe it, or it wasnít detailed enough, or it didnít have what they really wanted ó and that is, a way of using it to get rid of Kavanaugh. I guess the pubic hair on the Coke can version of Fordís story didnít match the intensity of the pubic hair on the Coke can in the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill story. And nobody wants to frustrate Trump and his Supreme Court nominees more than the Washington Post.Now, I guess in some ways it takes a lot of courage to accuse somebody of attempted rape and even attempted murder. She said she feared for her life at one point! It might take a lot of courage to accuse somebody of that when you donít have a shred of evidence! That would scare the hell out of me! Letís just set the table here. Letís say that I am a Republican political activist and I sent a letter off to some Republican bigwigs, and they come to me, and they say, ìOkay. You say this happened to you, but you canít tell us where or when.ìYou canít really say who, not for sure? Well, we want you to go before one of our committees, and we want you to testify what happened to you, even though you canít say where it happened or when.î And Iím saying, ìYouíre asking meÖ? IÖî Boy, that would take a lot of courage, if youíre asking me. It would take a lot of courage to go tell a story with a whole lot of holes in it. So I guess on that basis we could grant that there was some courage involved. When you donít have a shred of evidence, not even the details of time and place? You got no witnesses, nothing.So, yeah, might take some kind of courage to try to destroy somebody without any corroboration. It might take some courage to try to join in the effort to destroy a life and a career. As was said over and over and over again yesterday, the FBI will only interview the same people who have already been interviewed. The FBI would then hand over the same interviews to the Senate. The Senate would just be back where they were before. The FBI doesnít reach conclusions exceptÖ What is it thatís percolating in my memory?Oh, yeah. The FBI did reach conclusions! The FBIÖ Iím sorry. James Comey and Strzok Smirk and McCabe, they reached a conclusion that Hillary was innocent. But they did that before examining the evidence. They did that before even interviewing Hillary. Hillary Clinton was exonerated of all crimes before they even interviewed her about her suspicious server and trafficking in classified data and documents. So whereas the FBI might not reach conclusions, we can point to FBI leadership having done so in order to clear Hillary Clinton.But in the normal scope of things, they donít. People making this claim are absolutely right.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal just asked (paraphrased), ìIn good conscience, Mr. Chairman, you delay this vote. We cannot do this in the United States Senate without an FBI investigation. Please delay the vote!î Heís still begging. Heís still asking.  "

In no particular order here, earlier on in the day Dr. Ford kept referring to her ìbeach friend.î I said, ìWhat the hell is a ëbeach friendí?î Her beach friends told her to do this, her beach friends told her to get the Washington Post, beach friends sent her to the New York Times, beach friends said get a lawyer, beach friends said, ìDonít pay for it yourself.îIt turns out that ìbeach friendsî are her buddies in Santa Cruz, California. This woman who canít afford to pay lawyers has a home in Santa Cruz, California, and a home in Palo Alto, California. Those are two of the most highly expensive real estate areas in the country, not just California. If you live in Santa Cruz, your buddies are beach buddies. You are beach friends. Santa Cruz is the most radical left community in the country, maybe a smidgen. And if it isnít, it is. And everybody there is political active radical left!It has now become clear to me what the Republican prosecutor is attempting to do here! The Republican prosecutor asking questions of Dr. Ford instead of Republican senators is attempting to establish that Christine Ford has come forward because the Democrat Party has brought her forward. She is attempting to establish that sheís not who she says she is. I mean, it may have happened. But that all of this is happening because the Democrat Party is behind it. Democrat Party political operatives and hacks are behind this! Thatís what the prosecutor is attempting to establish.People say, ìWhat does this matter who paid for your lawyers?î Itís part of the attempt to establishÖ Remember who the audience for this is. The audience for this is a couple or three Republican senators, folks, not you and me. Well, you and me in a sense, but in trying to establish that all of this is not an aggrieved woman who because of her heart and her conscience has come forward. Sheís being dragged forward and put in the public eye by the Democrat Party who may have instigated this from the get-go!Thatís the attempt that is being made. Whether itís effective yet or not, I donít know. But I think that is one of the objectives, shall we say, of the woman conducting the interrogation or the interviews of Dr. Ford for Republican senators. Now, both of her lawyers that we see hereÖ Sheís got four. There are two prominently on display here, Michael Bromwich and the Soros lawyer. That would be Debra Katz. Anyway, they just admitted that they are both working pro bono.This woman has the money to pay them, but theyíre working pro bono, and Bromwich ó are you ready for it? ó is also Andrew McCabeís lawyer! So this guy, one way or the other, is determined to frustrate Donald Trump, to get Trump, one way or the other. Now, I personally ó as a man of great decency and compassion ó am glad that Dr. Ford will not have to sell her two houses in Santa Cruz and in Santa Fe in order to pay for her lawyers and legal bills.Unlike Michael Flynn and Michael Caputo, who have had to sell everything in order to pay their legal bills because of Robert Muellerís investigation, Dr. Ford here is free and clear because her lawyers are pro bono. Democrats continue to make a big deal out of the fact that there was no FBI investigation and that Kavanaugh has refused to call for one. (chuckles) Kavanaughís undergone ó SIX! ó FBI investigations.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/27/my-early-thoughts-on-senate-judiciary-show/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 27, 2018RUSH: I know what the Republicans are trying to do. Theyíre trying to make it look like they are not bullying this woman at all. They are not bullying, they are not gonna treat her unfairly, and they are going to such great lengths to do this that they are not even questioning her. Theyíve hired a prosecutor ó a female prosecutor, sex-crimes prosecutor ó to come in and conduct questions. But it is wholly ineffective if youíre looking for immediate points scored or immediate gain, because you cannot do what sheís doing in five-minute intervals.It just isnít possible. The way itís going, sheís asking five-minutes worth of procedural questions that are designed to point out Blasey Fordís questionable and curious memory and memory lapses. And right as she gets going, the five minutes ends, and then the Democrats take over. And the Democrats simply say, ìYouíre not making it up; right? You remember it enough to know that it happened to you? Youíve been deeply affected by it?îìOh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.îAnd then it goes back to the Republicans and the lawyer ó the prosecutor ó picks up where she left off five or six minutes prior. In the midst of all this back-and-forth, the Democrats are getting their shots in on Grassley for his supposedly ineffective investigation, lack of taking it seriously. He then comes back and rebuts all of that and says theyíre wrong, he did it, and starts reciting every bit of behavior on the part of the committee majority to do the investigation. The problem here is ó and, look, I know whatís going on.In addition to not trying to be appearing like a bully, or being unfair, they also know this thingís gonna go on all day. And this prosecutor is laying a foundation and a case to eventually be able to say in a summation that, ìWe just canít trust what the witness is saying ícause she doesnít remember enough. There are too many contradictory memories. There are too many things here. We couldnít go to court with this case,î something of the sort. But, in terms of this being a television event, that is going to be lost on everybody watching this, and itís a television event.The fact is that it is going to determine the public reaction, which is gonna be highly determinant in whether or not there is a vote on Kavanaugh tomorrow. Also Kavanaugh has yet to appear. He will go last, and he will have a chance to refute all this, and there is talk that he is indignant and angry and will portray that in his appearance. But the way this is happening here ó since they agreed to-five-minute questions, five-minute question period ó thereís nothingÖI donít think Grassley can change the rules in the middle of it because his five minutes are not effective, his five-minute intervals. But you see, thereís a different way that you question a hostile witness in a deposition, which is how the Republican prosecutor is treating this. Sheís treating this as a deposition and not a hearing, and it isnít a deposition. It is a hearing. And in a deposition, you ask open-ended questions because youíre looking for information.In a hearing, you do the exact opposite. You ask leading questions because youíre trying to make a point. Youíre trying to make points, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. In a deposition, nobody ever sees it. Youíre preparing for trial. Itís recorded on video in an office somewhere, never in a courtroom or never in public like this. Depositions are rarely actually seen in toto, and itís to prepare for trial. This is the trial! This is, even though itís not, the moment of truth.There is no preparation for down the road here, and yet that is how this is being conducted. At a hearing, you donít ask, ìDo you remember how you got home that day?î You donít ask it that way. You ask, ìIsnít it a fact that somebody had to drive you home after you say you were assaulted? Isnít it a fact that you canít or wonít tell us who drove you home?î The witness has to be put on the spot. But I think maybe itís entirely possible the Republicans have told the prosecutor, ìDonít do that. We canít appear to be bullying her. We canít appear to be unfair.îQuestions like, ìSo youíre saying this traumatic event happens and you canít say what happened right afterwards? Youíre saying this traumatic event happened, but you canít say where? Youíre saying this traumatic event happened, but you canít say when for certain? You wonít tell us who drove you home and what you told that person right after this traumatic event?î Those are the questions that this prosecutor, if this were in court, would be asking.But treating this as a deposition, i.e., the collection of witness evidence and testimony for later use? There isnít gonna be any later use! Rachel Mitchell is the prosecutorís name. Itís frustrating, folks. Itís maddening to watch this. She asks five minutes of questions, but nobody knows what sheís driving at unless you arrive at this with some information and knowledge beforehand. Well, we canít relyÖI donít know how many people across the country are watching this. Iíd assume itís a lot. Itís a big stretch to assume that most people in the public watching already has a baseline of information so that her questioning would be understood in context. You canít do that this way. Despite how repulsive it might be or seem, this is theater. This is performance. All trials are. All hearings are. Itís just the extent that you want to go there or even admit it is an aspect here.But with these little five-minute periods of questions, nobody knows what sheís driving at because sheís asking open-ended questions in a very polite and I-donít-want-to-offend-you, schoolmarm kind of way. Right at the moment she starts to get someplace, bam! The five minutes are up and they gotta go to the Democrat whose turn it is next, and people forget where she was. We go back and itís her turn again, and she picks up where she left off where nobody can remember where that was.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I donít know whether this is studied and rehearsed or whether what weíre getting is the real deal. But Christine Blasey Ford comes across as very, very young and even her speech pattern. I donítÖ Sheís what is called an ìup-talker.î You know what an up-talker is? Some call it ìup-speak. î People that speak this way end their sentences with an upward inflection. (impression) ìI think, so sir. Uh, uh, well, I ó IÖ No, but I was thinking about it when I did.îIt makes the speaker sound teenager-ish, very, very young. Uber-nice. ìVulnerableî is the key word. Vulnerable and sensitive. When you talk to somebodyÖ Some people say itís annoying. But as a speech pattern, that conveys innocence, youth, vulnerability, valley girl-type thing. ìI donít know, Senator, but I would hope soooo. Uh, I ó I think I did, but IÖî Thatís why I donít know if this is practiced or if itís the way that she speaks.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I found it very strange that Dr. Ford did not know that the Senate committee had offered to come to her in California. She said that she didnít understand that, that if she had known that, that she would have welcomed them to California. Of course, she was on vacation a bunch of places in August. She was in New Hampshire and where else? New Hampshire and one other place. But she had to fly there. I mean, itís the East Coast. She lives up in the Left Coast.How come she didnít know that the committee had offered to fly out there? Did her lawyers not pass that on? She openly professed to being very confused by that, like she was hearing it for the first time that they had offered to fly out to see her since she didnít like to fly. It seemed like she didnít know it. Also, just her manner of speaking, folks, is gonna be a big obstacle. Sheís coming acrossÖ With that up-talker, up-speak technique that she has, it comes across, she sounds like a very, very young girl, very innocent, very vulnerable, very sensitive.(impression) ìAnd wants to do the right thing, um, I ó I ó I think?î She felt likeÖ One odd thing, too. Sheís a doctor. Doctorate in psychology. She acts like sheís totally unfamiliar with polygraph, and she was reduced to crying during the polygraph and said she felt like it was just all over her body, which was similar to how she described what happened to her in the room. Anyway, people have been waiting patiently on the phones to get in. Theyíve taken a recess here probably, luncheon recess. So weíll start in Lewiston, Idaho. This is Phil. And Iím glad you called, sir. Whatís your take on all this?CALLER: Hi, Rush. Thanks for taking my call.RUSH: Yes, sir.CALLER: Hey, I was struck when Dr. Ford mentioned run into Mark Judge at a grocery store several weeks after the incident and said that she said hello to him. That struck me as really odd, because Iíve talked to a lot of women in my life about bad encounters that theyíve had with men. Whether it was a bad date, whether it was a sexual type of a thing. Whatever it was, any time they saw that individual later, it was either anger or a frown or, ìIím getting out of here as fast as I can. I donít want to be seen.î But she talked about how she said hi to him and almost kind of indicated the friendliness theyíve had in the past, like she expected a conversation or something. And then he, you know, looked pale and so forth. It just seemed really odd that if she was take advantage of in the way that she describes, that she would have reacted that way when she saw him.RUSH: You know, thatís a good point. I was watching and listening when that happened, and I didnít make that connection. But youíre right. Youíre absolutely right. I mean, Iíve known people that didnít have any kind of trauma with people. They just dated íem and broke up with íem and see íem someplace and donít want to go anywhere near íem for some reason. Itís very common. Iíve seen that. Youíre absolutely right. When you add trauma and abuse to it, yeah, thatís a good observation. Iím glad you called.I realize many of you have been listening to the hearings wall-to-wall and many of your affiliates have been carrying the hearing from the beginning. I just want to share a couple observations with you that Iíve already shared with the audience that was listening to the program before we get back to the phones. That is to say that when we started a little bit after noon Eastern Time today, the hearings had been going on for an hour or so.I was struck by the Republican strategy here of having a female prosecutor take over the questioning for Republican senators. It seemed to be not what was called for. It seemed like that prosecutor was questioning Dr. Ford as though it was a deposition here, in preparation for something later like a trial or a hearing before a judge, and thatís not what this is. This is notÖ Thereís no time for a deposition here. You gotta get in, get it get it, and get out. Itís a different wayÖ You question a hostile witness in a deposition as opposed to the a hearing.In a deposition, which is what this looks like, you ask open-ended questions because youíre looking for information, and you might be trying to set up contradictions. You might be trying to, you know, spread or lay what are called perjury traps. There isnít time for that here unless thereís a grand strategy that will only reveal itself later in the day. In a hearing, which this is, you do ask leading questions because you are trying to make a point, and youíve gotta do it quick. You gotta get in there and get it.So in a hearing like this, you do not say, ìDo you remember how you got home that day?îìUh, well, I ó I think it was in a car. I ó I do.îYou say instead, ìIsnít it a fact that someone had to have driven you home after you say you were assaulted? Isnít it a fact that you canít or wonít tell us who it was that drove you home?î Because the point would be in a hearing, ìSo youíre saying this traumatic event happened, and you canít say what happened right afterward to somebody? You canít tell us who drove you home so we can go ask them what you said? You canít tell us what you said?îìNo. I ó I ó I my memory.îBut sheís not being asked questions like that. Sheís being asked open-ended questions. ìSo, do you remember how you got home?îìYou wonít tell us who drove you home and what you told that person right after the traumatic event?î should be the question.So the Republican prosecutorís name is Rachel Mitchell. She asked five minutes of questions but knows what sheís driving at because theyíre open-ended. We donít know what notes sheís taking. We donít know what sheís balancing the answers against that she has as her baseline there. Sheís asking these open-ended questions almost in a friendly schoolmarm kind of way, like Dr. Fordís been called to the principalís office. And by the time the prosecutor, Ms. Mitchell, gets going ó by the time she starts to zero in on what may be some contradictions ó her five minutes are up and we gotta shift over to the next Democrat senators who says, ìI believe you! I believe you! Are you sure it was Kavanaugh?îìYeeeees.îìHow much?îìOne-hundred percent! A 100%. I remember I remember 100%.îBut she doesnít remember anything else 100%.  "

Heís wipiní the floor with the Iranians. Heís wipiní the floor with the little Trudeau guy up in Canada. Heís wipiní the floor with the ìMacaroniî guy in France. He is letting it be known that the economic wave sweeping across the globe today starts in the United States, is maintained in the United States, and will continue to spread and grow from the United States. Trump today also announcedÖ He was chairing the Security Council meeting.It was his turn. Itís the United Statesí turn. So Trump chairs the meeting. Do you know how the deep state was panicking over this? Conservative, Never Trumpers? ìYou mean weíre gonna have this guy up there chairing a meeting at the U.N. at the Security Council?î They wereÖ Oh. They thought Trump would start throwing his shoe through glass windows and stuff. Trump pretty much led off by saying, ìThe ChiComs are trying to interfere in the 2018 elections. The ChiComs are trying to destroy Republican chances,î and Trump said, ìYou know why?ìBecause Iím wiping the floor with them on trade deals. The ChiComs are very unhappy at the success of my administration, at the success of the U.S. economy.î So now Trump has thrown a wrench into the gears. Usually itís he being accused of colluding, collaborating with the Russians over 2016. Now Trump says the ChiComs are trying to steal the 2018 elections away from the Republicans. So, while all this is going on, Trump is literally making tracks at the United Nations.About the only things the Drive-Bys have been able to say is that they laughed at Trump when he talked about how his administration has done more good in two years than any other administration in the history of the planet. Well, theyíre lying to you about when the attendees or the audience started laughing. There was some chuckles, just a little few chuckles when President Trump made commented that heís done more in two years than most administrations have done ever. There were some chuckles and Trump said, ìWell, thatís not quite the reaction I was looking for.îThatís what got the big laughter, not Trumpís claim, but his reaction to the initial little wave of chuckles. And thatís it. Thatís all the Drive-Bys have. The Drive-Bys other than that are ignoring Trump at the United Nations. They are ignoring economic data. They are ignoring everything going on that Trump is touching, other than Kavanaugh, because thereís nothing they can do to destroy it. Thereís nothing they can do to take it down, and I donít think they even want to try to convince people.So, all theyíve got is to continue to portray Trump as they always have been, that heís a boob and a dunce and doesnít know what heís doing and the world is laughing at him. Donít doubt me. The world is not laughing at Donald Trump. The Iranians are not laughing at Donald Trump. The ChiComs are not laughing at Donald Trump. Vladimir Putin shirtless on the horse wherever he is, heís not laughing at Donald Trump. That little pot-bellied dictator in North Korea, Kim Jong-un, is not laughing at Donald Trump.But the Never Trumpers in conservative media circles in the United States are continuing to try to laugh and act mock shocked and afraid.

So I see where Senator Grassley has given the accuser Christine Blasey Ford until 10 a.m. tomorrow to decide whether or not to show up on Monday, right? Grassley may want to get his new iPhone, may be what thatís about. Iím just kidding. By 10 a.m. tomorrow sheís gotta decide, and all the Democrats go, ìWell, theyíre bullying her! Theyíre bullying. You canítÖ You canít bully the accuser in these situations! You canít do it!î I tell you, folks, Robert Bork once said that weíre ìwitnessing the end of civilizationî while watching the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings.His buddy Irving Kristol walked by and said, ìWhat are you doing?î Bork said, ìWatching the end of civilization.î And Irving Kristol said, ìYeah, no question about that but at least we can still live well until it all goes kaput.î (chuckling) I think people are starting to get frustrated now because the Republicans have been bent over backwards to tell Ms. Blasey Ford and her supporters what they want from her, and the president has been bending over backwards. He said it would be wonderful if she would show up and testify.But, you know, thereís breaking news. There are new details emerging practically by the hour. Here we have the latest. It will unfold before your very eyes and ears as the program does. You know, Byron York had, by the way, a very good little tweet here. As these people are comparing this to Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill, and he points out some things that make it clear weíre not talking about the same thing here. Anita Hill testified. She testified in the hearings in October of 1991 that Thomas harassed her with a pubic hair on a Coke can in 1981.(interruption) Thatís what it was, folks. I mean, Snerdley is bowing his head in there, canít believe it. Well, I mean, that was the big deal. Remember, the media was going to video stores like Blockbusters trying to figure out secret porn movies that Thomas may have rented. I kid you not. And what was it? There was Long Dong Silver, thatís what it was! Somebody claimed that Justice Thomas had rented Long Dong Silver. (interruption) This is what a Supreme Court confirmation hearing was reduced to.Anyway, Byron York reminds us that Hill testified in October 1991 that Thomas harassed her in 1991 and í82. Thatís like ten years before, far more recent than Christine Blasey Fordís 36-year-old charge against Kavanaugh. Also, Hill and Thomas were both adults when the alleged pubic hair was left on the alleged Coke can in the workplace. They were both adults whereas weíre talking about teenagers in high school here with Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford. Now, the Democrats are livid. GrassleyÖWe were one of the first to point this out yesterday. Grassley even tried to get hold of the accuser and her lawyers, and theyíre not responding to him. She, of course, isnít, but her lawyers are not responding to Grassley. Grassley said (paraphrased), ìIíve tried smoke signals and Iíve tried SOS. Iíve tried Morse code. Iíve tried email. Iíve tried text. Iíve tried SMS. Iíve tried EMS. Iíve tried everything I know to do out there and I canít get a call-back from them.î So Mazie Hirono from Hawaii ó who obviously is seeing this as a moment to raise her national stardom ó is starting to utter profanity weíre not used to hearing from senators.Sheís saying (paraphrased), ìYou go to hell! You go to hell! That is BS,î except sheís not using the initials. And she says, ìGrassley, who are you to reach out and contact with woman without any of us know? You canít do that!î Why, is that bullying, too, the chairman of the committee trying to get hold of the lawyers? Anyway, what Grassleyís offeredÖ This is unprecedented. We were among the first to pass this on to you yesterday that Grassley even offered to take the Senate Judiciary Committee staff to California wherever Christine Blasey Ford is holed up.And theyíre rejecting that. And of course I predicted they would reject it. You know why they reject it? Because they will say sheís in hiding. Sheís afraid for her life because wacko Trump supporters are all over her. So this is just Grassley trying to find out where she lives so he can leak it to people and further endanger her. We canít let Grassley and his staff know where we are. (This is the tone that they are taking.) But it raises some questions. Why does an accuser claiming firsthand knowledge need more time to testify about her story?What kind of preparation is necessary here? Weíre talking about an event that took place in less than seven minutes if it happened. Seven minutes. Maybe not even that long. So what the hell else is there to remember? What really is there to prep for? Is the preparation designed to sound credible when you donít know what youíre talking about? Is the preparation designed to cover up for periods of time you donít recall? What could possibly be necessary here? She took a lie detector test. She wrote it all down. She was there.And her lawyers say she passed the lie detector test that they gave her. The Republicans desperately want to hear from her, and I donít think this is an act. You have the president saying (summarized), ìItíd be wonderful if she showed up. We want to hear what she has to say.î The president said yesterday, ìLook, if she shows up and credible, weíre gonna have to rethink this whole thing.î I mean, theyíre practically rolling out the red carpet for her. (interruption) What are you frowning at? (interruption) You think itís a sham? (interruption) You think itís a track? (interruption) What are you laughing at in there?They want to talk to her. They want her to show up. They want to hear her story. (interruption) Well, Snerdley says, ìSo you say the only reason theyíre acting eager to hear from her is because they know sheís not coming.î Okay, let me tell you. They know she doesnít have what? The story? She doesnít have the details? She doesnít have the goods? Is that what youíre gonna say, ìShe doesnít have what she claims to haveî? Sheís not gonna show up? Thatís what you think? (interruption) Okay. If she doesnít show up, Iím gonna tell you whatís gonna happen.Iím telling you right now itís already in the works with, and I know itís in the works because I heard a Drive-By Media person talking about it. The Drive-By Media person was Karen Tumulty of the Washington Post who says she wouldnít be surprised if more women surface over the weekend alleging similar acts by Kavanaugh. Sheís just telegraphed that theyíre out there trying to find women that they can convince to come forward and say what they want them to say. You know theyíre working on that.You know that the Democrat Party, you know that the media ó theyíre working in tandem ó are scouring women who went to the same school or went to school where Kavanaugh was seen, you know, lurking around and so forth. And theyíre gonna try to find as many women ó not too many, find one or two women ó to come forward and say, ìYeah, I didnít want to come forward but I watching whatís happening to Christine Blasey Ford, and I canít stand it.îSo donít be surprised. That would be the cover if she doesnít show. (interruption) Youíre sitting there thinking that the Republicans and you know sheís not gonna show. Well, that means the Democrats know sheís not gonna show. The Democrats are not gonna let the fact that she doesnít show kill their effort to wipe out Kavanaugh. So in replacement for her not showing, donít be surprised, donít be surprised if later today or tomorrow ó sometime before this 10 oíclock tomorrow morning headline ó that another woman surfaces.But I want to remind you one thing. We had audio yesterday from a friend of Christine Blasey Ford. Her name was Guerry, G-u-e-r-r-y. I forget her first name. Doesnít matter. We played the sound bites, and she was talking about how when they were in school that this kind of thing happened a lot. But not with Kavanaugh! She did not have any firsthand knowledge of anything Kavanaugh did, but she did say that all the boys ó a lot of the boys ó this is how they behaved. A lot of the boys did.ìYou mean Brett Kavanuagh?îìNo, no, no! I ó I ñîìShe made it so clear she never saw Brett Kavanaugh. She never heard his name in any of this. Well, to me thatís all anybody needs to know if weíve got a friend of Christine Blasey Ford coming out there trying to establish that Christine Blasey Ford is not making it up. But this woman, this friend of hers went out of her wayÖ Cookie, grab that bite again from yesterday. I mean, no mad dash hurry. Just whenever you get it. She made a point twice in the audio sound bite we played to make sure no, sheís not talking about Brett Kavanaugh here.Thereís also a little bit of news here. Thereís a website. Thereís a guy that runs a website. I donít have it right in front of me. I canít remember the name of the site. Iíll find it here in a second. Iíve not heard of the website before. But Iím gonna go ahead and tell you, the guy running the website claims that he knew that theyÖ He went and looked at the yearbook, the high school yearbook from the year in question here at the yearbook where Christine Blasey Ford went to school.What he saw, he writes, convinced him that they were gonna have to scrub that yearbook from the web. Theyíre gonna have to delete it. Theyíre gonna have to erase it. So knowing that that would happen earlier this week, he made screenshots and copies and so forth and cached it. The yearbook for the year your question here at Christine Blasey Fordís school is allÖ (laughs) Well, not all about, but there are numerous references of the girls having keggers, keg party after keg party.There are stories, ìWhat we did when the parents were gone,î complete with pictures, making it look like the girls in this school knew how to party with a keg just like guys did. And it establishes that, you know, many of the entrees or entries in this particular yearbook make it clear that people didnít remember the next day what had happened the night before in perfect detail and so forth. So he writes that when he saw it, he predicted that they would scrub this. Theyíd have to get rid of it. Theyíd have to wipe it off of the Web.And it is. Itís gone. So we have that little bit of detail. But back to this whole thing. Republicans want to hear from her, despite the smirks from Mr. Snerdley. The Republicans want to hear from her. Theyíre making it clear. The media believes her. Iím asking here why doesnít she show up? Here. Grab sound bite No. 22. Cookie came through. This was yesterday afternoon on Wolf Blitzed on CNN. Jim Acosta was Acosta-ing Christine Blasey Fordís friend and ex-classmate, Samantha Guerry. And Acosta said, ìWhat Dr. Ford is alleging, is this the first time you heard anything like that about Judge Kavanaugh?îGUERRY: Itís not the first time Iíve heard anything like that in terms of the community of women I know, and not regarding him but óACOSTA: Those sorts of things went on?GUERRY: A lotÖ You know, one of the things thatís surprising to me as Iíve gotten involved in this in the last couple days is how many women of my class have come forward to me in this last few days and said, ìI had similar experiences in high school,î and this hits me very deeply and itís very óACOSTA: Not with Brett Kavanaugh, but with other boys?GUERRY: Not with Brett Kavanaugh! But with other boys in our community, and we all feel that if we were in her shoes, weíd want (chuckles) to be taken seriously as well.RUSH: Okay. Fair enough. But, look, thereís some questions here. This woman is 50-some-odd years old now ó same age as Christine Blasey Ford ó and she says, ìYou know, one of the things thatís surprising to me as Iíve gotten involved in this in the last couple days is how many women of my class have come forward to me in this last few days and said, ëI had similar experiences in high schoolíÖî Well, if you went to high school with íem, why wouldnít you know it when they happened? So much of this doesnít pass the consistency test.But the primary thing here is, ìItís not the first time Iíve heard anything like that in terms of the community of women that I know, not regarding him.î Meaning: I donít know anything about Kavanaugh. And then Acosta, after she describes how women of her class have come forward the last few days and told her they had similar experiences in high school and it now hits her very deeply ícause because I know all this was going on while she was in high school. But now sheís hearing about it from all of her friends who say, ìOh, yeah, it was going on in high school.îBut not with Brett Kavanaugh! She makes it clear twice here that in all of this debauchery that was supposedly going on at this private school, she never heard the name Brett Kavanaugh mentioned. Yet sheís coming forward here in support of Christine Blasey Ford. Now, does thatÖ To me, this is the kind of thing that gets passed over. The Drive-By Media conducts the interview, they hear the answer, doesnít even register. To me, this is close to bombshell.You got a good buddy exonerating Kavanaugh from the type of behavior she says sheís now learned was commonplace. Not Kavanaugh though. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no! Not Brett Kavanaugh. So why does she need more time to testify when sheís got firsthand knowledge? Why does she need more time when she took a lie detector test? She wrote it all down. She answered the questions. The Republicans desperately the want to hear from her. The president said itíd be a wonderful thing. The media believes her.The media wants to believe this woman so bad that they already do. So why is Kavanaugh ó who is portrayed as a creepy liar by the media. Why is he ready, willing, and able to testify and Ford isnít? Could somebody explain that to me? He said heíll show up anytime, anywhere. She will not! I think Senator Grassleyís handled this well. For people following the story, itís clear whatís going on. Knee-jerk identity politics haters and abortion zealots. Nothing matters to them anyway other than that.Republicans are evil because theyíve got minds of their own. It doesnít matter how accomplished and achieved and impeccable their reputations are like Kavanaugh. It desnít matter how much charity work they do. It doesnít matter how many people vouch for them. It doesnít matter how many people love and adore them. It doesnít matter how stellar their lives and career and work has been. It doesnít matter if theyíve led normal, productive lives. Nothing matters except removing them as obstacles.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. So the reason that she needs more time is what? (interruption) This was so traumatic that she has been trying to forget it. Sheís been trying toÖ? (interruption) Right. Sheís been trying to forget it her whole life, and, now, because of these dastardly Republican senators sheís being forced to try to remember it? Thatís what theyíre telling us is why she canít show up and testify immediately because she spent all this time trying to forget it? Now sheís being forced to remember it? Okay. So what evil, dastardly Republican made her write her letter to Senator Feinstein?I mean, she started this process, did she not? In fact, if weíre to believe something, the Democrats and the media are really to blame for her trauma here. She wrote the letter to Feinstein, but she asked that it not be made public and that her name not be mentioned. And somebody ó either on Feinsteinís staff or some colleague ó on the Democrat side leaked all of this against Christine Blasey Fordís wishes. Meanwhile, the Republicans are catching all the heat here, but itís the Democrats and the media who want this woman to put her psyche at risk in order to nail this nominee.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Senator Grassley is trying to convince Kavanaugh accuser to testify on Monday. He said, ìWhat Iím focused right now is do everything we can to make Dr. Ford comfortable with coming before a committee either in an open session or closed session, public or private interview.î He even offered to go to California. No matter what Grassley has offered, the answer has been, ìNyet, nyet, nyet.îHe was even willing to send committee staff to California to speak with the Kavanaugh accuser. Mazie Hirono, the Democrat senator from Hawaii, says Grassleyís office hasnít really tried to contact the illusive doctor, professor, Ph.D. He hasnít really tried! He hasnít really tried! Heís just saying heís try. He doesnít really mean it, according to Mazie Hirono. In an interview with ABC News, ìshe called the assertions that Republicans had exhausted every method to contact Blasey BS,î except she didnít say ìBS.î She said the word.ìëI would like for us to come together and figure out whatís the best way to proceed,í Hirono says in the video. ëNot this seat-of-the-pants stuff,í she added.î She doesnít like this. ìA communications aide for Grassleyís office responded, however, calling Hironoís claim ënonsenseí and stating that the committee had made multiple attempts to contact Ford directly. ëThis is such nonsense. The committee has sent nine emails and left two voicemails,í communications adviser Garrett Ventry wrote on Twitter.îNow, Mazie Hironoís out there saying Kavanaughís fudging the truth. She doesnít know what the truth is here. You know, weíre back to this. Weíre back to a woman says it, you gotta believe it, except thatís only in force when the Democrats are not in power or when the women doing the accusing are accusing Republicans. But when the women were accusing Bill Clinton, they were targeted and destroyed. The double standards are rife.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: This Jerry in upstate New York. Welcome, sir. Great to have you here.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Been a listen since around 2012. Iím what you can call a surprise a Millennial by age. Had a quick theory for you on the Blasey Ford-Kavanaugh situation.RUSH: Okay.CALLER: So Iím thinking that obviously Democratic Partyís pushing for this FBI investigation before she testifies so that they can be sure that whatever she has to say during the testimony, that it aligns with what the FBI is, you know, so-called gonna uncover.RUSH: Oh. Youíre saying they want the FBI to go first so that she can coordinate with what she tells the FBI and be consistent with it?CALLER: Correct. Yeah. I havenít heard anybody mention anything, you know, regarding that. But thatís just a theory I was thinking about.RUSH: You mean that theyíre trying to make sure she doesnít get convicted of lying to the FBI and going to jail like Martha Stewart or Michael Flynn? I donít thinkÖ (laughing) I marvel at theÖ Itís very fascinating the way people think. Thatís an interesting point that youíre making. The whole idea of the FBI investigating a high school event from 36 years ago. Itís not exactly what they do. But the left is saying, ìTrump could make íem! TrumpÖ Trump could tell the FBI to do anything,î except Trump canít make them (chuckles) declassify documents.Trump is now declassifying some of this stuff and the Democrats are running around saying, ìHe canít do that! ThatÖ ThatÖ He canít do that! Thatís a violation their security.î On the other hand, ìTrump, you make the FBI investigate this.î Theyíre so all over the ballpark and all over the place. Jerry, I appreciate the call. Find audio sound bite No. 12. This is what I alluded to, if she doesnít testify, if she doesnít accept the invite by 10 a.m. tomorrow. Hereís Karen Tumulty last night, Fox News Channelís Special Report, Shannon Bream. This is the All-Star Panel and Karen Tumulty talking about what could happen to change the Kavanaugh story between now and Monday.TUMULTY: The thing I think we all need to remember is that we still have 4-1/2 days until Monday. And weíreÖ The way the news cycle works in these times, this ó this whole thing is probably gonna take five or six twists and turns.BREAM: Right.TUMULTY: Now, maybe other people coming out of the woodwork either to verify what Judge Kavanaugh is saying or to back up when she is saying. By Monday, this could look like a very different situation.RUSH: All righty now. How do you translate that, folks? Iím gonna tell you what it means. Karen Tumulty is expecting that by time Monday comes around the media will have found additional women to come forward and say, ìOh, yeah! Kavanaugh did this to me. I know Kavanaugh did this to a bunch of women.î Thatís what sheís telegraphing here.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: John in Cape Canaveral, Florida.† Iím glad you waited.† I really am.† And welcome to the program, sir.† Hi.CALLER:† Thank you, Rush.† Mega law enforcement dittos, longtime listener, first-time caller.RUSH:† Thank you.† Love hearing from law enforcement.CALLER:† Well, I tell you, we used to have to have our own little transistor radios bungee corded to the dashboard because back in the late í80s there were no commercial radios in the patrol cars.RUSH:† Yeah, I remember that.† I remember hearing about that.† Airline pilots also had to listen to the program on the HF radio up in the cockpit.† People going intoÖ Yeah, had Rush rooms in the restaurants and everything so people wouldnít miss anything when they went in to eat.† Transistors in the cop cars.† I remember hearing about that.CALLER:† Yep, you had to actually strap íem onto the dashboard because, you know, occasionally there were some interesting turns and the transistors would end up in all sorts of strange places.RUSH: †(laughing) Well, you know, I used to do that when I was 12, 13, riding a bicycle.

(laughing) I was just cracking up watching it on CNN as they were reporting ó one of their infobabes, Kaitlan Collins, was reporting ó how stunned Trumpís own aides are at how gentle and nice heís being to the accuser! They canít believe it! Trumpís own people, the people who know him best, cannot believe that heís a nice guy. I wanted you to actually hear it. This is Kaitlan Collins talking about Trump to Wolf Blitzer, who asked her, ìWhat are you hearing about the White House strategy and how the president handled this problem and all the problems surrounding the Kavanaugh nomination?îCOLLINS: Aides back here in the West Wing are quietly stunned by just how respectful President Trump has been when talking about this woman who has accused his Supreme Court nominee of sexually assaulting her when they were a teenager. (sic) Aides really thought on Sunday that when President Trump read that Washington Post interview where she first came forward detailing this allegation that he may have that sense of volcanic anger that weíve seen from the president before.President Trump himself has been boasting this week to allies and outside advisers about the positive coverage heís getting in response to the measured response that heís had about these allegations. And aides say they think (gulp) that that has helped encourage him to continue responding in such a measured way. But also, they think that a lot of that restraint, Wolf, has to do with the fact that this allegation isnít made against the president. The president is gonna leave the White House here in a few hours. Heís going to Las Vegas for a rally tonight. Of course, Wolf, know those rallies are where the president is often not very scripted and not usually on topic sometimes ó and heís often in a room full of supporters who are chanting and cheering him on!RUSH: So what the reporterette here is expecting is for Trump to become who he is again. Once heís in Vegas and with his supporters, heíll start ripping into his accuser, heíll start ripping into the Democrats, and heíll blow this new persona that heís established that nobody can believe. (interruption) Yeah. IÖ (interruption) (interruption) Yes. Snerdley asked me, ìDo you believe there are Trump aides that talk to CNN?î Yes. I think Trumpís got one of the leakiest West Wings weíve ever had.I think there are a lot of people in there that are out for themselves to this day still. I donít have any doubt that theyíre leaking in there. I donít have any doubt that they would make something like this up. People that know Donald Trump know thatÖ Itís not news that heís a nice guy! Believe me. Itís not news that he treats people with respect! Heís got no animus about this woman. Heís not.. This isnít anything about him and heís treating this in the exact way he should.But the point of this is that even when heís behaving in ways that all of these establishment people think he should ó with the proper decorum, a proper morality, heís being presidential ó even then, it isnít real. Even then, heís faking it. Itís so unreal that his staff doesnít even believe it, and then they throw bit in (impression), ìYeah, heís so excited with the coverage heís getting, he might continue being a nice guy.ìBut thatís until he gets to Vegas tonight, Wolf! As you well know, Wolf, the president goes off script ó and heís in that room with those literally insane supporters of his ó and thatís when anything can happen, Wolf. And we will be there, Wolf, to chronicle every instance of Trump not being this fake nice guy that heís been acting the past three days.î Thatís what her report meant.  "

The reason Iím calling you is Iím a retired Defense Department federal employee, and, during part of my career, I was the family advocacy officer at a large Air Force base here in the United States.RUSH: What does a family advocacy officer do?CALLER: Well, we investigated cases of suspected child abuse, child neglect, and spouse abuse, and we accepted referrals from anybody in the Air Force or the local community.RUSH: Oh, okay.CALLER: And we had a standard which was called ìreasonable suspicion.î And it was a fairly low standard where if it even looked like there might be a hint that something really happened, we would open a case, do an investigation, receive reports from other agencies, medical reports, interview all the people involved. But if we didnít feel that it even met a minimum standard, we closed the case and called it ìno reasonable suspicion.î My experience tells me this case has ìno reasonable suspicion.îRUSH: Well óCALLER: Thereís no information.

Weíre now in the #MeToo movement, where there are exceptions, but for the most part the woman says it and you have to believe it, at least in terms of how you approach it. You have to believe it. It is political suicide not to accept it as true or likely. You just canítÖYour standard of reasonable suspicion, try that term out.

We live in a different era now.CALLER: We sure do.RUSH: The nature of the evidence is everything. I mean, the seriousness of the charge is everything and nature of evidence doesnít count for much at all.CALLER: I agree with you totally, Rush. And itís really sad, because a good manís reputation and his life are being ruined. Thatís why we had the standard that we did. And we were audited by all kinds of people, we cooperated with all kinds of local agencies on and off the Air Force base. We had to have good documentation for everything that we did.

I needed to call because I also am one of those angry women whoís mad at the angry women because I was attacked when I was younger, 11 years old, by two boys, and I just wanted to say I can remember the exact place I was, every bit about the incident.

Weíre in the middle of it. We follow it each and every day; so the impact may be not as great as it should be. But this is a genuine abomination what is happening here, what has happened to Donald Trump for the past two years. I have a story here ó actually, a column.Itís by Julie Kelly at AmGreatness.com, and the title of her piece: ìMedia Continues Its Slow Suicide,î and her opinion is that despite the appearance, despite how it looks on television every day that the media and their partners ó their willing accomplices ó are in the process of destroying themselves. They are destroying respectability. They are destroying their own credibility. They are in the process of literally a death spiral because of their contempt for Trump and their efforts to destroy a duly elected president.I realize a lot of you are not buying it. ìThatís crazy.

The media isnít hurting itself.î I know itís hard to see, and I know it doesnít feel like the media is losing anything, and I know things look depressing. Thatís by design. But the Drive-By Media and the Democrat Party are on the same desperate mission, and it is a death spiral fight for survival for them right now.They are slashing, splashing, smashing out, doing everything they can to save themselves. They do not run Washington. Donald Trump does. They are beside themselves that they havenít been able to take him out. Theyíre beside themselves they havenít been able to drive him out. Theyíre beside themselves that they have not been able to split you away from him, and theyíre going more and more insane over their failures each and every day. The Woodward book. The Omarosa stuff!All of this has come out and Trump is still there, and heís still leading, and heís still dominating, and has a still triumphing. These questions got themselves talked into this business that theyíre gonna win the House, theyíre gonna win the Senate, theyíre gonna impeach Trump. Today theyíre gonna impeach Kavanaugh! If Kavanaugh gets confirmed, if theyíre not able to stop himÖ This is from Eric Swalwell from California. (paraphrased) ìIf Kavanaugh gets confirmed and as expected, the Democrats win the House and Senate, then weíre gonna impeach Kavanaugh as well as impeach Trump!îThey are convinced that what they are doing is lauded and being supported and applauded by the vast majority of the American people. They continue to conduct and publish what I think are crazy polls that they end believing, just like Hillary believed the polls that she was gonna win in a landslide. The latest polls that I saw is from Reuters/Ipsos and you know what it says? The American public is losing faith fast in Brett Kavanaugh.The American public may not support Kavanaughís nomination to the Supreme Court! Well, that doesnít matter, number one. But No. 2, I just refuse to believe that. I refuse to believe that a majority of the American people are watching whatís happening here and supporting it and applauding it. I think that there is so much disgust out there, I think there is so much outrage, I think people are livid at what theyíre watching being done to Kavanaugh!After having seen it happen to Clarence Thomas and Robert Bork and after having seen thisÖ Kavanaughís only getting now what Trump gets every day. Trump gets this every day and d I think people are fed up with it. I think a lot of people are fed up with it. I know the polls are out there, Democrats are gonna sweep this and that. But then something got in the way, folks. I donít know if youíve heard about this, but there was a shocking special election win by a Republican last night in Texas.Voters elected political newcomer Pete Flores to the Texas Senate on Tuesday, flipping a Democrat district red for the first time in 139 years and bolstering Republicansí supermajority in the chamber ahead of November elections. Wait a minute. I thought Beto, whatever his name, was gonna beat Cruz, that the Texas Republicans were gonna lose Texas, the Senate, everything else, and Texas was on the verge of becoming a blue state! Why, thatís what all the polls say.Texas is in the middle of going like California and New York and so forth. And then this happened. This is a district that Hillary Clinton won. I forget the majority here,but itís 73% black and Hispanic. Itís 23% white privilege, and they elected a Republican for the first time in 139 years. ìA retired game warden, [Pete] Flores defeated former state and U.S. Rep. Pete Gallego for the Senate District 19 seat after receiving backing from some of the stateís most prominent politicians, including Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, and U.S. Sens John Cornyn and Ted Cruz. ÖìAccording the secretary of stateís website, Flores won with 53% of the vote, Gallego at 47%, there 44,487 ballots cast.î This wasnít supposed to happen. Remember, Texas is going blue! This is a blue district in Texas that the Democrats have held for 139 years, and a Republican won it. How in the hell does that happen? Now, my overall point with this is that I think that Julie Kelly has a point. But I have to take a break, as always. We see rightÖ And I really just get revved and ready and I get right to the sweet spot; then I look at the clock and go, ìDamn it.îBREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I have cited the work of Lee Smith several times. Heís worked at a website called, I think, Tablet. His work has appeared a lot of places. Heís done some of the best investigative work along with a lot of other people in uncovering the hoax and the scam that is the Steele Dossier, Papadopoulos, the entire lies, series of lies that Trump colluded with Russia.He has written a piece called ìExtinction Level.î Well, itís not what itís called, but he describes in this piece what he says is an ìextinction-level eventî for the media. And it consists of much of what he has been reporting on, text messages between Strzok Smirk and Lisa Page; just the general collapse in trustworthiness that people have for some of these law enforcement institutions, DOJ, FBI, the intelligence community, and so forth.But Smith believes that the mediaís in the process of literally crashing and burning here and sacrificing every bit of credibility and reputation theyíve ever had in service to the advancement of agenda, and that more people than ever before are now seeing what the media is and what itís becoming. And as that continues to expand, they lose more and more credibility and believability. I know itís hard to believe, but there are people out there actively who think this.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Carmel, Indiana. Tracy, welcome. Glad you waited. Youíre up next for the EIB Network. Hi.CALLER: Wow, Rush. What an honor.RUSH: Thank you!CALLER: Mega dittos from the great unwashed Midwest.RUSH: (laughing) Ha-ha-ha. Right where Iím from, by the way.CALLER: Absolutely. So, I was giving my daughter the CliffsNotes version on Brett Kavanaugh, and then I tuned in and you were talking about the media and how theyíre all-in and theyíre selling it and giving it all they got. And I just want some reassurance from you about what percentage of people do you think are buying that schlock? You know, a lot of people are disgusted about politics, they donít want to hear about it anymore, but if we donít pay attention, this stuff keeps going on.RUSH: Well, I donít know.CALLER: So I just wonder, should we pay attention than not?RUSH: Well, let me answer this. The first thing I have to tell you that is that nothing, nowhere, no how, any ways, is going to change the way the media is doing, what itís doing about this or any other story. They, in any number of public opinion polls, the media is like sitting there with 2 to 5% respect. Itís lower than Congress in many polls, just as an industry and as a business, as a political entity. The media doesnít care. Itís the one business where they donít give a ratís rear end what the customer think because they have a disdain and a contempt for the customer. Look at CNN! CNN has been hemorrhaging audience for two years. They donít care. It doesnít matter to them.CALLER: I know. But I still see it on in my bank. When I go into the bank in the red county, in the red state where I live, I see CNN. I donít get why there isnít more of public outrage about it.RUSH: Well, we donít know that there isnít. The polling data is suggestive that people are not buying what they see. Look. This is a real tough one. Itís a tough thing to answer. Thatís why, Iíve got this piece here that ran in American Greatness by Julie Kelly who thinks that the media, and sheís got some assists here from a column, great guy called Lee Smith. They think that the media is committing suicide specifically with the way theyíve been conducting business since the presidential campaign and after Trump was elected. But you donít believe that, I can tell, ícause you go into your bank and thereís CNN, you donít see anybody committing suicide, you see ëem still on the air.CALLER: Absolutely. And Iím really surprised there hasnít been another major upstart of a conservative news outlet. I get Breitbart and all those things. I just mean besides Fox, Iím surprised nobodyís built a website like Twitter for conservatism.RUSH: Well, IÖ Look, I can only guess. I could only guess at that.CALLER: Well, Iím gonna get on and drive my school bus. I have to go. Iím so thrilled to talk to you, but I want to tell you thanks for the Rush Revere books. My homeschooled daughters have really enjoyed them; so thanks, and I hope they keep coming.RUSH: Well, thank you very much. You even said homeschool. You drive a school bus.CALLER: I did!RUSH: Awesome. Awesome. Well look, Iím glad you called, Tracy, thank you very much. Folks, I wish I had confident, comforting predictions about the media. What I know is that no matter how bad it gets for them, no matter how much audience they lose, no matter how much money their parent companies lose, theyíre not gonna change. The last thing theyíre gonna do.Theyíre gonna remain who they are and what they are and how they do it regardless, because they are a political entity in their own minds. Theyíre not a business entity. The people that work in media donít care about profitability. In fact, most of them think that the news divisions of the companies for which they work ought not even be subject to bottom line consideration because they have a constitutional duty.And there should be any limits on money, and there shouldnít be any profit pressures. But in terms of it affecting their content, it ainít gonna happen. Theyíll just keep playing people off, if they continue to lose money, but itís not gonna have any kind of impact that you would expect any other business losing customers would adapt and change. Not the media. So however bad it gets for them, youíre really not gonna see the evidence of it because theyíre gonna keep doing as they always have.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Let me read to you just a couple of excerpts from Julie Kellyís piece, ìMedia Continues its Slow Suicide.î Now, youíve heard much of this from your host. Her uniqueness here is that she is predicting that all of this is gonna lead to the media imploding and destroying itself, and Iím justÖ I would love to tell you I agree with her about this. You know, there are a lot of peopleÖ During the Clinton years and all through Obama years I can remember the number of moralists, for example, on our side ó good people ó who wrote that Clinton doing this or Obama doing that or now the FBI, DOJ doing this is going to destroy the their collective reputations and so forth.And it didnít happen. It was like these people were stuck in a period of time in the past where there was such a thing as public shame and that a reputation was subject to oneís own integrity or lack thereof. But people with no integrity and dishonesty who are able to pull that off in a likable way would keep getting away with it. Here you got a guy, Kavanaugh, who has an impeccable reputation and virtually every aspect of his life, every aspect. His reputation, character, unassailable ó and now, where is it?What would you say they have done to his reputation? While Ted Kennedy kills a woman, has a habit of abusing and disrespecting women, abusing them sexually down here in Palm Beach with his nephew, William Kennedy Smith. Mary Jo Kopechne! Whatíd they do? They turn him into the lion of the Senate. He becomes one of the most respected, revered Democrats ever. Bill Clinton, ditto. Meanwhile, Clarence, there was never a shred of evidence he did anything that they said ó and zilch, zero, nada for Kavanaugh ó and yet look what happened to them.You want to tell me that thereís any justice in this? There isnít any justice in this whatsoever. The left doesnít care. They are happy! Theyíre more than happy to destroy people. They attempt it every day, depending on who they think is in their way. So, yeah, a lot of people over the years have expected the kind of behavior to come back and haunt these people and bite íem in the rear.But the last I looked, Ted Kennedy passed away with glowing hero worship by everybody in the Democrat Party. You couldnít get them to talk about his at all teammate of women, show any kind of disrespect for him whatsoever. Ditto with Bill Clinton ó and the list on the Democrat sideís longer than just those two. So the belief that somehow there is a moral code that ends up meting out, handing out justice? I donít think people believe that anymore.I donít think people believe that there is a set of standards that define goodness and decency and that they triumph. I think what people are seeing is that indecency, perversion, lying, character assassination and assault are what is winning. They are the champions of political life in America today. So you can forgive people if they donít believe that all of this is eventually gonna come back and bite people and hold them accountable. But here we haveÖConrad Black is one of those people. Conrad Black is insistent that these people gonna pay a price they canít even imagine paying, that the American people are gonna be the ones to let them know what a bunch of reprobates everybody think they are. Conrad Black has untold faith that this is gonna happen. So does Julie Kelly writing in American Greatness, and so does Lee Smith. Hereís an excerpt of what sheís written. Youíve heard much of this on this program.She says, ì[T]here is a more sinister agenda behind this collective media cacophony: To hide their complicity in the biggest political scandal of all time, which included the weaponization of the nationís most powerful government agencies to spy on a rival presidential campaign; the illegal leaking of classified information to friendly journalists to defame American citizens associated with the [Trump] campaign; and the sabotage of an incoming presidency, the media is happy to distract us with manufactured non-scandals that advance the political interests of their friends.îLook thereís been thereís no question, I believe the Mueller investigation is, in large part, a massive cover-up of the real crimes committed by the people that run that town ó the Democrats, the media, people in the Washington establishment. Thatís all to be covered up. Theyíre the ones that committed real crimes, and they continue to commit them against the Trump presidency. She continues here.ìEach week, new details emerge about how the media seeded the Trump-Russia collusion hoax.î That has been uncovered, by the way. They ranÖ Iíll tell you how they did it. They ran a test program on this with the Iran nuclear program. They fed a bunch of journalists a bunch of garbage to see if they would repeat it and report it, and they did! They didnít even question what they were being told!The Obama administration actually told a journalist that Russia was responsible for the destruction of a dam in Vermont, and the guy rehab the story. The dam has not been destroyed. Itís still functioning. So the Obama administration seeds journalists with a bunch of garbage just to see if they run it. So they ran it during the Iran nuclear deal news cycle; so they figure they could get away with leaking a bunch of stuff not true about Trump and collusion Russia ó and they were right, because the media is a bunch of liberal Democrat sycophants!So she writes, ìEach week, new details emerge about how the media seeded the Trump-Russia collusion hoax. High-level federal officials acting in bad faith schemed with reporters eager for a scoop to spin nefarious tales about the president and his aides. Some of the resultant articles were cited as evidence to persuade a secret court to allow the U.S. government to spy on private citizens.ìFormer FBI Director James Comey admitted he had a friend leak a copy of his internal memo to the press to help prompt the special counsel probe into Trump-Russia collusion.î This writer, Julie Kelly, thinks all this stuff is gonna come back and bite these people and sink them. And my question is, ìWith who? Whoís gonna sink íem?î The American people? The American people, if they lose respect for the media, does that sink the media?I donít think so because thatís already happened. Whatís gonna sink the media? RICO lawsuits? (laughing) I donít know! Whatís gonna sink the media? Whatís gonna shame these people? There ought to be piles and piles of shame over what is being done to Brett Kavanaugh. Dianne Feinstein should be ashamed. Chuck Schumer should be ashamed. These people ought to be literally embarrassed about what theyíre doing!But theyíre not.Theyíre patting each other on the back.Theyíre already throwing advance parties because they think theyíre gonna delay this and win Senate and deny this nomination. They applauding each other on the back for subscribing a wonderful man and his family. They ought to be ashamed. They ought to have guilt complexes just bollixing them up so theyíre unable to function! Most normal people wouldnít be able to live with themselves pulling off stunts like this over and over and over again.ìWell, itís what the Republicans did! Itís what the Republicans did to Merrick Garland.î Republicans didnít do anything of the sort to Merrick Garland! They just delayed the vote, thatís all, because it was an election year for which there was Democrat Party precedent? Thank you, Joe Biden.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/17/how-do-decent-people-deal-with-such-dastardly-attacks/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 17, 2018RUSH: Okay. So I have a question, folks. How are decent people ever prepared to deal with these kinds of never-ending allegations, destruction, perversion? I mean weíre dealing with a genuine sickness here with people on the left, and itís not right. Something about them is just not right, and I was sitting here saying wondering. This never ends, and itís getting worse and worse and worse. Decent people are blindsided by this stuff every time it happens, and thereís a reason for that. Decent people do not wallow in this kind of mire.Decent people are not calculating and plotting how to destroy people, how to ruin them. Decent people donít do that. Decent people might get into arguments with people, try to find out how to win the argument or defeat a political opponent or whatever, but destroying people is not what decent people do. And, as such, decent people ó it seems like ó are always surprised. I myself, I have to tell youÖ Back during the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill situation. Back then, this programÖ Donít misunderstand me.This program was it as far as opposition to the left was concerned. The only cable news network at the time of Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill was CNN, and they had a much larger audience than they have today. They went wall-to-wall with this, and this situation is almost identical! Weíre gonna run through some of the parallels here. Itís almost identical! Almost identical. Particularly in terms of the timeline. I remember I was thinking about this and I was just livid when this happened.I was so mad, and I didnít hide any of my anger. During the heat of the moment here, I had a Rush to Excellence Tour appearance in Tulsa, I believe. It was either Oklahoma City or Tulsa. Iím pretty sure it was Tulsa. And I spent the entire, almost 90% of the two-hour stand-up that I did on Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas. I was looking at peopleís faces in the audience ó and there were thousands, five or six thousand people there ó and I could tell that some people were not even aware what I was talking about. Most were, but some werenít.But I just remember being so livid, and I remember devoting every ounce of energy I had every day on this program to exposing what I knew was a pack of lies about Clarence Thomas. I did not know Clarence Thomas at the time. I had not met him. I only know who he was. I knew friends of his. I knew people that vouched for him. I knew that no allegation like this had ever been made about him. What I learned about Anita Hill, what I learned about all this was this was just a Democrat trick.It was the next stage of Borking that was started by Robert Bork, and it was interesting to me to get introspective and go back and relive it. So weíre talking 1990, thereabouts, and I was remembering just how wired I was every day here and I was fit to be tied. I was just livid. After the Borking thing, I was hell-bent on blowing the Democrats up. I was hell-bent on exposing them for what they were doing ó and Judge Thomas ended up being confirmed. But then what happened after that?What happened after that is that we got a series of books, a series of television miniseries, and a couple years ago an actual HBO movie reliving Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill. And every book and every television series and the HBO movie is devoted to the lie that Clarence Thomas was guilty. So even if Kavanaugh survives this, he has the rest of his life to look forward to being smeared every year. There will be books by Jane Mayer or somebody taking her place.HBO will come up with a movie at some point, and when a young generation is about to come of age, thatís when HBO or somebody like them will do their movie to inform them of what a reprobate Brett Kavanaugh is. Because the left doesnít stop in their efforts to destroy people with whom they just disagree. Judge Kavanaugh hasnít done anything to anybody, other than his job, other than render rulings as a judge from various courts on which he has sat.He hasnít done anything to anybody. Heís a decent person. Itís obvious heís a decent person. He may define what a decent person is. He may be the epitome of decency. Same thing for his family. Yet here comes the left targeting ó once again ó another decent human being who happens to be Republican and conservative for utter destruction. Ruin his career, ruin his reputation, ruin his life and all of those who speak up and try to defend him. How do decent people deal with this?Iím not just talking about Kavanaugh. How do you? How do I? How does anybody? How do any of us in what I consider to be the decent people population of this country, deal with this? My point is weíre never prepared for this because we donít wallow in it. Even I, who was livid, who was devoted during the Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill scenario defending him, to beating back whatever little bit I could do here. I was committed. Yet I was caught off guard by this Kavanaugh thing last week when DiFi brings it up!I should have been expecting them to do something, but I wasnít. We thought Kavanaugh was nearing the vote; he was gonna sail through and be confirmed despite the Democratsí efforts. How stupid are we? Now, some of you may have seen it coming. I canít speak for all of you. Iím only speaking for myself. I didnít see it coming, and I should have! But then I started to asking, ìWhy did I miss it?î The reason I missed it is because I donít wallow in this stuff. I donít sit around and wait.Iím not trying to calculate when somebodyís gonna come out of the woodwork and try to destroy somebody else. Even though Iíve been the target of these kinds of efforts. My point is that decent people do not spend their time in this kind of mind-set. Who wants to? And this is something else that the left takes advantage of. I mean, where to start with this? The parallels between this and Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill are stunning. But letísÖ Before doing that ó and maybe even instead of doing that ó letís just recap with recent history.Last Thursday we were under the impression that Kavanaugh had withstood what everybody knew was gonna be an onslaught and an attempt, if not to derail him, to put a cloud over him so that everything he does the rest of his life is now questioned by the media and the American left. Make no mistake: Even if he gets on the court, that is going to continue. This guyís life as heís known it is over just like Justice Thomasí was. Last Thursday we were told that Kavanaughís accuser didnít want to go public.We were told that she didnít want to be named. We were told that she didnít want to Senator Feinstein to pursue anything. How do we know this? Because Senator Feinstein told us. Then we found out that Senator Feinstein had had this letter from this constituent of hers for months, dating all the way back to the early summer ó and Dianne Feinstein, senator from California, sat on it and didnít do anything with it, presumably because the accuser didnít want anything done with it.I have to tell you, when I heard that, I said, ìWell, then, why send the letter?î If the accuser doesnít want to be named, if the accuser doesnít want to make an issue of it, if the accuser doesnít want to go forward, then why the hell send the letter to a United States senator, for crying out loud? But despite all that, we were told that she didnít want to pursuing anything. We all believed it! See, thatís the thing. Decent people believe what theyíre told no matter what. We ought not believe a single thing they say!Because if this woman did not want this taken any farther, then the Democrats are betraying her ó and I donít believe the Democrats are betraying her. I think she is part of a cabal doing everything they can to stop Kavanaugh or, if they canít stop him, to cast such a cloud. They want to delay the vote ítil after the midterms. The Senate might flip Democrat, which would change everything. This is what theyíre thinking.Now, thatís politics. That I can understand. Destroying somebody whoís notÖ? Just outright destroying, which is what they do. Anyway, after last Thursday learning that Kavanaughís accuser didnít want to go public, didnít want Senator Feinstein to pursue anything, we now learn that she had already scrubbed all of her social media so none of her partisan activities could be found. (interruption) What do you mean, ìWhat partisan activities?î Iíll tell you who she is.None of this means sheís not telling the truth. This is the thing. Nobody knows. Thatís whatís so dastardly about this. Nobody knows. ìKavanaugh Accuser Is [A Typical] Unhinged [Deranged] Liberal Professor who Former Students Describe as Dark, Mad, Scary and Troubled. Her name is Christine Blasey. She ìspent all weekendî shredding her online activities, Facebook and Twitter accounts and all this.She ìscores a 2.9 in competency from former students on the Rate My Professor website. The student reviews are brutal and suggest she has severe psychological problems.î She had already obtained the services of another radical left-wing Democrat Party lawyer, somebody named Katz. I didnít know the name when I first heard the name but when I saw this woman on TV, this womanís on TV constantly as a Democrat activist lawyer. Sheís already hired an ex-FBI agent to give her a lie detector test which the Washington Post claimed that she passed with flying colors.And she had arranged to have a counselor release notes of her sessions in 2012 where she finally divulged the trauma of this incident that happened in high school and has led to posttraumatic stress disorder and all. Now, why didnít any of this come out during the hearing? Feinstein knew about it. Why didnít any of this surface, particularly when you had Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski out there looking for any excuse whatsoever to vote against this guy? Letís be honest.They were looking for any excuse to vote ìno,î any #MeToo excuse, any sexist excuse, any pro-abortion excuse ó any excuse they could look for ó and there wasnít any. The left got so panicked they began to do things that offended Susan Collins, and she began to say so. Why didnít this stuff come out when there were two Republicans willing, two Republican women willing to vote against Kavanaugh? Why didnít this stuff surface then? And I have a theory. I have a theory.I think theyíre rolling the dice big time on this. Because what has to happen now is this woman has to come before the Senate committee and testify, which her lawyer and she herself are saying that sheís willing to do. But today, tomorrow? They have to be brought to town, they have to sit and they have to be interviewed. They have to testify this afternoon, tonight, or tomorrow. If they donít, if they refuse, then weíre gonna know whatís up here.If she refuses to come tell this story and unburden herself, if she refuses to help the United States Senate Judiciary Committee figure out just who it is thatís been nominated ó if sheís got this story and if itís the truth and she refuses to come here this week ó then weíre gonna know quite a bit about what the real motivation is, which we already do. And I think the Democrats and all of her sponsors are rolling the dice that thatís not gonna happen. I think theyíve waited ítil the last minute because they donít want this woman on public display, for whatever reasons.I think they fear that this outrageous charge would be seen for what it is. I think sheÖ I think theyíre afraid. I think the Democrats didnít bring this up any time before today, last week, because this is the only time it will work, when there isnít sufficient time to actually hear from her before any vote. And, by the way, right on schedule, here comes the loyal and devoted Jeff Flake ó the outgoing senator from Arizona ó claiming thereís no reason we should hurry into this vote.This guy has got Trump Hatred Syndrome just oozing out of every pore in his body and his epidermis. This guy is so governed by his hatred of Donald Trump that anything he can do to derail what Trump wants, he will do ó including participate in a bogus procedure to destroy a decent person. There isnít a soul in the world outside of this woman who has ever said anything even close to this about Brett Kavanaugh. The women who have worked with Kavanaugh have all lauded him in just the opposite terms.When this woman was made public in her allegations are made public, 65 went who went to high school with Kavanaugh and have worked with him immediately wrote a letter claiming all this had to be untrue. This canít be the guy they knew and know. This letter writer, this woman has to be confused, they said. Weíve got one woman the Democrats do not want anybody to see under oath, obviously, versus everybody else whoís ever known the man.And weíre on the verge of derailing a decent guy with an impeccable resume, with impeccable qualifications simply because the American left and the Democrat Party donít like him. And because of that, they now have to destroy him. Itís the only way they can keep him off the court is to literally destroy him. Even if they have to use lies and innuendo. So, once again, weíre faced with exactly what Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill was. The seriousness of the charge versus nature of the evidence. The nature of the evidence here is very thin. The seriousness of the charge, #MeToo movement, pretty big. So theyíve rolled the dice that theyíre gonna be able to accomplish this without any further testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Letís go to the phones and see what people want to weigh in about this.Weíll start in San Francisco. Jim, great to have you. Always love getting calls from out there. How are you doing, sir?CALLER: Iím the only one, Rush. (laughing) Iím the only conservative.RUSH: Ha-ha-ha! Youíre not that alone. You canít be that alone.CALLER: I fight the best fight that I can. But here, Rush, I really think Kavanaugh is done. Iíve been racking my mind through this and I donít see a situation, any scenario where it plays out in our favor and simply because all you gotta do is flip one Republican and then the other Democrats will fold, and then itís a 50-50 vote. I just canít imagine even an unproven ìhe said, she saidî in this era of #MeToo isnít gonna completely peel off at least one, maybe even two Democrat votes.Corker and Flake are there are indicating that theyíre gonna vote ìno,î and then you got Collins and Murkowski. I just donít see how itís gonna go. You flip one of them, all the Dems go. And Rush, I was gonna point out, you know, Republicans need to get in the mud and play hardball. I think these Republican senators still have this idea that theyíre the courtly gent, ìmy friend across the aisle,î those old rules still apply.RUSH: Some of them do. Some of them do. What youíre dealing with with Corker and Flake is sheer Trump hatred. Thatís whatís governing their behavior. They know exactly what theyíre doing. The personal animus, I couldnít believe ó and Iím really, you know, getting close to the edge when I say this. I couldnít believe what people allowed the McCain funeral to become for the same reason: This irrational hatred for Donald Trump, what heís done, what he means, the fact that he won. Thatís why Corker is doing what heís doing. Same thing with Flake. Flake couldnít even win reelection. Heís gone. Heís leaving. Collins is not gone yet, Jim. Collins is out criticizing the way the Democrats are doing this. Sheís got a bigger set than Jeff Flakeís got if you get my drift.CALLER: Republicans need to be getting down in the mud, and I tell you what, Rush. You know, they need to be using these same tactics. Where are Republicans? They should have been hiring private investigators to look at Mueller when he was in junior high school. Iíll bet the kid was a bully! You know, they should be looking at every single Democrat thatís up for election and going back to high school because thatís fair game now, and when things are peaceful with the Democrats, thatís when they need to be digging up dirt and smacking íem in the face with it.They need to keep punching a guy when heís on the ground until heís done and dead. Thatís the bottom line. The only one that knows this is Trump. Thatís the only Republican that knows what weíre up against and how to fight back. Heís been giving us how to do it for two years and Republicans just arenít catching on ícause theyíre naive littleÖ You know, they think themselves above this kind of stuff. Well, guess what? If you fight gentlemanly, youíre gonna get your butt kicked.RUSH: I agree with that, but I still donít think thatís whatís going on. I donít think theyíre that naive. I just think theyíre scared to death of the media. They live in Washington; thatís where the media is. I think theyíre afraid of what the mediaís gonna say about them next. They donít want to be Kavanaughíd. They donít want to be Borked. Theyíve all gotta get reelected. Probably a combination of both. I think the courtly, gentlemanly, ìI am a United States senator and there is decorum here and weÖîSure. Iím sure that they tell themselves theyíre doing the right thing by playing in that regard. But look, let me run one other mitigating factor by you. You say ó a lot of people agree with you ó letís go out and dig up some dirt on pick your name. Mueller? ìIíll bet he was a bully when he was in school! I wonder how many women accused him? I wonder how many women theyíve abused.î Iím not opposed to it, Iím just telling you itís gonna be ignored or covered up by the media. The media isnít gonna help you expose whatever it is you find. In fact, theyíre gonna set out and try to destroy you for daring to bring it up.CALLER: Well, you know what? They will. They will. But it doesnít matter. Itís open warfare. This is why Trump keeps doing what he was because he realizes this is the only way to fight. Trump, by the way, is the only guy the media canít ignore. When the president of the United States tweets something, they canít ignore that. So he kind of has the upper hand on it. But, yeah, youíre right. I mean, heís got all these things.You got the deep state, you got the lower courts lined up against you, youíve got the media lined up against you, the legislature. Every aspect is lined up against you. But playing it by the rules trying to appease them? They hate you anyway. Thereís nothing youíre gonna do to make them not like you. So you just have to fight. If we go down, I want to be the little mouse giving the finger to the eagle thatís about to eat me.RUSH: Right. (chuckles)CALLER: I donít want to be sitting hiding under a rock.RUSH: Yeah, I agree. I just donít think we have that many warriors in elected office on the Republican side. We just donít. But, you know, itís fascinating too. If you listen to Michael Moore right now, Michael Moore thinksÖ Now, this to me is fascinating psychologically. Michael Moore literally believes the Democrats are losing everything. Just because Trump won and continues to stay in office as far as Moore ó and I think this is true of a lot of Democrats, Jim.No matter how much they succeed with Kavanaugh, they still think theyíre losing ícause they havenít gotten rid of Trump. So Michael Moore says that he spent two hours with Steve Bannon. Stick with me on this ícause I want to get your reaction. Michael Moore thinks that he had a revelation talking to Steve Bannon. He said he asked Bannon, ìHow did you pull this off?ìYouíve got a genuine idiot ó or a guy that tries to come off as an idiot whoís never been in politics ó who wins the presidency. How did you guys do this?î Michael Moore said that Bannon said, ìThis is easy. You guys do pillow fights and we take head shots.î Now, Jim, do you think that Bannon is right? Do the Republicans take head shots? Do they go for head shots with people and the Democrats are out there just fighting pillow fights?CALLER: No. I think itís the reverse.RUSH: That was Michael Mooreís view. Michael Moore thinks the Democrats are a bunch of wusses, donít have the guts to fight Trump, and yet you and many of us think the same thing about our side.CALLER: I actuallyÖ This might surprise you, Rush, but I actually donít mind Michael Moore so much because he is what he is. He shows who he is, what heís about, and I think the guy genuinely is honest about his curiosity about Republicans. I mean, I disagree with everything he is about. But I actually kind of respect him a little bit because of his honesty. What I think óRUSH: I think youíre just falling for the fact that he wears baseball caps to make himself look like heís from Flint, Michigan.CALLER: Yeah. He occasionally comes through San Francisco too. But I just think that the Republicans, itís the duplicitous, sneaky Democrats, the ones like Dianne Feinstein, who plays this niceÖ You know, sheís from San Francisco. You know, I had a lot of respect for Dianne Feinstein as a middle-of-the-road liberal. For a lot years I had respect for her. I started losing it, you know, more recently. But itís the sneaky ones that we have to realize and theyíre not taking pillow shots. Theyíre taking head shots. And Republicans need to start not just taking head shots. They need to be kicking-in-the-nuts kind of shots.RUSH: Right.CALLER: They need to be getting down and dirty, into the mud, and I think they should start with Bob Mueller. I think that guyís a bully. My instincts, I bet you, are dead on. I bet that guy was absolutely a bully in high school ó and guess what, Rush? Anything puberty on is now fair game.RUSH: It would seem so, especially on the right. Okay, Jim. Iím really glad you called. I could continue this but I have to take a brief time-out. But just to reiterate, I find it fascinating that left-wing activists think their party is as big a bunch of wusses as we think ours are. Now, in their case itís all because they havenít been able to get rid of Trump and theyíre mad that no Democrat, nobody has found a way to stand up to Trump and make Trump stop what heís doing. So theyíre a bunch of wusses.We think our guys are a bunch of wusses for the reasons that you gave.Anyway, itís all fascinating.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: ìSen. Collins Criticizes Democratsí Handling of Christine Blasey Fordís AccusationsÖî Jeff Flake didnít and Corker didnít. Susan Collins, Senator Collins has suggested that they both show up and testify. Look, thatís the only way to deal with this. I mean, you might say, ìWhy should Kavanaugh? He already has! They didnít bring any of this up.î Nah, itís come up. She could beÖ There could be something to this. We canít reject it out of hand no matter (chuckles) what your common sense and your political instincts tell you.If sheís serious, get her up to that committee today. Get her there tonight. Get her there for testimony tomorrow. Kavanaugh will go. Heís already said heíll go anywhere, answer any question whatsoever. The White House is standing by him. So get her in there. Get the accuser in there. If the accuser refuses to show up before the committee vote, which is scheduled for Thursday, or was, then that will carry quite a message. If sheís unwilling to show up so that the vote can go off as planned, then this is all about delay.The delay they want to make ítil after the midterms ícause they believe theyíre gonna win the Senate, they believe theyíre gonna win the House, and they can stop Trump from nominating somebody that they donít want to confirm, i.e., somebody like Kavanaugh. If they win the House and Senate then theyíre gonna start on impeachment proceedings, and (in their dreams) are gonna get rid of Trump in six months. So thatís what this is about, and if this woman refusesÖHereís the thing to look at. If sheís got the goods, if she can prove irrefutably ó and Iím told, folks, that she canít even remember the exact date this happened. I got an email from a woman today who said that she was a victim of attempted rape in high school, college. She remembers everything about it. This is her point in the email. Thirty-five years ago, 40 years. She remembers everything about it like it was yesterday. Attempted rape is a traumatic, terrifying thing. You remember. But this woman canít pinpoint the year, the date. Sheís not sure. She gives a date range from what I understand.But ifÖ If sheís got incontrovertible evidence that could destroy the nomination, why wouldnít she want to be up there this past July? Why did they hold off on this? As Iíve said, I think the Democrats know that what they have here is probably not slam dunk for whatever reason. But if they think theyíve got whatever it takes to destroy this nomination, wouldnít she want to be here today or tonight or tomorrow and seal the guyís fate once and for all?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So Breitbart says today that Kavanaughís accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, wore one of those vagina hats at anti-Trump march. So sheís one of those. The legal adviser, her lawyer, Katz, Debra Katz, is a big-time Democrat donor and has spoken in defense of Clinton and Al Franken. So clearly the hypocrisy is running rampant. But this is politically a repeat of the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill scenario. Itís a hail Mary.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/14/pushing-back-against-all-the-lies/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 14, 2018RUSH: Well, the Democrats and the media wanted a destructive hurricane. Letís all admit it. They were hoping for disaster. They wanted it to validate their politics-based hysteria on something like the weather. See, a Category 5 hurricane would be seen as validation for global carbon taxes, massive regulatory control of the economy, and getting rid of Trump. You could blame Trump for a Category 5 hurricane. Thing is, Trumpís a Category 5 every day anyway, so what would be the big deal?JOHNNY DONOVAN: And now, from sunny south Florida, itís Open Line Friday!RUSH: ìMr. Limbaugh, donít you feel the slightest bit hesitant making these kinds of charges?î No, I donít, folks. Thereís no question about it! I even had a story from a website called Grabien News. The headline: ìMedia Politicize Florence, Blame Trump for Storms, Predict Mass Death.î Subheadline: ìTrump is ëactively making the problem worse.'î Subhead: Limbaugh assisting Trump making the problem worse.Trump and I both said to be complicit in Hurricane Florence because, you know why, Rachel? Because we donít agree with climate change, and since we donít agree with climate change having an impact on this, then we are responsible for people who may not be leaving. Oh. Thatís another thing. People who are not leaving have become a new target for the Drive-By Media. (laughing)Anyway, greetings. Itís Open Line Friday, and itís great to be back with you as we wrap up yet another sterling week of broadcast excellence. The telephone number is 800-282-2882 if you want to be on the program. Email address, ElRushbo@eibnet.us.Our official climatologist here at the EIB Network, Dr. Roy Spencer, has a great column in USA Today today pointing out that the only thing affecting the hurricane is weather. That the hurricane is weather, in fact, and that there are meteorological explanations for everything thatís happening. There are statistics galore that indicate the severity. In fact, the 36 ó ready for this? ó the 36 most damaging, strongest storms since 1940 have decreased in intensity while at the same time we have been told they should be increasing in intensity because we are polluting our atmosphere with CO2s, creating the greenhouse effect.Itís like pretty much everything else. Iím approaching that point where I donít know what to do about this. Everything theyíre saying is not true. Pretty much everything they pass off as fact isnít true. What do you do with this? How do you reach people who are soaking all this up and accepting it and believing it? I mean, itís been the challenge of this program since it began. Itís been the challenge of conservative media since 30 years ago.But as they go on, they are getting even more extreme, less connected to the truth. And itís almost on purpose. Itís as though they know the truth is damaging to their assertions. And when it comes to climate change, I need to make this point again. The storms are decreasing in intensity. They are occurring less frequently. I mean, we went 10 years without a major hurricane hitting the United States coastline. Weíve had global temperatures declining. Why arenít they claiming credit for this?Theyíve been out there demanding policies, and there have been policies implemented because of their demands. Why arenít they claiming credit for this progress? Why arenít they claiming credit? Why instead do they want to lie? Why do they have to lie about things that are demonstrably not true? And the answer to that is politics.The Democrats today want us to believe that Brett Kavanaugh was a high school bully. At age 17, he locked a girl in a room that she was able to get out of. When he was 17. This is something like 35 years ago. The Democrats are making fools of themselves except the Drive-By Media is joining them in this effort to destroy Kavanaugh. It is almost a redux of the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas scenario.So the media, the Democrats want you to believe that Brett Kavanaugh and Mitt Romney also, high school bullies. Remember they ran a story on Romney that he beat up some kid at a prep school because he didnít like his hairstyle or some such thing. I donít remember what it was. Meanwhile, Democrats who have actually murdered and sexually abused women are celebrated and lifted to the top of the Democrat star ranks, Teddy Kennedy and Bill Clinton.Kavanaugh locks a girl in high school in a room? How many of you have not pulled high school pranks? If I spent some time here detailing my high school pranks ó weíve done this over the years, but itís been many, many moons since I have described some of the things I did. I loved it. In fact, I took some of those pranks to the radio as a struggling young disc jockey way back in the early days. I mean, this is just absurd. I feel like itís crazy to even address this stuff and try to refute it point by point because it feels ó I donít know ó worthless. Because it keeps happening.Thereís not a single thing to stop these people from their abject lies. Thereís another example out there today. Nikki Haley, as you know, is our ambassador to the United Nations. When Susan Rice was our ambassador to the United Nations, she lived in the 35th floor, 50th floor, whatever, way up there in the Waldorf Towers. Now, for those of you who donít know, the Waldorf ìHysteriaî hotel on Park Avenue is one of New Yorkís greatest of all time.And right next to it, in fact part of it, is something called Waldorf Towers. They are apartments, condominiums that you can rent as a home for any length of time that you want. They routinely go for something like $135,000 a week, sometimes, depending on the size, $135,000 a month. Thatís where Susan Rice lived. Susan Rice lived at Waldorf Towers. The federal government paid an exorbitant amount of money for her to live there. Many actors who are doing stints on Broadway stay there.I was at Waldorf Towers one day. I had a meeting up there, believe it or not, with CNN people way, way back. And the head honcho at CNN happened to be staying there. So thatís where I had to go for a meeting with CNN. I come out of the meeting room ó well, the apartment, and thereís Tom Selleck. Tom Selleck is staying there. He was playing somebody on Broadway. So he stops, says hi, says, ìFancy seeing you here.î I said, ìI could say the same thing.î It was 4 oíclock in the afternoon, he was on the way to his gig on Broadway.Anyway, the point is that while Susan Rice was living there, they ordered something like 75,000 or $50,000 of new drapes and $35,000 of motors to open and close them! But they didnít happen to arrive and be installed until Nikki Haley moved in, so Nikki Haley is being blamed.And even that little Camera Hogg kid from the school down in Parkland, the little Camera Hogg kidís out there tweeting that she is making irresponsible appropriations while people are being shot and while people are starving and while people are being destroyed by hurricanes and so forth. The story has been corrected.The truth of the story is out there that Obamaís administration is the one that ordered the exorbitant drapes and was paying the exorbitant price. Nikki Haleyís saying her rent is nowhere near what the Obama Regime was paying for Susan Rice, and yet itís all over the media. The media knows the truth and refuses to withdraw it. The media refuses to correct it. Theyíre running the story that Nikki Haley and Trump ordered this massively expensive set of drapes and motors to open and close them when it all happened during the Obama administration!They didnít even know it.Nikki Haley and her crew didnít even know it ítil the installation crew shows up one day and said, ìOkay, we got these curtains now; itís time to put them in.î What does that say about it that you order curtains and two years later they show up to be installed? Anyway, the truth is that Nikki Haley had nothing to do with the expenditure. She didnít even know anything about it. And everybody reporting this knows that they are lying through their teeth, that this is a Trump-Nikki Haley exorbitance and that it illustrates how they donít care about the little guy.In the midst of this hurricane devastating people, Nikki Haley saw fit to install 55- or 75- (or whatever it is) thousand-dollar curtains in her temporary home ícause nobody stays at Waldorf Towers. Well, I guess there are people that live there. I donít know. Theyíre basically apartment rentals, butÖ (interruption) Are they worth a hundred thousandÖ? Well, itís like anything else. Itís where it is. Itís Waldorf Towers. Thereís nothing in there that sets it apart from any other luxurious place. I mean, the price is notÖ Not that I recall, anyway.Hell, you know, there are New York businesses that keep apartments at Waldorf Towers for visiting clients from out of town who want ìcompany.î Ahem. Ahem. Waldorf Towers. You have your standingÖ I was offered one once way back when I first became an investor. (interruption) Oh, yeah. Anyway, thatís just one of many examples, and here youíve got Donald Trump fighting every day pushing back against all this. And as he pushes back, they ratchet up the fact that heís the one lying and canít tell the truth.This ridiculous controversy over number of people died in the aftermath of the Puerto Rico hurricane? This is classic! This is pure politics. We have a computer model used by experts at George Washington University claiming 3,000 people died in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. There isnít any evidence of it. Itís just a bunch of experts and their computer models, and Trump is accusing them of making it up, of a nobody that isnít real, that the Democrats are behind it to make him look bad. Heís exactly right.But now, because this involves Puerto Rico, youíve got down here in FloridaÖ Youíve got Rick Scott whoís running for the Senate, Ron DeSantis running for governor. Theyíre having to distance themselves from Trump on his claim here that heís not responsible for 3,000 people dying. Thatís what the Democrats and the media are saying, that Trump didnít care enough, didnít do enough after the hurricane in Puerto Rico; so 3,000 people died because Trump doesnít care. Trumpís saying, ìThe hell with these peopling! Iím not gonna sit here.îItís standard operating procedure for him. You lie about him and he pushes back. Well, because of a lot of Puerto Rican residents in Florida ó Puerto Rican people in Florida and friends of Puerto Ricans here ó Ron DeSantis running for governor and Rick Scott running for the Senate have had to kind of distance themselves from Trump on this. Not because they disagree with him, but because the media is hammering this, and these guys canít take the chance.Theyíre gonna have to go with the flow, theyíre gonna have to go with what the conventional wisdom is, and that is that 3,000 people died in Puerto Rico ó when they didnít ó and that Trump may be responsible. So these guys have to distance themselves just to show the Puerto Rican voters here in Florida that theyíre not anti-Puerto Rico. Just absurd. Just make these claims, 3,000 people afterÖ? Can somebody name me a single hurricane where 3,000 people died?(interruption) Galveston, Texas. When was that? It was 1900. I think thereís another hurricane where 7,000 people died way back. You do have to go back 75 years where we didnít have nearly the kind of warning systems that we have today to get people out of there. We didnít have nearly the kind of tech recovery, any number of things. ìWell, they didnít in Puerto Rico, either, Rush, because Trump didnít care. Trump didnít care.î We were the only nation that did go down there. Weíre the only ones that did try to assist. So the DemocratsÖWhen I mentioned earlierÖ You know, I hate doing this. I really do because I know how it sounds to some people. I told you earlier in the week this storm was not going to hit as it was predicted to, not because of anything other than thatís the way it always is. Itís tough to predict these things far out. As a hurricane expert here, there are only two of them in my memory since 1997 that, if they were forecast to hit you say Category 3 or 4, they did. Most of them become much weaker where they get where theyíre going to hit.And the track changes constantly. You canít deny that earlier this week, ìItís Category 4! Maybe Category 5!î We even had a guy saying it was gonna be so bad, we may need to have a new category, Category 6, because of Trump and because he doesnít believe in climate change. And when I happened to remind people, ìThereís a good chance this thing might weaken. Thereís a good chance itís not gonna go where they say right now,î I was lambasted all over TV as the irresponsible, because I was not following the mandated government-speak on what the hurricane was gonna do.Meanwhile, everybody else in the Drive-Bys? It was sick. They were excited by it because of the politics of everything, because everything has been politicized. This ongoing, expanding hatred (which is just an outright poison) that they have for Trump is causing them to distort what is already a dangerous level of hatred that they harbor. The hatredís fully on display in this Kavanaugh circumstance. Even Ruth ìBuzziî Ginsburg has essentially said this is enough. You know, she loved Antonin Scalia. He loved her.They spent New Yearís Eve together. They liked opera. It was odd to a lot of people, but they were best buds. She said (paraphrased), ìYou know, he was confirmed 98-nothing. Thatís the way it always should be.î She was confirmed by a similar high number. Democrat numbers when theyíre nominated generally get confirmed by a decent number. Pretty much every Republican nominee they try to destroy, try to ruin. Clarence Thomas, Robert Bork, Kavanaugh. They tried to destroy Alito. They tried to do some damage to Roberts but they didnít have much success there.But this business with Kavanaugh? he locked a girl in a room in high school, 35 years ago, 17-year-old and she got out? How seriously could it have been? Heís categorically denying it, by the way. Dianne Feinsteinís had this letter from this anonymous studied all these years, didnít do anything about it. Yeah, months. Oh, and the FBI has declined to investigate (chuckling) because thereís nothing to investigate. But theyíre trying to create this gigantic cloud.The left is also so upset they have not been able to move Susan Collins into voting ìno,î that they sent her a giant cardboard cutout of male genitalia. Three-foot-long male genitalia cardboard cutout to try to intimidate her into voting against Kavanaugh and claimÖ (interruption) Well, Iíll tell you what do you mean, ìWhatís the symbolism of it?î The symbolism youíve got a three-foot-long cardboard cutout of male genitalia.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Minor correction. I misspoke when I said that there had been no major hurricanes in 10 years. I meant in a 10-year period. We had two major hurricanes last year, Harvey and Irma. It was 2006 through 2016, 11 years that we had no Category 3 or greater hurricanes striking land in the United States. In 2016, right in the middle of massive climate change, massive carbon dioxide pollution, and all that. My point is, why not take credit for their policies working instead of getting mad? And the answer is politics.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/09/seething-with-jealousy-bill-and-hillary-launch-stadium-tour/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 9, 2018RUSH: Have you ever heard, ladies and gentlemen, that the Clintons are going to start a massive stadium tour? Bill and Hilary want to get in on all this Trump action. Now, Iíve been wondering how long it was gonna be until somebody in the Democrat Party tried this. Trumpís rallies dating back to the 2016 campaignÖDo not doubt me on this, either.The Democrats and the media publicly acted unconcerned, uninterested, and would always say a variation of, ìYou canít judge voter interest on the basis of rallies! You canít predict how people are gonna vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies! These Trump rallies are not telling us anything. It doesnít mean anything. These are just rabid people upset with their lives, and they think Trump Iím gonna kick all the people out of the country they donít like. Itís nothing. Itís not anywhere near representative of the population.îThis is what they all said at every Trump rally. PrivatelyÖ Do not doubt me. Privately they were jealous as they could be, and they were seething because thereís not a one of them on the Democrat side who could come anywhere close to equaling that kind of excitement, that kind of loyalty, and those size crowds. Obama couldnít do it. Not in 2016. Hillary couldnít do it ever! But certainly not in 2016. She couldnít draw flies to her book-signing ceremonies!Hillary Clinton couldnít draw a crowd anywhere! People knew she might not be able to stand up for a full 25 minutes without some aide coming out to prop her up by the elbows. But seriously, I guarantee you they were looking those crowds, they were looking at those Trump rallies, and they would never say so publicly, but they were scared to death by íem. They would never say so publicly. They would never admit it publicly. They would say just the opposite.But theyíre human beings, and any time anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty, that equals jealousy and envy and anger and all things that attach to jealousy and envy. They hated Trump to begin with. And the fact that Trump was turning everything they believed in upside down, the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldnít, just in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign, interested in the candidacy.And those rallies, 20,000, 15, 25,000, as many people lined up outside who couldnít get in, wanted to get in. Trump with his airplane perfectly placed so that ìTrumpî in giant letters on the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas. So Iíve been wondering how long itís gonna be before somebody on the Democrat side triest to get in on this action. And I always thoughtÖYou know who I thought it would be that would make the first stab at trying it? Joe Biden. I really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy to try to replicate this. Then I thought maybe Michelle (My Belle) Obama. But then I thought, ìNo, theyíve got too much to lose if it doesnít work.î Maybe Kamala Harris. MaybeÖ But somebodyís gonna do this. Somebodyís got to try it. Theyíve got to be able to showÖ The Democrats are thinking, theyíve gotta show that thereís as much excitement, as much loyalty, as much attention as Trump can draw.Up ítil now, nobody on the Democrat side has even given it a prayer. Until the Clintons. The Daily Wire has the story: ìWashington power couple, Bill and Hillary Clinton, announced Monday that theyíre embarking on a nationwide ëstadium tour,í bringing their stage show to 13 cities this fall. ëAn Evening with President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham ClintoníÖî Thatís the actual title of the show.It ìwill feature the pair sharing ëstories and inspiring anecdotes that shaped their historic careers in public service, while also discussing issues of the day and looking toward the futureÖí The tour, sponsored by Live Nation (which is also hosting a stadium tour for former First Lady Michelle Obama), begins in Las Vegas on Sunday, November 18 ó after the midterm elections ó and criss-crosses the country, ending in Los Angeles next April. Tickets go on sale Friday, October 12, but they arenít cheap.ìIf you want to see the Clintonsí ëjoint speaking tourí at the Park Theater in Las Vegas, for example, the cheapest seats will run you just a little over $70 each. Where the pair are more in demand, like Boston, seats start at $120 and can cost as much as $745.50. The tour, oddly enough, will not make stops in Wisconsin, an interesting oversight given Hillary Clintonís failed presidential campaign plan also missed the state. Hillary will, however, finally visit Pennsylvania and Michigan.î Iím telling you whatís going on here.Theyíre seething with jealousy. Bill and Hillary, on those rare moments when theyíre home at the same time and together, they sit there, and they look at these Trump ralliesÖ Donít doubt me. They do. They look at íem, they watch them, and they just sit there and they say to each other (impression), ìUh, I canít believe it. I justÖ. Hillary, I canítÖ I canít. You know, I thought we were popular back in the 90s, and we couldnít draw crowds like this if weíd ever tried to.ìWe could have done that. Hell, we could have done it better than Trumpís. Can you believe this?î And they start talking about getting in on it and doing their own stadium tour. So they call Live Nation, which is a rock music promo agency and ticket seller and so forth. Does anybody thinkÖ? Including on the Democrat side, is anybody excited about this? (interruption) You think the Democrat Partyís excited? The Democrat PartyÖOh, folks, I am here to tell you this is the last thing they want is Hillary and Bill Clinton running around as the presumed front-runners for 2020, ícause thatís what this is about. They donít want the Clintons any more to be the face of this party. They just got through with this Kavanaugh business and now the Clintons are gonna head out there, Mr. and Mrs. Bimbo Eruption? I wonder if this show will feature James Carville running across the stage or through the audience trailing a hundred-dollar bill and asking any interested women to meet Bill backstage after the show.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/08/in-a-sane-world-democrats-would-suffer-a-landslide-defeat/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 8, 2018RUSH: One thing to keep in mind, folks, when you hear any leftist talking about ìwhitenessî or ìwhite privilege,î what that translates to is power.Remember what the American left is ó and it really serves to understand this. The American left today despises America as founded, and this may be a bit of a simplification, but I do this in order to communicate and be understood. At its very essence, the modern-day American left ó as taught and educated over the past two generations through middle school, high school, and college ó has been taught to hate America because America is unjust from our founding days, because it was founded by white men.White men founded a place for themselves and excluded everybody else, and everybody else has been getting the short end of the stick for over 200-plus years. Only now is the awareness and sensitivity to this being realized. Only now are the victims of this white privilege, of this white power ó only now ó are they standing up and demanding to be heard. Only now are they rising up in righteous indignation and demanding fairness and redress.
And the only way that can happen is for the white power structure of white privilege to be destroyed and replaced by a coalition of all of those who have been victimized, segregated, punished, mistreated, abused, what have you, by them reclaiming ó or not reclaiming, but claiming ó what is justly theirs, and that is America and its political systems. And thatís what young people have been taught.Now, as evidenced by that column I read by Alexis Grenell ó or any other of these militant feminists, militant leftists ó it is essentially the product of the classroom and the campus which has now grown up and matured and become the, quote-unquote, ìmainstreamî of the Democrat Party. This angry, agitated base of people that spends the sum total of every day in a permanent state of rage and anger. In their minds, they are powerless within American systems to fix anything, because white privilege has a death grip on every institution, on every election, on everything that matters.They have a death grip on the money. They have a death grip on the economy. They have a death grip on everything. And in releasing this death grip, they must get violent and they must get in your face. People are taught this way. Hatred and rage and anger have to be taught or inspired or mobilized. You donít come out of the womb this way! Everybody comes out of the womb smiling and happy.Now, when a baby makes a mess of itself in a diaper, yeah, thereís anger. But you get my point here. The natural state of a human being is not rage and anger. The natural state of humanity is not that as epitomized by the Democrat Party. Yet that has become the Democrat Party. I firmly believe ó and I said this Friday, and even if it makes me sound naive, Iím gonna say it again. In a sane world, in a decent and just country, the actions of the American left just in the past two years would result in the biggest landslide electoral defeat of the Democrat Partyís lifetime.There is not a single thing in a decent and just country that the American left, that the Democrat Party has done by virtue of its behavior that warrants the stamp of approval of winning elections. Yet they win them within their closely contained bases, districts, and states ó their enclaves ó which is actually a very small portion of this country in terms of square mileage. Itís population centers of the big cities on the coasts and in the Great Lakes.Hereís theÖ Itís not a dirty little secret, but itís something to always keep in mind. And, frankly, I was happy watching the news over the weekend to hear a number of people on our side making this point because itís a point thatís been true for as long as I have been doing this program and longer. We say constantly that the left uses the courts to act as insurance policies against losing elections, that the left cannot succeed in implementing its agenda nationwide except via the courts, and thatís why the courts are so important, and thatís why the courtsÖLiberal Democrat presidents have stacked as many of the federal courts, federal appellate courts as they can with leftist-activist judges, not just plain old, simple judges who rule on the law. And there is a dirty little secret behind this, folks. The Democrats simply do not have the numbers in the country to pass their agenda in Congress. They do not have the numbers to implement and pass their agenda legislatively. In other words, they cannot get their beliefs, their ideas passed as laws in America.They have to rely on activist judges to do it. Now, you might be say, ìWell, Rush, Iíve heard you say that before. Nothing new there.î Well, there nothing new about it, but particularly its relevance, its power and its importance has been magnified in this current Kavanaugh fight and explains in one way why this is so important to them. They are, in their minds, on the verge of losing the highest court in the land. Theyíre on the verge of losing the ability to have the highest court in the land rubber stamp their policies.If you go down and look at leftist issue by leftist issue ó these issues theyíve roiled our culture, turned our culture upside down ó you wonít find any of them that have been passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare. Abortion? The American people havenít decided that. That was forced on the American people by a leftist, activist judge and a majority on the Supreme Court.Any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this ìwhite power structureî that the left so despises and so hates that they cannot beat, they cannot win. They cannot do this legislatively. They need activist judges nominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on everybody! This is the point. What they believe in, the ideas they have must be forced on the rest of us if they are to happen. They cannot withstand legislative tests!Itís the same reason why every Democrat president, up to and including Obama, never tells the truth about their agenda. They would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do. If Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was gonna end up and how much it was gonna cost you and how much you deserved to pay for it because youíve been getting a free ride all these yearsÖ If Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what climate change was gonna cost you or anything, he would have never been elected.And no Democrat ever would be. They routinely soft sell what they really believe. They do not imagine out and advocate socialism or communism in presidential campaigns. They will do it, as is the case of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, whose lunacy is on display in a leftist district in New York is harmless. But you put her on a national ticket somewhere and she kills it. We have not lost this country, and we have not lost that which can be traced directly back to our founding.But the left wants everybody to believe that that founding and everything traceable back to it is unjust, unfair, that it is also racist and sexist and misogynistic and all these other things that are despicable. ìWe must do away with it!î They donít have the ability to win any of these issues legislatively. Now, you leftists can get mad at me all you want out there, but you cannot refute this. Everything they want ó everything they have achieved outside of Obamacare ó has been forced on the country.The country has been bludgeoned into accepting it. The country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way. And if you donít look the other way and if you fight it, then what do they do? They sue you, they try to ruin you, or they bully you or they harass you or what have you. This is not the behavior that does win things legislatively, and yet the Democrats firmly believe that all of this is going to lead to this gigantic blue wave. I donít careÖ Even today there are links all over the Drudge Report where if you click on íem, youíre gonna find a story saying, ìYep. Itís over!ìDemocrats win and win big ó and even the Republicans think so.î AP has íem. Reuters has íem. New York Times, CNN. It doesnít matter where you go. Thereís always gonna be a story where Republicans agree itís over. ìThe Republicans deathly afraid! Republicans scared to death! No way they can resist the coming the blue wave.î Sorry. I donít buy it. It may happen; I donít buy it. I donít trust anything I see in the news anymore, and I certainly donít trust a bunch of polling data, given what fallacies existed in both the news and polling leading up to 2016.Here is a story of a website called the Babylon Bee. ìDemocrats Shudder At Idea Of Having To Legislate Through Congress Should Supreme Court Lean Right.î I donít know if this site is legitimate or not. If itís a hoax site, what theyíre doing is satire on the truth, because it absolutely is the case. They are petrified of Kavanaugh being on the court simply because of the shift in the court that it represents. But it is undeniable, folks. Itís factual. Itís right in front of us.They have not been able to succeed implementing the leftist, socialist, communist agenda via the United States Congress. They can do it in their state legislatures; I give you places like California and so forth. They havenít been able to do it nationwide. It has to be forced. And of course for that to work ó for the use of force to work ó you have to cave to it. You have to cave to the bullying, which has happened on gay marriage; itís happened on transgender bathroom issues.Itís happened on every oddball leftist cultural demand out there. They count on everybody caving. They count on everybody suing for peace, until Donald Trump came along. Donald Trump doesnít cave, he doesnít sue for peace, and he doesnít cower to them. He calls them out. It makes perfect sense they would despise Donald Trump. It would make perfect sense if they feared Donald Trump. It makes perfect sense that they hate him. He refuses to play ball. Look at what theyíve attempted to force on the country with this whole Russian collusion thing.Trump-Russia collusion? Thatís a classic illustration of the left attempting to force what they want people to think happened on the American people using everything in their arsenal. They have the media. They have the deep state. They had Never Trumpers on the Republican side. They had all kinds of allies! They had a special counsel with an eliminated budget, 16 or 17 Trump-hating lawyers/investigators ó and still nothing! Because there has been pushback.When there is pushback on the left, they will fail. They can fail. They have gotten accustomed to there being no pushback. Theyíve gotten accustomed to Republicans being afraid of them and afraid of the media. Itís this pushback ó Trump having the audacity to run and the audacity to win then the audacity to actually do what he said he was gonna do in utter defiance of all these people. Itís rendering them unbalanced and insane.By the way, Paul Sperry (who writes columns at the New York Post and other places), tweeted yesterday afternoon at 2:06 p.m.: ìWashington Post national security correspondent Greg Miller spent the last 2 years writing a book on Trump and Russia, and yet he found no evidence that Trump or any member of his campaign conspired with Russia to hack the election. Zip. Zero. Zilch.î Nada! You wonít hear about this. I donít know if this guy is bragging or talking about it.But a Washington Post correspondent spent the last two years writing the book on Trump-Russia collusion, and thereís a problem. He canít find a shred of evidence that anybody within any Trump circle or Trump himself had anything to do with Russia at any time for any reason during the campaign. None! Stop and think of all of the abject lies the left forces on this country via, supposedly, legitimate news stories each and every day. Itís nothing but the use of force. The use of force flooding the zone because they do not have facts on their side.They do not have majorities on their side, and they know it, which is why their reliance on the courts is so strong. Let me take a brief timeout. Iím just telling you, folks, if everything were just and decent here, these people would receive the biggest electoral punishment in the history of the Democrat Party in November. For all of the grief, the misery, the lies, the destruction ó the attempted overthrowing of all of these things that make America great ó they should be punished with minority status so low that it would take íem decades to get it back.Thatís what ought to happen.I know itís not going to.Thatís what should happen.Thatís what they deserve.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The Babylon Bee is a conservative satire site. Iím being inundated with people informing me that itís not only great, that itís Christian, and itís filled with people of white privilege. So we heartily endorse it, the Babylon Bee. Anyway, their point proves my point about humor and satire. For it to be true and funny, it must have an element of truth in it. And it does. The Democrat Party is very much aware that they cannot and do not implement their beliefs via Congress.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Look, Iíll go so far even in my continuing attempts to be pervasive on the point Iím trying to make. I donít think Democrats care a whit about sexual assault, folks. I donít think they care a whit about it. It was just the most convenient way of attacking and getting rid of Kavanaugh. There are too many Democrats who commit sexual assault that they never complain about for the Democrats to really care about it. Bob Menendez, senator in New Jersey, was caught and went to trial over having sex with some underage women in the Dominican Republic.Heís got a 10-point reelection lead.Democrats donít care about that. Look at Bill Clinton, Ted Kennedy, any number of Democrats that you can point out. Theyíve had their sacrificial lambs like Harvey Weinstein. But they donít get rid of too many actual elected political people unless they are convinced that getting rid of them isnít gonna hurt them. But they stand by the ones they think they need. But Kavanaugh was not even about sexual assault, folks. That was just the hook. That was just the train they decided to ride to derailing the nomination.Anyway, Derek in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. You are up. Great to have you, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hey, Rush. So at the beginning of your show, you had a rhetorical question about do the Democrats really believe in this new tactic with the mob. And, I mean, the Democrats, theyíre an insurgency. Theyíve become a political insurgency. And, as you know, when insurgencies are defeated, they just change tactics. And the new tactic, you know, they employed with Judge Kavanaugh with Christine Blasey Ford, they had a twofer. They had someone that not only educates our youth, but they had someone that was willing on put a suicide vest for íem. Now, I just think that this is the new battlefront, and thankfully we have Trump who can ó who has ó put some steel in the spine of Republicans.RUSH: Well, true. True. (sigh) But maybe Iím silly for trying to force this issue. But let me just ask you point-blank, all right? You have talked and are willing to address the issue. Do you think that this ìinsurgency,î as youíve described it, which is this behavior that weíve seen the last two weeksÖ? Do you think that kind of behavior, which was widely publicizedÖ? The Democrats loved it. The media loved it. They tried to make heroes out of these people. They didnít try to hold them back.When they wanted to disrupt the Senate vote, they disrupted the Senate vote. When they wanted get in the halls of the Russell Senate Office Building, they did so. They got in elevators. They shouted these people down. The Democrats have not once called out that activity. Theyíve never once told that side, their side, to stand down. Do you think the American public watching that is going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it, or do you think the American public doesnít care one way or the other and doesnít even really notice it?CALLER: I think itís largely gonna be turned off, but like you said, theyíve completely changed their base now. Theyíve given up on the working blue-collar class, and theyíre now trying their hand to see if they can somehow increase the numbers with women on these types of issues. But I think largely that the American people are gonna be turned off, and I think itís all gonna come down to whoís able to get out the votes in a month. But that has no bearing on 2020.RUSH: Okay, this is my point. I donít think, given what weíve seen the last two weeksÖ Among people in the public who watched it, I donít think the Republicans need to do any get-out-the-vote. This was it! In my sane and just world, the Democrats just succeeded in getting Republican turnout larger than itís ever been for a midterm. I know Iím probably wrong about that. But thatís how I look at it, thatís how it ought to be, and Iím the king of books titled The Way Things Ought to Be.It ought to be that people were outraged by this! It ought to be that people canít wait to go punish this bunch of scum for the way they have treated this country the past two weeks alone! The Republicans ought not have to spend a dime getting out the vote based on this. But I know thatís not the reality. Itís kind of frustrating to me, but thatís the case.CALLER: Right.RUSH: Democrats think that theyíre gonna have turnout here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election. Democrats think they own the whole country agrees, except they really donít. They know they donít have enough Americans to win legislative battles. But they think that theyíre gonna be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is. And theyíve got news stories predicting that very thing. So people are gonna be reading it. People gonna be reading Republicans donít have a chance.CALLER: (silence)RUSH: You may reply.CALLER: No. I agree. And I think they energizeÖ I think they energized the base and they did exactly what need to be done. And I think that this is the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago that the event hadnít happened. And with 29 days left, it happened.RUSH: True. Yeah. When I said, ìThe events are gonna shape the midterms hadnít happenedî 30 days ago, I was exactly right. And there are some people saying that this is gonna be forgotten by the time the election comes around. A lot of people. I saw íem on Fox today. A lot of learned pundits and commentators, ìAw, this is gonna be so old by then!î I actually heard a couple people say, ìThe things that people are gonna vote on probably havenít happened yet.î(chuckling) I just had to chuckle. Now, I can see with the passage of time. You cannot maintain this uber-passion for long. Nobody can! (interruption) Well, but weíre talking aboutÖ Iím talking about reasonable people. Iím saying itís understandable to me that some passion on our side is going to fade. Thereís still a month to go! The other side? They have been chomping at the bit since election night 2016, and theyíre only getting more enraged.  "

He hasÖ Iíve never seen him this animated. Iíve never seen the Turtle this animated. This week, the Turtle and Grassley have been fit to be tied. Grassley still is. Grassley sent a letter late last night. Grassley sent his letter at 4 a.m. today toÖ I guess he sent it to Schumer, he might have sent it to Feinstein, and in this letter he calls out Mazie Hirono, the senator from Hawaii, and Feinstein by name. Let me read just a portion of Grassleyís letter.ìIndeed, if the evidence supported your clientís allegations, you surely would produce it as quickly as you could. But you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate. In doing so, you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr. Fordís allegations. I donít know what other inference we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr. Fordís allegations in quite the way you have claimed.îThis is the polygraph heís talking about, the notes with the polygraph, and the therapist notes. Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced those, even though Blasey Ford admitted that she took a lie detector ó well, her lawyers did ó and that she had seen a therapist. And Grassleyís been asking for that evidence, and Feinstein and the Democrats have not produced it. Heís saying, ìYou have repeatedly refused to produce this, and in doing so, youíre preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr. Fordís allegations.îShe passed a lie detector? We want to see it!They wonít let him see it.ìI donít know what other inference we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support [her] allegations in quite the way you have claimed.î Itís a reasonable thing to say. Theyíre out there saying she took a lie detector, that she passed a lie detector, that she told all these details to her therapist. Well, letís see that stuff! And they wonít produce it!Grassleyís saying: You must have something to hide.Then, he writes, ìI urge you once again, now for the third time in writing, to turn over the therapy notes, polygraph materials, and communications with the Washington Post that Dr. Ford has relied upon as evidence. In addition to the evidence I requested in my October 2 letter, in light of recently uncovered information, please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect communication between Dr. Ford or her representatives and any of the following:ì(1) U.S. senators or their staffs, particularly the offices of Senators Feinstein and HironoÖ (2)the alleged witnesses identified by Dr. Ford (Leland Keyser, Mark Judge, Patrick ëP. J.í Smythe); and (3) Debbie Ramirez, Julie Swetnick, or their representatives.î What Grassleyís getting at here is: How much consultation have you had with this witness? Senator Feinstein, Senator Hirono, how much time have you spent with this witness discussing her testimony or coaching her or whatever?I mean, heís loaded for bear. This is the kind of collegiality violation ó and I shouldnít call it that. This is the kind of decorum that you donít see broken. Senators donít challenge each other. They donít call each other out. Itís almostÖ Itís Senate rules. And Grassley yesterday during a joint Republican press conferenceÖHe kept running back to the microphone to rip into these media people as using bias and so forth. In fact, grab audio sound bite No. 5. This wasÖ I donít know if this was at a press conference or not. It may be exactly what I saw, but it is an example of Grassley with his finger on the pulse here. This isÖ Nah, itís not what Iíve seen. This is this morning in Washington. But letís listen to it.GRASSLEY: What we have learned is the ìresistanceî that has existed since the day after the November 2016 election is centered right here on Capitol Hill. They have encouraged mob rule! When you hear things about ìget in their face,î bother people at every restaurant where you can find a cabinet member? These are coming from public servants! They ought to set an example of civility in American society, and itís been made worse by what has happened to Judge Kavanaugh. I hope we can say ìnoî to mob rule by voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh. I yield the floor.RUSH: That was during his Senate floor remarks today in favor of Kavanaugh. He was singling out, by the way, Maxine Waters for promoting this, as he called it, ìresistance.î But heís calling them out here and chastising them for encouraging mob rule and that the ìresistanceî leadership is actually right here on Capitol Hill! And heís right! The leadership of the resistance is the Democrat Party. The resistance is over at the Democrat National Committee and in various Senate offices and offices of Congress ó members of the House and so forth.Iíve never seen this before! Iíve never seen these guys on our side call out the Democrats like this. I mean, theyíre fit to be tied.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/04/my-brothers-new-book-will-whet-your-appetite-for-the-bible/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 4, 2018RUSH: Hey, folks, I beg your indulgence here for just a brief moment. I want to talk about my brotherís new book, and, if I donít make time to do it, there isnít gonna be a good time. I donít want toÖ (sigh) There isnít gonna be a time to break topic for the next three or four days, and his book just came out, and I want to ó if youíll indulge me ó just tell you a little bit about it. Itís called Jesus Is Risen, and itís about Paul and the early church. And itís now available anywhere you get books. Itís on Amazon. Itís at Apple, iBooks, Barnes & Noble. Thereís an e-book version and all that.Now, my brother is devout. He is a devout Christian and is an evangelist in the sense that he spreads the Word. He wants everybody to know it, to understand Christianity, and itíd be great in his opinion if everybody accepted it because it would make for a much better culture and society. So what heís doneÖ He knows the Bible is an intimidating thing to read for people who havenít read it. Thereís the Old Testament and New Testament, and where do you start?And then which version do you get to even be able to understand what youíre reading? And how do you follow it and so forth? So what heís done in this book and a couple previous ones is almost like a primer. It is his telling of some of the key elements and stories of the Bible to whet your appetite for it, to make you curious, to get you interested in wanting to read the Bible. Every devout Christian thinks the Bible is the key, and the more people that read it and understand obviously the better.Now, Christianity was originally confined to a very small circle of people in Jerusalem, and it went from a small, little movement to the worldís most popular religion. And it is a fascinating story how that happened, which he attempts to explain in the book. Itís called Jesus Is Risen, and itís about the birth of Christianity using the Book of Acts. Itís all in the Book of Acts, folks. I mean, when I say, ìItís all there,î it is. I mean, itís not a substitute for reading the Bible, but the Book of Acts, itís all there.So he uses the Book of Acts, and six New Testament epistles as the introductory guide here to get people who want to read the Bible but are intimidated by it to actually get started doing it. So itís sort of a primer that when you finish this book and start the Bible, youíll have a head start, and youíll be more likely to stay with it. It details the suffering and the sorrow, the joys and the triumphs of the apostles and all of the key figures in Christianity following the death and resurrection and ascension of Jesus Christ.Which, if the resurrection doesnít happen, then Christianity doesnít exist. And thatís one of the toughest things to make people believe. How in the world thatÖ? You canít physically put your arms around that, resurrection from the dead. But itís a key element of Christianity. Itís one of the big stumbling blocks that people have. I canít even imagine that. I mean, I heard (I donít want to mention any names) a liberal talk show host really berating a Christian. ìDo you really believe that? That canít be! Thatís why you people are nuts.ìYou canít really think that somebody died and came back to life. Thatís why people think youíre crazy!î Well, for Christianity to be what it is, that had to happen. And my brother, David, is devoted to helping people believe that it happened by accepting whatís in the Bible. But before you can accept whatís in the Bible, you have to open it. Look, itís not simply a primer; itís its own story. It has its own telling of the tale. But itís designed to be sort of like an introduction to the Bible and to Christianity, both testaments.But this focuses on the Book of Acts because thatís where it all is. Now, donít just read the Book of Acts and forget everything else, but itís all there in the Book of Acts. Thatís why David chose the Book of Acts to start. Again, I thank you for giving me the time to mention this. It would not be timely at any time in the next two or three days because of all the other news happening out there. But, again, itís Jesus Is Risen. It just hit on Tuesday.I think itís been hovering around 13 to 19 on Amazon, and heís busy doing all of his interviews about the book now. Heís had a bunch of them scheduled on Fox and heís been broomed because they canít leave the Kavanaugh story. So I thought I would do what I could here to help make people aware that the book is out. Jesus Is Risen by David Limbaugh ó and, believe me, I think it will serve its purpose if you have any interest at all in getting into this. Itíll give you introductory how to do it, where to go, and not be intimidated by any of it.  "

Youíre next. Iím glad you waited.CALLER: Thank you, Rush.RUSH: You bet.CALLER: We love you here in Kansas City. Wish you would come back.RUSH: Well, you know, I have a lot of friends in Kansas City, and I have been back periodically, but I do it on the down low.CALLER: Right. Right. Well, the reason Iím calling is I think sometimes Iím the only woman in the whole country that thinks that Dr. Fordís testimony was not credible, that her whole demeanor and her body language, it was just so rehearsed and coached. From the way she acted behind the microphone like she had never seen one before in her lifeÖ Her voice was quivering and I donít mean to sound cruel, but, I mean, that wasÖ I canít believe that, you know, an intelligent and well-educated world traveler, public speaker, can get behind a microphone and act like itís like she was just the most frail and wilted flower in the world, you know.RUSH: You know, we hadÖ I didnít get to this yes. I had an audio sound bite. A Hollywood actress or an actress somewhere that Iíve never heard of did a video impersonation of Dr. Ford, and it was so spot on, and it was exactlyÖ I noticed her speech pattern. Those of us whose profession involve the voice know very well the various vocal techniques that professional vocalizers use, and she used to a great effect what is called uptalking or up-speaking, and that means to end every sentence on an up note.It promotes the idea that youíre young and innocent and vulnerable, and itís what you say was the little girl type voice. This Hollywood actress did a perfect impersonation and is being destroyed. She put it on Twitter. Sheís being destroyed. She had to apologize for it and tell everybody she supports Dr. Ford, she just was amazed and she wanted to do her impersonation to show her talent, but it got taken down, and I didnít get a chance to get to the video. Maybe we can drum it up from yesterdayís archive and play it for you.But itís a perfect illustration of how she speaks. I have to tell you something. Yvonne, youíre not the only woman who doesnít believe her. The female prosecutor the Republicans hired, Rachel Mitchell, has put together a devastating forensic analysis of Dr. Fordís testimony, and it isÖ Iíve got that here, but it prints out to eight pages. Thereís no way I canÖ I mean, I guess I could share various excerpts of it with you. But, I mean, it is just devastating on the substance. Forget the way she spoke and how she appeared and so forth. And the Democrats are acknowledging it as (impression) ìWell, sheís partisan. We canít we canít take seriously a thing that that woman says.î And theyíre so rejecting it. But, no, youíre not the only one, Yvonne, who has your opinion.CALLER: And, you know, I just didnít buy it for a minute. I really did (unintelligible) little, you knowÖ Thatís what she wanted us to believe she was. And also in her testimony, we watched it all day long. We just couldnít get away from it. But her testimony, when she was talking about going into the Safeway store with the mother, she went into the store at another door, and then she confronted or she saw this Judge óRUSH: Yeah.CALLER: ó character that said atÖ Okay, she said she went up to him and said hi and was friendly and how he just acted like he didnít want to have anything to do with her.RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: Why would you do that? If he had just done what he supposedly had done just a few weeks earlier and it traumatized you, why would you go up to him and try to be a friend, then? You know, nobody has touched on that, and I thought, thatís crazy!RUSH: I did itÖJust to show youíre not alone on this, Yvonne, I had a caller yesterday or maybe Friday, that made the exact point that if you really have been traumatized by a guy and you see him in the Safeway, you donít, you donít run up and say hi. In fact óCALLER: Go the opposite óRUSH: Not even that. I know people who wonít even talk to people theyíve broken up with! See somebody nearby that they broke up with a year ago, six monthsÖ I donít want to go. I donít want to see that person. By the way, the useÖ Her saying ìSafewayî is very, very important, folks, where she saw Judge, ícause Judge has written a book. Itís part of his recovery therapy for drug addiction and alcoholism and depression, and he was told by the therapist to write a book, not a memoir, but to write a book about his problems, and he placed himself in Safeway stores as an employee.So she just happens to say she runs into him in a Safeway. And itís thought that that was strategy after having read his book that it would give Ford credibility to cite the fact that she saw him in a Safeway store since he had written about it. It was designed to give herself proof or some measure of proof. But, Yvonne, youíre not alone, and youíre right on the money to out of this. We were able to get the audio of the actress impersonating Dr. Ford.Youíll notice here the uptick. Iím not gonna mention the actressís name because sheís taken this down and sheís getting a lot of heat and I had never heard of her anyway. Iím not trying to insult her here, I just had not hurried of her. But I donít want to mention her name and cause her any more grief, but she did her imitation of Christine Blasey Ford and this is it.ACTRESS: I donít know if anybody is listening to the Dr. Blasey Ford testimony about Brett Kavanaugh, but this is how I sound. I know itís a surprise to even me that I talk this way and Iím a doctor and a grown woman. I sound like Iím still back at that high school party. Um, I canít help it. I just have this kind of a voice, like a baby, even though Iím a doctor, and Iím on this media circus political stage, and I have kids myself that I donít know why I speak with vocal fry (sic), but you can listen to my testimony and hear that a grown woman sounds this way, Dr. Blasey Ford, thank you.RUSH: Well, thatísÖ I mean, thatís so spot on, youíd think itís her! And that woman, Twitter destroyed her; so sheís pulled that down. But you notice, you hear the uptick there. It is said that this is how valley girls, California valley girls speak. Itís not just them. Itís young girls, teenage girls sound this. And very vulnerable. Thatís key to this. The key to Blasey Fordís speech pattern was sounding vulnerable and scared and just totally innocent and, (impression of Christine Blasey Ford), ìWhy am I here? I, I, I think sooooo. I, I, Iím not suuuuure,î and it just works. It makes you think that whoever youíre hearing is scared to death, is very vulnerable; couldnít possibly be lying.But how many 53- or 55-year-olds do you hear speaking that way?  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/25/declassified-documents-will-be-giant-step-toward-draining-the-swamp/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 25, 2018RUSH: Back to the phones in the Green Bay area with Attila. (chuckles) Attila, welcome to the EIB Network. Hello.CALLER: Thank you. Iím a lifer! In 1989, I was in high school and I started listening to you while mowing my yard.RUSH: Well, I appreciate that. Itís always great to hear from lifers. Thank you very much.CALLER: Yes. We need lions in this day and age, not lambs ó and you, sir, are a lion who inspires a lot of folks in the younger generation like Ben Ferguson and John Muir of our Green Bay radio station, young conservatives. Anyways, to my point, sir, I feel kicked in the gut, and I want your reaction. Reason guided by experience and wisdom. What is your take, Rush, on the retraction of the declassification order by the president for the text messages between Peter Strzok, Donkey Teeth Lisa Page, and Bruce Ohr and Andrew McCabe and the FISA?RUSH: Yeah.CALLER: I was so excited, and then the retraction came. The wind is out of my sails, and I wanted your reaction.RUSH: Youíre not alone in that. A lot of people are, and especially people like Devin Nunes and Mark Meadows. Members of Congress had a lot of invested in this stuff being declassified and made public. Declassification is one thing. Making it public is another. Hereís what happened. Supposedly, some of our allies appealed to President Trump to not make this stuff public because it would be so embarrassing to them. Translation: The Brits.Translation: Cambridge and Oxford professors who do double time at MI6 and MI5, plus people (the spies and so forth) that work there. Because there is no doubt in my mind, given Stefan Halper and Joseph Mifsud and some of the others at the FBI hired as embedded spies in the Trump campaign ó thereís no doubt in my mind ó that they are up to their necks in this stuff themselves! And whatís in these documents proves the coup!It establishes what was going on! The deep state is witnessing this unravel in front of their faces. Thatís why all of this is happening with Rosenstein, and there obviously was an appeal made to Trump by our allies to not make this public for fear of damaging the allied relationship. At some point, that has to go by the wayside. I was disappointed like you and a lot of people were because weíve been led to believe that these documents will put an end to all this and bring to light everything we have thought weíve known thatís been going on ó that it will prove it, and even more.I am a firm believer that this stuff is gonna be made public at some point. I really do believe it is. I think Trump acquiesced to the wishes here of our allies for the time being, for the sake of other elements of his foreign policy that he wants to achieve ó for example, at the United Nations today, this speech of his. It was strong. It was America first. He told Germany not to be dependent on one source of energy. This is Russia. But he didnít ream íem. He just pointed out the mistake that theyíre making.He really laid out Iran, all of the horrible things that Iran has done. He made a joke about Rouhani. He said, ìEverything I hear about him is heís very, very nice guy. But no, I donít expect to be chatting with him this month or this week.î You know, Brexit is still a mess, and Trump has a desired outcome with that. So I think this is Trump balancing the alternatives and realizing he can make it public at any time. The Brits made a request; heís gonna honor the request for whatever foreign policy considerations he thinks are important.But I think heís gonna publicize it at some point. Remember, weíve still got, well, 40 days before the midterms. Take 10 off ícause you need enough time out there and permeate. Say we got 30 days. I do believeÖ I donít know anything, but I do believe that itís going to happen. In fact, I think thereís so much going onÖ I mentioned earlier that the Mueller investigation, and I just have a sense. I got these instincts, these gut feelings that pop up now and then.And I really believe that the wind is gone from the Mueller investigation, because there isnít anything there! They knew even before Mueller started that there wasnít any collusion, so they were looking for ways maybe make people think was. They couldnít even find that! They couldnít even find fake evidence. They couldnít even manufacture credible fake evidence, after all of the newspaper stories, after all of the attempts that have been made.I donít think Mueller is winding down for any reason other than he knows thereís no ìthereî there. But I think these documents have to come out, because that would end this, and it would end this quickly. This needs to be ended like the Kavanaugh confirmation vote needs to happen quickly. There has been so much government misconduct and corruption that it needs to come to light and people need to know just how extensive it was.People need to know exactly what happened from the files made by the conspirators and the people involved in this coup themselves. People need to know that there was indeed ó from the upper echelon of the Obama Department of Justice and the Obama intelligence apparatus ó a purposeful, coordinated effort to undermine a campaign first, a transition second, and a presidency third. This needs to come out. It needs to be made public.The American people need to see the evidence. Not written by newspapers, not manufactured by anonymous sources, but actual documents created by the participants who had to (because of numerous regulations and laws) document what they were doing. Thereís also something else. You know Sidney Powell, the author of a great book, License to Lie, which I have cited and quoted here on numerous previous occasions. She makes the pointÖRemember the Weiner laptop that Comey used to reopen the Hillary email investigation on October 28, 2016? The Democrats erupted over this. It was because some of Hillaryís State Department emails were found on Huma Abedinís husbandís computer, ìCarlos Danger.î That would be Anthony Weiner! This is the guy that was texting ó another Democrat, by the way, who was texting ó nude photos of his penis to young girls. Why men do that, Iíll never know, but I guess he thought he was particularly beautiful in that way.Heís sending them out there to teenage girls and Huma is embarrassed and humiliated but Huma stays with him for the duration following the great example of Hillary Clinton. She did so, but on that computer remember they told us in that week that there were tens of thousands of emails, and in two days they told us they reviewed them all? ìNothing to see here! We are officially closing the case.î They didnít read those emails on that computer.And point has been made that we need to see that laptop, we need to see what was on that laptop because on that laptop perhaps the names of every person in the House or Senate for whom misconduct claims were paid from a congressional slush fund. Have you heard about this fund, folks? The members of Congress created a fund. They control the purse strings of the government, the budget.They created a fund, a pile of money from which mischaracterize claims against them would be paid. So if you are an abused woman or an confused employee and mistreated and whatever and you charge them, file suit, the money to pay off the accusers came out of this slush fund. Supposedly the Weiner laptop has some of that evidence on it, and itís elsewhere as well as. But especially at this juncture with what theyíre trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh, it would be highly helpful and informative to find out the names of every person in the House or Senate for whom misconduct claims were paid and how much and what the allegations are.We need it before voting starts ó early voting, absence voting. That needs to happen, too, all of this. While everybodyís focusing on what Kavanaugh did or didnít do ó and he didnít do it because nobody has any evidence that he did. We have a slush fund, and we have a money pool from which misconduct claims have been paid. For whom, how much, and for what were they accused? The double standard here seems like itís the only standard that exists in Washington.Youíve got a guy Kavanaugh who hasnít done anything, nothing close to what heís been accused of. Certainly, nobody can prove it. There isnít any evidence for any of these allegations ó and yet evidence for mistreatment of women and abuse abounds elsewhere, but itís hidden and swept under the rug and paid off privately with government money. And a lot of this could be learned easily with the declassification of certain documents. So Iím with you out there, Attila, that it needs to happen.The only thing I can think of is that Trumpís foreign policy concerns, policies desires need cooperation from some of these allies. But I hope this is just a temporary delay. Thatís why at every Trump rally, what is the No. 1 sign they see, outside of Make America Great? Whatís the number one sign you see at a Trump rally, Mr. Snerdley? (interruption) Nope. ìDrain the swamp.î ìDrain the swampî is the No. 1. ìBuild the wall,î No. 2. (ìLock her upî is really a chant.) But ìdrain the swampî is why Trump was sent there, and declassifying these documents would be a giant step for mankind in draining the swamp.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/24/where-does-the-right-to-be-heard-end/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 24, 2018RUSH: You know, one of my big bugaboos, ladies and gentlemen, is this business of ìright to be heard.î People misconstrue the First Amendmentís right to free speech to also mean right to be heard, and weíre hearing it now in the case of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford that she has ìa right to be heard.î This is all part of the left trying to stand our system of jurisprudence upside down and on its head. ìFord should be treated with respect, and she deserves an opportunity to share her story.î Well, she did. She wrote about it in the Washington Post.
The Drive-By Media has been repeating her story ad infinitum for how many weeks now? Even our good friends, some conservative commentators, are hell bent showing the media/left that we can be open-minded. Even as conservatives, we are suggesting that she should be treated with respect and she deserves an opportunity to share her story. Well, let me ask this: Once it becomes pretty obvious that a personís making false claims of attempted rape, at what point do we draw a line and say, ìWe no longer have to grant this opportunity to be heard and share a storyî?Let me call your attention to the accuser in the Duke lacrosse case. Remember how that panned out? Hereís the accuser, and the white Duke lacrosse team guys were automatically guilty. Why? Because they were white and because they played lacrosse. (impression) ìLacrosse is considered a sport for rich Republicans and people that belong to country clubs ó and therefore, theyíre not real people. Theyíre not average, ordinary people. Who plays lacrosse? Lacrosse is a phony, nose in-the-air game. Who cares! Duke lacrosse players!îAnd the accuser was a poor black woman who made her living by dancing with few clothes on next to a pole whenever people hired her to do so. She was assumed to be automatically credible and believable. Why? Because of who she was accusing and because she was a minority. Minorities are always gonna be believed by the left. They wouldnít make it up and the left wants them to be telling the truth. Remember how that played out? Those men on the Duke lacrosse teamís lives were targeted for destruction.You know what I remember about that? Even when it became obvious that the accuser had made it up, it was one of the hardest things in the world to get the charges dismissed anyway because once prosecutorsÖ In this case, his name was Mike Nifong. They got rid of him. But once charges are made, getting them withdrawn seems like something the system isnít equipped for. You can attest to this, Dawn. Youíve been in court. When there are charges, they have to be dealt with. ìWe donít withdraw the charges!ìEven if thereís evidence to prove that theyíre wrong, we have to see it through.î It took weeks to get those charges withdrawn, even after it was learned that she had made up the whole story. Thatís what I remember about that: A newfound appreciation for people falsely accused. The charges donít go away, even at the moment itís discovered that theyíre made up. It took, I think, the governor a new prosecutor ó and even when they withdrew the charges, they did it in such a way as to cause as little damage to the department that did it. I mean, they did dump all over Nifong. But, boy, it took a long time.So do we respect the Duke lacrosse accuser? Do we respect the woman who accused an entire fraternity in Charlottesville? Thatís the Rolling Stone story. The writer just made it up with a woman who was claiming she was gang raped by all these people. Do we treat her with respect? At what pointÖ? is my question. At what point do we turn from hearing a person out over and over and over again to then rightfully condemning them for making it up and telling a lie to destroy innocent people? Ask the Duke lacrosse guys if they will everÖOnce itís learnedÖ As they go through life, once itís learned who they are, the first reaction is, ìOh, youíre the guys accused of rape. Youíre the guys that they said raped that that poor dancer.î Even though they know that the guys were exonerated! Thatís how youíre known. This is what they are attempting to do to Brett Kavanaugh, and now this despicable Michael Avenatti is accusing Kavanaugh and Mark Judge of participating in the targeting of women with alcohol and drugs in order to allow a train of men to gang rape them!We donít even know who this accuser is, and Avenatti ó at this moment ó is demanding to be heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee. And heís using the personal pronoun ìweî demand to be heard. We donít know who ìweî is. Hereís the sticking point: If the Republicans just hold together, they can cram all of this right back down the throats of the Democrats in a vote to confirm Kavanaugh. If they hang together. Now, over the weekendÖ Because Iím a powerful, influential member of the media, therefore people attempt to influence me into doing their bidding.I have to be very wary and very careful of all of these come-ons to me, and theyíreÖ Oh, some of them are so flattering, you wouldnít believe! Anyway, scuttlebutt over the weekend was that Jeff Flake, the outgoing senator from Arizona, was gonna vote ìpresentî for Kavanaugh on the committee. We donít know about the whole Senate. And then I think Flake was out saying, ìNo, no, no, no! Thatís not true. Itís not true.î But, you know, Jeff Flake until Trump came along was actuallyÖI mean, some of you will argue with me on this. But for the most part, Jeff Flake was a conservative. I mean, itís questionable to say reliable, but he was a conservative. Heís not that anymore, which is why heís now a hero to the Drive-By Media and the Democrat Party. Kavanaugh also, by the way, has calendars from 1982 that show he was out of town nearly the entire summer, which is when the alleged incident with Blasey Ford is believed to have happened.You know what they will say? ìHe made íem up! He created those calendars in the past two weeks! Heís a lying skunk is what he is!î Thatís what theyíll say, or theyíll refuse to admit them on the grounds of they canít be verified. I think itís time to end the flexibility on this. Grassley has got to call the vote. Be done with this and take it forward or this circus is never gonna end. By design. I will just tell you this again.If Grassley gives the Democrats enough time, they will eventually produce a woman who claims to be Kavanaughís secret Russian wife who Trump paid to urinate on the Obamasí hotel bed in Moscow. Oh, yeah! Kavanaugh is a bigamist too. Nobody knew but heís got a wife in Russia. Sheís gonna come forward. Sheís gonna say sheís Kavanaughís wife. Sheís been Russian for as long as she been born, and she was paid by Trump to hire a bunch of prostitutes and go urinate on the bed Obama slept in. They will pull out all the stops.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, here is my point on the Duke lacrosse case guys. ìOn April 11, 2007, North Carolina Attorney General [and now Governor] Roy Cooper dropped all charges and declared the three lacrosse players innocent of the rape allegations.î The attorney general, Roy ìCooper stated that the players ó Reade Seligmann, Collin Finnerty, and David Evans,î rich white guys, obviously Republicans ícause they play lacrosse. Actually, itís namby-pamby. (sigh) Never mind. They ìwere victims of a ëtragic rush to accuse.'îYou know when event happened? March of 2006. March of 2006 to April 2007. After 13 months, the charges were dropped. There are stories that the case was settled for $60 million, $20 million to each of three Duke lacrosse players. Their lawyers deny that their settlements were anywhere near that large. These three guys ó Seligmann, Finnerty, and Evans ó to this day have not talked about it. You talk about a gross miscarriage of justice? They didnít do it! They never did do it. It was made up from the get-go ó and the left?The faculty at Duke UniversityÖ I forget what percentage. It was a large percentage of the faculty wrote letters admonishing these kids and claimed they should be expelled! Just like the Hollywood actresses in this case: ìWe believe her.î On the basis of what? ìWell, she said so!î Right. So canít question that, and the accuser doesnít have to prove anything. The burden of proof is on the accused. Thereís a reason why thatís not incorporated into our system of justice.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Scott in Staten Island in New York.  Iím glad you waited, sir.  Hi.CALLER:  Oh, thank you, Rush.  Itís an honor speaking to you, sir.RUSH:  Thank you, sir.CALLER:  Rush, you made a great point before how, you know, back in the day that had the left been acting like this, you could take a bunch of votes away from them and the midterm, you know, we take 10, 20 votes, and we would have the seats.  But today is a different day, Rush. You know, with these kids in college now, you know, that are able to vote. And even the people that are like in their thirties and forties, their thinking is a lot different.  And itís justÖ Thatís how their crazy thinking is.  I mean, you would think that we would get a lot more votes, you know, to our conservative side. Because I canít see how anybody would want to vote Democrat with how great the presidentís doing, and the garbage that the left is doing to the president and to Judge Kavanagh.RUSH:  Well, get this.  Let me interrupt you.  Iím sorry, but weíre running out of time, and youíve said something here I want to react to.  One of the reasons is ó and I canít tell you how it bugs me to have to admit this! But one of the reasons is people donít know how good the countryís doing. The press is not filling them each day with news of the recovering economy.  There was a story I saw over the weekend of some Republican, elected Republican.They had taken some polling, internal polling, and they discoveredÖ It was said to me, ìRepublicans have learned that the tax legislation, tax cuts are not helping them at all, that people are blaming the Republicans for tax cuts because they think the only people that got tax cuts are corporations and the rich.î  Now, the tax cuts and the wiping out of regulations is why this economy is burgeoning, because everybody ó and a lot of people ó got significant tax cuts resulting in more disposable income.Which encourages economic activity, which we are seeing.  But because the media (and probably their teachers in school) are out there saying, ìOnly the rich and corporations ever get tax cuts.  You never do!  The Republicans donít care about you!î If thatís all people hear, thatís what theyíre gonna believe.  Now, part and parcel of this is the Republicans just donít know how to do PR ó and they donít even try ícause they think they will not succeed getting their message out because of the media blockading it.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/18/flashback-1991-rush-on-charlie-rose-debating-clarence-thomas-and-anita-hill/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 18, 2018RUSH: Weíve been here. Weíve been here before, folks.We have been here. Yesterday on this program I cited and shared with you how livid I was back in 1991 when this Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill thing was going on. I made mention of this because Iím feeling the identical sense of anger and outrage now. But there are substantial differences. In 1991, CNN was the only cable news network and this show (and some other local conservative radio talk shows which had begun to spring up) was it.There was no blogosphere. There was no Fox News. There was nothing. This show and other related local radio talk shows were it in terms of conservative opposition, and when I was talking about how angry I felt yesterday, it triggered something in Cookieís mind. Cookie controls the archive of audio sound bites of this program, not just sound bites weíve used, but actual sound bites of me. And it triggered something. She went back to our archives and she found in 1991 in October an appearance I made on Charlie Rose.It was after this show, by the way. Iíve never been invited back by Charlie Rose and PBS. Not that Iím whining about it. Iím not. Itís just historical fact. I want to play these sound bites for you because what they show is weíve been here before. It is the same exact playbook. It is the identical thing. Back in 1991, I had to go on TV to refute these clowns. I donít have to do that now. But back then I did. I was so livid, I canít tell you. I didnít know Clarence Thomas, but I knew what this was.I knew this was not about sexual harassment with Anita Hill. This was about denying Clarence Thomas a seat on the United States Supreme Court. One of the most easy, instinctive things I have ever done is defend Clarence Thomas. I had people saying to me at the time, ìRush, youíre really way out there. You donít know the guy.î ìI donít care. I do know the guy. I know plenty of people who know him. Iíve seen him talk. My instincts on this are this is a fine, decent man. I know heís being railroaded. I know this is a typical, left-wing trick.îI had no doubt then; Iíve got no doubt now. Letís go back. I just want to share this with you for the purposes of demonstrating to people that this is just another page from the playbook, that weíve been here before, that thereís nothing even really unique about this in terms of Democrat strategy. So itís October 15, 2001, Charlie Roseís show on PBS.It aired at 11 oíclock at night live on PBS back then. He had me on with the executive director of the New York Urban League, whose name was Harriet Michel. Weíre talking about Thomasí appointment to Supreme Court. Charlie started by saying, ìWhat should the Senate Judiciary Committee have done if somebody comes to their attention and raises the issue of sexual harassment? What should the committee have done?îBEGIN ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH ARCHIVE: The thing that has to be done is the American system of jurisprudence has to be consistent in focusing. I kept hearing people talking about ìthe seriousness of the charges.î The seriousness of the charges is irrelevant. The nature of the evidence is whatís relevant. The presumption is always with the accused and just ícause someone comes forth at the last moment and claims that something happened, her accusation cannot be regarded as evidence. And, if thereís nothing to corroborate it, there is no way ó just because she charges it ó any weight should be given it.ROSE: All right, itís evidence but it doesnít have corroboration, but ó but óRUSH: No, itís not evidence! An accusation is not evidence. It canít be evidence.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: It canít be! An allegation is never evidence, it cannot be evidence ó and, notice, back then they didnít care. It was evidence. It was the seriousness of the charge. They didnít care about it being corroborated, just like today. Her lawyer is saying, ìItís not her job to corroborate the charge. The charge is enough! The allegation is enough. When we say it, thatís what happened.î Thatís their cock-certain, arrogant attitude. ìWhen we say it, it happened, and itís up to investigators to prove that it didnít.îWhy hasnít the woman come forward before now? Why has she not accepted the invitation to come to the committee? F. Chuck Toddís out there saying, ìDo you people who think that a woman of her age would destroy her life by coming forward like Christine Blasey Ford is now, you donít understand left-wingÖî What do you mean, destroy her life? Has Anita Hillís life been destroyed or is she become a hero? Anita Hillís become a heroine! They still make books about her.They take something that didnít happen, they make it look like it did happen, and they make her a hero victim. Theyíre now trying to say that Anita Hill was actually at the forefront of the #MeToo movement. There has yet to be a shred of evidence that Clarence Thomas did what he was alleged to have done, and yet look what theyíve done with it ó and theyíre in the process of doing the same thing to Kavanaugh, and Iím afraid we donít have an Arlen Specter this year.Oh! In fact, if you forgotÖ I got three more of these Charlie Rose sound bites. Hang on. Arlen Specter back in 1991 just took it to Anita Hill. Legally. I donít mean in an unfair way. He just destroyed her as a witness, and I think it had such a profound impact on him. Itís one of the reasons why he became a Democrat much later on in life. I heard somebody say on Fox that that couldnít happen today. It was last night. It was last night. Somebody on Fox was saying, ìYeah, there could not be the kind of interrogation of Anita Hill by Arlen Spector in this #MeToo movement.îSee? So a woman makes an allegation and we cannot probe her as though she is a human being. Arlen Specter ripped Anita Hill apart, demonstrated that a lot of this could not be backed up, had no evidence ó and he got creamed for it; donít misunderstand. But the idea that today we couldnít do that? Like if this woman were to show up and be interrogated or questioned, we couldnít do to her what Arlen Specter did to Anita Hill.Which means because of the #MeToo movement we pretty much have to go with whatever a woman who claimed to have been abused says. We canít investigate too much, we canít probe too much because that then is potentially harming psychologically to the victim and all this.î All of this is part of the plan too. To soften any attempt to get to the truth of these things has been long part of the strategy. Let me go back to the Charlie Rose sound bites. After that bite where I made it plain to Charlie Rose that an allegation is not evidence because it doesnít have corroboration, Charlie said, ìWell, it is evidence. It just doesnít have corroboration.îI said, ìNo. It is not evidence. It cannot be evidence.îBEGIN ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: I think that whatís happened here is that liberals fear the democratic process because people vote against liberal things. Liberals cannot win the White House. When the referendum is conservatism versus liberalism, liberalism loses in landslides. The Supreme Court is the most important political branch of government to liberals. Thatís where all of liberalism has found its way into our society and theyíve lost it now and they feel they have no recourse. Itís sheer panic out there, I think, Charlie, and I donít exaggerate here. I think that they are palpably worried óROSE: Yeah.RUSH: ó that they now no longer have a route to the mainstream of society.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Right, and this kept going. The next sound bite here isÖ Letís see, what is it? I asked Harriet Michel of the New York Urban League if she believed Anita Hill.BEGIN ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Do you believe her?MICHEL: Do I believe her?RUSH: Why do you believe her?MICHEL: Yes, I believe her.RUSH: Why would you believe her? Can I ask you why you believe her?MICHEL: I ó I ó I believe her ó I be óRUSH: She offered no evidence, Harriet. There was no óROSE: You asked the question. Let her answer.MICHEL: Thatís exactly right. I believe that for everybody to make this assumption that Clarence Thomas, the public persona, cannot possibly ó under any circumstances, in a room one on one with a female ó be gross and be obnoxious is out of their minds.RUSH: Wait a minute. Whatís dangerous is assuming he did it with no evidence.MICHEL: I donít ó I donít assume that he did it. I believe óRUSH: If you believe her, you have to.MICHEL: I believe that itís possible that he did it, and I believe that four óRUSH: So we convict him on that?MICHEL: ó lawyers coming forward óRUSH: We convict him on the possibility?MICHEL: This wasnít a trial though!RUSH: Oh, it was.MICHEL: And the fact that the possibilityÖ I happen to believe there is a cloud that follows him.RUSH: Because what?MICHEL: I happen to believe it.RUSH: Because what?MICHEL: Because I donít thinkÖRUSH: She wants there to be a cloud.MICHEL: I think that she was a credible óRUSH: I think you want there to be a cloud.MICHEL: No, I think óRUSH: Thatís what this is all about.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: No evidence. No reason to believe her. She just chooses to believe her. Itís where we are ó exactly where we are here ó with the same kind of thinking, the same kind of thing. Well, thereís no reasoning going on here. This is pure politics. None of these people know this woman, I donít think. (chuckling) You know, before this is all over, we might find out that this womanís family had something to do with Perkins Coie, which had something to do with the Steele dossier. I mean, anything is possible with this group of people!Would you be surprised if this woman was found to have roots by virtue of people sheís known to the Steele dossier and to the effort to get Trump kicked out? Would you be surprised if, after all this shakes out, we found out this woman is actually a resistance activist? Iím not saying so. Although if I wanted to be like a liberal, I could I could make an allegation right here. ìI donít have any evidence but I could start making the claim this woman is a left-wing activist.ìSheís got ties to the Steele dossier! Sheís part of the effort to get rid of Donald Trump and has been from day one.î ìYou canít say that!î ìWhy?î ìBecause you donít know it to be true.î ìWell, you donít know that what sheís saying is true, either, but youíre choosing to believe her.î Itís a one-way street with this stuff. So hereís Harriet Michel who doesnít know Clarence Thomas and look at what she said. Thereís a lot of talk-back there.But she said, ìI believe that for everybody to make this assumption that Clarence Thomas, the public persona, cannot possibly ó under any circumstances, in a room one-on-one with a female ó be gross and be obnoxious is out of their minds.î Meaning youíd be crazy to assume the guy has any morals. You would be crazy to assume that Clarence Thomas behaves himself. In her world, itís totally reasonable to think that Clarence Thomas would force himself on women, one-on-one in a room! Thatís what sheís running around claiming she believes.Is it any different today?Here is the final sound bite, and this is basically Charlie Rose and Harriet Michel. Just listen to this. It will be self-explanatory.BEGIN ARCHIVE CLIPMICHEL: Donít you think that some men were struck by the fact that if this womanís charge had prevented, uh, Clarence Thomas from going on the Supreme Court, that that would then, a lot of men interpret that as perhaps encouraging some other women to come forward and make similar charges? Donít you think if they could get him there and settle this, that means that theyíre not as vulnerable? They didnít feel as vulnerable themselves about similar charges?ROSE: Let me disagree with that. I think, Harriet, that this at least ó among other things ó has raised a consciousness on sexual harassment and therefore itís not so much getting men getting behind them. But it raised the consciousness, and I suspect that thereís a different kind of conversation taking place in the workplace in America as a result of this.END ARCHIVE CLIPRUSH: Ah, right, of course was. And thatís Charlie Rose out there saying that this will change the way men view sexual harassment. It didnít change the way Charlie viewed it. I think CBS had to get rid of him, right? CBS is trying to erase any awareness that Charlie Rose ever worked there! Theyíre getting rid of all the pictures of him in the lobby and all of that. Yet here he was carrying the water for the left back in the Clarence Thomas days. So you see, my friends, weíve been here and done that. There isnít anything new except the players are different and the race is different. Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill were both African-American. Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford both white privilege.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Those sound bites of me on Charlie Rose are 27 years ago, folks. Thatís 27 years. And youíll notice that what I believed and stated back then is identical to today, rock solid because my core is my core. My core beliefs are not calculated daily or weekly or monthly or annually. They are what they are. Youíll also notice that nothing changes with the left. Itís the same things that motivate íem and animate íem and itís the same strategies and tactics that they use. "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/17/lisa-page-no-evidence-of-collusion-at-time-mueller-appointed/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 17, 2018RUSH: We are not gonna be sidetracked by this thing with ó ignoring other news out there. Thereís really, really big news. Another bit of news about Lisa Page, who was the paramour of Peter Strzok Smirk. She ìtestified investigators had no proof of collusion when Robert Mueller was appointed ó Former FBI lawyer Lisa Page admitted earlier this summer that more than nine months into the federal Russia probe, investigators had found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.ìëI think this represents that even as far as May 2017, we still couldnít answer the question,í Page told lawmakers during a closed-door depositionÖî This is just icing on the cake. There was no reason to appoint Mueller. Mueller has not found any evidence of collusion. Lisa Page says that even when Mueller was appointed they hadnít found any evidence of it, and there isnít any evidence now, after two years!BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, in addition to Lisa Page telling congressional investigators this past summer that they had no proof of collusion when Mueller was appointed, no proof of Trump or Trump campaign collusion with RussiaÖ This is the FBI and her buddy Strzok Smirk and McCabe and Comey and all these other conspirators ó Christopher Steele, Glenn Simpson of Fusion GPS, Clapper, Brennan.None of these people! There was zilch, zero, nada, evidence of collusion when Mueller was appointed! Quick. Do you remember why Mueller was appointed? Because Comey engineered it! Comey took notes of his meetings with Trump. He then leaked those notes to a lawyer friend of his ó I think at Columbia ó with the express instructions to leak them to the media. This was to show Trump attempting to obstruct justice in the Flynn case.This was to trigger an independent counsel. Itís the whole reason they wanted an investigator or special counsel looking at this with no specificity. ìJust look! Just search for a crime, find as much as you can for as long as you want,î but there was no crime specified. So this has never been a criminal investigation. Theyíre trying to turn counterintelligence investigations into criminal investigations. Those two do not lap over or cross over, because counterintelligence investigations generally do not produce evidence that can be used in court.But, anyway, sheís admitted that there was no collusion the day Mueller was appointed!This whole thing has been bogus from the get-go.The public was led to believe that the reason Mueller was appointed was to find collusion between Trump and Russia because we knew it happened; we just couldnít prove it! Well, now we have yet another assertion on this episode. It comes from none other than Bob Woodward Friday on the Hugh Hewitt radio program in the morning. Listen to this. Question: ìDid you, Bob Woodward, hear anything in your research that sounded like espionage or collusion?î Youíre in there in the White House, you got people telling things left and right and youíre making up things that they tell you, Bob. Did you hear anybody talk about collusion?WOODWARD: I did not ó and, uh, of course, I ó I looked for it, looked for it hard and óRUSH: Oh, yeah!WOODWARD: ó uh, so, you know, there we are. Weíre gonna see what Mueller has.HEWITT: But youíve seen no collusion?WOODWARD: I have not.RUSH: ìI looked for it. I looked for it hard.î Bob Woodward. Folks, if Bob Woodward didnít find any collusion, I think itís safe to say there wasnít any, because Bob Woodward could have made it up like he made up the quotes from William Casey, who supposedly came out of a coma for 10 minutes to talk to him about Iran-Contra. No collusion. He looked hard! So we have Lisa Page (paramour of Peter Strzok Smirk) saying that when Mueller was appointed, they didnít have any evidence at the FBI or anywhere else of collusion between the Trump campaign or Trump and Russia, and now Bob Woodward.I mean, he looked hard! However many years he spent on writing this, he looked really hard. And he didnít find any collusion. So weíll have to wait and see what Mueller has. Mueller doesnít have anything, because there wasnít any, and yet look at that. Look what that is. Look at what that became. No evidence of the primary reason people think Mueller was appointed. Itís gone on and on and on, and what is its purpose now?To destroy as many people as Mueller can using the criminal justice system for things that didnít happen in their lives related to the Trump campaign or the Trump presidency. Now, over here weíve got the same group of people, same type ó a bunch of Washington, D.C., establishment types now trying to destroy Kavanaugh. Not just defeat, not just keep Kavanaugh off the court. They want to destroy him and his family.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH:  By the way, just to repeat this because itís gotten lost in the shuffle today: Lisa Page, it has been learned, told congressional investigators that ó the FBI, the CIA, the DOJ ó nobody had found any evidence of collusion between Trump and Russia on the day Mueller was appointed.  There wasnít any.  They had found nothing, and that means there was no reason for Mueller to be appointed because the regulations require that a crime be listed for Mueller to pursue.  There wasnít one, and they havenít found any.  Bob Woodward (the other part of the story) was being interviewed and he said heíd been looking for it. Writing this book, he looked for it. He looked really hard, folks! Bob Woodward looked really, really hard for Trump-Russia collusion and in two years of looking he didnít find any.  Bob Woodward, who the left takes as gospel, said there isnít any.  There wasnít any, from both Lisa Page of the FBI and Bob Woodward.  Itís being overshadowed with the Kavanaugh news today, and I wanted to make sure I passed that on twice.    "

We posted it, exclusive video sent to Breitbart. Weíve linked to it at RushLimbaugh.com.If you have time, you really should watch it. And especially if itís surprising to you to learn that Google is the Democrat Party. If that kind of surprises you, you really need to watch this. But it doesnít mean that Google is hogging all the news. Twitter is in the news today. Twitter has announced that they are blocking posts that use the phrase ìillegal alienî as hateful.So if you are going to be tweeting today or tonight, do not use the phrase ìillegal alien.î Whatever they do to you, youíll be shadow banned, deleted, or whatever, because now at Twitter they are saying that is a hateful comment.The federal government, U.S. Supreme Court, lawyers across the country use the word ìillegal alienî to describe immigrants who are here illegally, but it is illegal to use that term on Twitter now. In fact, the Trump administration is reinstituting the phrase in their rules and regulations after the Obama Regime had tried to erase it from all federal records.Twitter is now blocking posts from promoting any messages with the phrase, which its moderators apparently consider hate speech. Quote, ìTwitter is not allowing us to promote any tweets, including the phrase ëlegal aliens,í citing it as hateful content, says the Center for Immigration Studies.î Twitter rejected a total of four ads from the center but provided only vague reasoning for the decision.So illegal aliens are now a protected group. Social media has become its own sanctuary city. Twitter and Google and Facebook are essentially sanctuary cities. So hereís whatís gonna have to happen. Those of you who want to tweet each other about illegal aliens are gonna have to come up with a code phrase. Youíre gonna have to come up with something other than ìillegal alienî to signify youíre talking about illegal aliens or illegal immigrants. And then the trick here is to fool Twitter. So youíre gonna need a code that all of you understand that Twitter will never find out about.ìRush, arenít you worried they could hear you talking?î Nah. Are you kidding? Twitter doesnít know that people like this program exist. And to the extent that they do, they discount it as unreal and tiny and small. You might want to consider just using the phrase ìlegal immigrantî to signify ìillegal immigrant.î I mean those of you who tweet or youíre tweeting amongst yourselves or maybe put your heads together, come up with a substitute phrase that will not ó look it, there are two guys on Fox standing out in the rain right now talking about how it could get really wet.Florence could pack strong winds and catastrophic floodwaters and these two guys are out there standing right on the beach in the midst of the rain and the wind to tell us about it. Note the valor, the bravery.Does the media give itself medals? Anyway, I just saw the 2 oíclock. The track of this thing has changed again. Now itís ó well, itís just unlike ó four days ago, itís nothing like what you thought it was gonna be. Itís still Category 2, claim now to hit land as a Category 2, and it looks like itís gonna hit the just north or actually east of the South Carolina-North Carolina border.The Fox reporters and experts are at Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, right now. The winds are 105 and gusting to 125. If thatís true, those guys wouldnít be able to stand up like they are. So the heavy winds must not have hit where those guys are.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Hey, Iíve got an idea here for you people that tweet. You know, since the Twitter Nazis have decided to ban anything that reads ìillegal alienî as hate speech. Theyíre banning those two words, ìillegal alien.î Iím not kidding. If you missed this, Twitter has decided thatís hate speech, and theyíre not gonna let anybody use it. If you use it, they ban you, shadow ban you, or whatever they do to. So hereís a suggestion. Just turn it around and make it one word, alienillegal, and let that be like a code phrase that you use with each other.Because you want to talk about this, right? But Twitter wonít let you, right? Theyíre gonna ban you or whatever, even though (chuckles) thereís nothing morally or politically or anything incorrect about it. But Twitter doesnít like it. They think it is hate speech. So just turn it around. Alienillegal. Use one L in ìilegal.î You want a code phrase thatís close enough that people will get it without needing some translation card standing by. See if that works. My guess is theyíll pick up on that at some point. But weíll come up with something else that you can use.So Clarence Thomas was the victim of a high-tech lynching. Thatís what he called it. Brett Kavanaugh here apparently is the victim of a low-sewer smearing. Whatever the Democrats have to do in order to stop his confirmation, it appears theyíre going to do it. I donít understand though. Theyíve upon the House. Theyíve already one the House. CNN said today that the Democrats have won the House ó the election is over ó based on a poll theyíve done.Itís over. So why do they have to do any of this?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Hereís Darren in Frankenstein, Missouri. Great to have you on the program today.

We got people not paying attention today. My fault, not yours.CALLER: Itís okay.RUSH: I really wasnít trying to insult Sikeston. I mean, it literally says Frankenstein, Missouri, up there.CALLER: No. Itís okay. It might be the connection; I donít know. Can you hear me okay?RUSH: Yeah. I hear you fine.CALLER: Awesome. Okay. So hereís my thing. Itís amazing what our world is coming to and one thing Iíve found to combat stupidity on the pro Twitter thing is humor and I have kind of just a great sense of humor. So I love your idea, itís kind of like a hashtag, though, like the reversal thing, but Iím thinking something a little fruitier like just using a word like ìpineapplesî or something, something that óRUSH: Now, wait just a second. Wait just a second here. I of course thought of something like that, but wait ítil they find out, because theyíre gonna find out, weíre gonna have to keep changing the code. When they find out that youíre calling illegal aliens pineapples, the next thing theyíre gonna think is youíre making fun of people that have acne and then theyíre gonna start banning people that make fun of people that have acne or zits or whatever.You know, Manuel Noriega, his nickname was ìGrapefruit Face.î Some people called him ìPineapple Face.î I mean, I get the idea here, but you gotta come up with a name that these goofballs at Twitter are not going to think is insulting to illegal aliens. I guarantee you, you might think ìpineapplesî is innocent, butÖCALLER: Pineapple juice, I canít think of anything negative to say about pineapple juice. Itís great for you.RUSH: No, no. Itís what pineapples look like. Remember, these are identity-based people. You start saying illegal immigrants look like pineapples, ícause thatís why you would have chosen the word, youíre calling ó no, no, no. Thatís why alien illegal, with one L in there it ó work amongst yourselves, folks, maybe youíll come up ó but do not pick a name, unless you want to really blow it up, do not pick a name that they will then come back and say thatís what you secretly think they look like or insulting them or whatever. Itís gonna be very tight because thatís what Twitter is gonna think.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. Got it. Hereís the term. We invented this. ìUndocumented Democrat.î Donít say ìillegal.î ìUndocumented Democratî is the new term, ícause itís accurate. It has the added benefit of being true. Itís a new term for ìillegal alienî on Twitter. Use that.  "

Fox News has stopped carrying íem now front to back. Have you noticed that? You have to find a Trump rally either on I think One America network, or you can get íem on C-SPAN. But Fox no longer goes wall-to-wall. I donít think thereís anything to be said about it. I just think that these guys go on for an hour and a half, and they donít stop to run commercials doing them, and they are now campaign rallies. Since weíre in the heat of the campaign season.So I think Fox is dialing back, you know, on the potential equal time claims, even though there arenít any Democrats doing rallies like this. So my point is that not as many people are seeing them. And last night thisÖ Itís such a contrast. I have to tell you, folks. And IÖ This is the kind of thing that you justÖ If you have any observational powers at all, you canít miss this. These people at Trump rallies, theyíre not violent, they are not threatening, theyíre not intimidating, and theyíre not dangerous.And they donít make anybody feel in danger or threatened. These are people having a great time. These are people that are upbeat and happy, they are excited to be where they are. They are part of something that matters greatly to them. They want to be involved and they are. The contrast to the makeup of people and their behavior, the Trump rally and your average, ordinary Democrat protest is striking!You contrast the people at this rally last night, it was at Council Bluffs, Iowa. You contrast that with that unforgivable picture, to me, of these kids clawing at the front door of the Supreme Court Saturday afternoon. (Impression), ìLet us in! Let us in! Let us in!î Banging on the door and clawing at the door trying to get in. I didnít know if I was watching the Wicked Witch of the Westís army or what, but it was certainly nothing that was inspiring or promoted, or you wanted to be part of.The Trump rallies are the exact opposite. And I donít mean the people at Trump rallies are a bunch of nerds and dryballs. Donít misunderstand. Theyíre just wholesome people, and theyíre having a good time, and thereís nothing threatening or intimidating. And thereís a lot of laughter and just general happiness. And you never see that at any Democrat sponsored event.And even if you do have some happy people in the Democrat sponsored event audience, it isnít gonna last long because the Democrat on stage is gonna get mad and outraged and get everybody else ticked off. And I want you to hear a little bit of the Trump rally last night. Itís about a minuteís worth.

And so now there are left-wing stories defining the word ìmobî both on dictionaries and in Wikipedia and trying to make case that itís Republican crowds that are the mob and not Democrats.Theyíre reallyÖ A bunch of Democrats, elected Democrats are just indignant and offended that Trump is daring to call their supporters a mob. Theyíre just, theyíre so unused to having it thrown right back at íem with the same force they dish it out. They are so unused to having their ideas and behavior being criticized, and they really canít stand being laughed at. Oh, oh-ho-ho.

I wouldnít blame íem. I think itís ridiculous to stay out there and stand in the streets when a Category 4 is coming. The winds are now 150 miles an hour, and everybody is genuinely scared to death of this one. This one, it seems is different in terms of how everybodyís talking about it. All eyes currently fixed on Hurricane Michael.It is going to devastate the Florida Panhandle, Category 4. That puts winds anywhere from 130 to 156 miles per hour. Storm surge (which is the primary killer in hurricanes, by the way) is nine to 14 feet at theÖ Thatís notÖ Donít think of a storm surge as a tsunami. Theyíre two different things. Tsunami, sometimes you canít even feel it. A tsunamiís not a gigantic wave. A storm surge is, and people get the two confused. Itís a big eyewall.It is well established. Itís not weakening. Itís continuing to strengthen. Itís gonna have a swath all the way up through Georgia. The way I look at it, itís gonna hit Atlanta, then Augusta, and on into South Carolina, and right through the middle of North Carolina, and itís gonna be dumping rain like crazy. The only thing different here is that this thing is not gonna stop and hover for a couple of days in the same spot.Itís moving at a pretty rapid clip, which is the only thing you can say about it. Now, there was a bunch of previously damaging hurricanes. Thereís all kinds of misinformation out there, and itís because of the corruption of news. People are trying to report today, ìWeíve never had a Category 4 hit the Florida Panhandle.î It isnít true. There have been all kinds of major hurricanes that have hit the Florida Panhandle.Experts have studied sea sediment and lake and river sediment and have found that hurricanes probably hit this region a thousand years ago, when nothing was there and nobody was there. Certainly nothing there to damage. There was a hurricane that hit in a similar location back in 1906, and it wiped out everything from Mobile to Panama City, but there wasnít much to wipe out. There wasnít much infrastructure then.So itís crazy to start comparing financial damage with hurricanes of many, many years ago to today because this region was not nearly as developed with infrastructure and homes and businesses as it is today. The degree of damage that this storm is going to cause is immeasurable. But people are beginning to look at it as a rebuilding opportunity and a chance to, you know, build it all over again. But you cannot miss the devastation thatís coming with this.The governor, Rick Scott, says heís scared to death about this. Thereís no stopping it. Thereís nowhere for people to go, and the evacuation plans have been underway for a while. Some people in condominiums and apartments are not leaving! Theyíre gonna stay there. There are those people that want to stay and live through one of these, primarily to see if itís really like everybody says itís gonna be. Thereís a curiosity among some people.You watch the news, you watch TV, and they tell you how devastating itís gonna be, how destructive itís gonna be, how much rain thereís gonna be, how ìyou canít survive itî itís gonna be. And they say, ìI want to stay and see this!î And then there are others who say, ìI want to stay and Iím gonna protect my home. Iím gonna hang in here with my homestead. Iím gonna stay here with my pets. I am not leaving; you canít kick me out.îSo there will be some people who will hang on and stay. Now, this area is properly known even among the locals as the Redneck Riviera. In modern political parlance, it means a bunch of poor, white-privilege people live there. The Drive-Bys are surprisingly interested in this. I say, ìsurprisingly,î because thereís not a central major population center that can be totally wiped out, that they could equate with, ìSee? See how dangerous global warming is?îBut there is a midterm election coming up, and there is going to be a federal response to this ó and as far as the mediaís concerned, thereís an opportunity. The federal response wonít be any good and so they can call this Trumpís Katrina. Donít get mad at me for talking about this, because Iím telling you right now that is exactly how assignment editors and producers throughout the Drive-By Media are looking at this.Theyíre looking at this as a potential political event that theyíre hoping might be somewhat helpful to them in the midterms elections that are only three weeks away. There is a heated governorís race in Florida. Mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, running against Ron DeSantis. And then Rick Scott, the current governor, is running for the Senate against the incumbent, Bill Nelson. So thereís a lot politically at stake here.You canít deny it, folks. And you canítÖ You cannot ignore the way the media is preparing a bunch of different scenarios to report on this. Itís got the global warming component. Thatís No. 1. As a Category 4, 150 miles an hour, thereís lots of destruction ó human destruction as well. Itís got all the ingredients there. It is the Republican voting stronghold of the state in the views of many. (interruption) No, no.Look, you can get mad at me all you want. Iím just telling you: I know the media. You may think it insensitive of me to be speaking this way. Iím not. Iím telling you how they in the Drive-By Media are planning, and theyíll react at some point. Little Brian Stelter will go out there, ìI canít believe that these kinds of things are being said about us in the imminent danger of the storm!î Iím just telling you, it wonít be long to find out.This hurricane kind of came out of nowhere. It was little tropical storm down of the primary tobacco-growing area of western Cuba known as the Vuelta Bajo. Then it sprang to life as a Category 1, and the National Hurricane Center said, ìYou know, this thing is looking very bad.î Nobody was paying much attention to it, and then all of a sudden itís a Cat 3 and itís making a beeline for Panama City and Panama City Beach ó and here we.The media is now focused on this. Do you think, Mr. SnerdleyÖ? Do you think there is ó and I know itís gonna sound crazy. But do you think the Drive-Bys might be looking for a bit of a respite from all this Kavanaugh stuff andÖ? (interruption) You donít think so? And you donít think the hurricane is providing just a momentary opportunity forÖ? (interruption) Oh, I know they hope it turns into Katrina for Trump. Iíve justÖ And Kavanaugh. They hope it turnsÖ And Rick Scott, of course.They want it to turn into Katrina for every Republican involved here.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: And all eyes remain fixated, once again, on Hurricane Michael. This next 45 minutes to an hour will tell the tale in terms of the actual landfall. Itís gonna be anywhere from Mexico Beach up to Panama City northwest along the coastline. Mexico Beach, I think is what it is, all the way up to Panama City, then Panama City Beach. But this eyewall, according to all ofÖAnd Iíve got some fascinating satellite photography here from the GOES-16 satellite. Itís interesting the way they do this. You know how they take the radar and they attach different colors to it. And what Iím looking at is sheer, solid black surrounding the eyewall, and most of the black is on the south and the west side. And then it gets a little lighter, then some gray, and then dark red, and then bright red, and then yellow, and then tan, and then orange, and then green, and then blue on the edges.Now, these colors do not represent rain intensity. They represent cloud tops. They represent the temperatures at the cloud tops, which determines condensation and can determine intensity of rainfall. But most people watching this have no idea. They think, ìOh, my God! Look at that, Mabel! Look! It must have been a hundred miles per hour. Look at that! Itís black ó black, right around there. Dark red.î Itís designed to scare you. Itís designed to get your attention.Itís cloud-top temperatures. But my point is, itís solid around the eyewall. It looks like the most intense area of this is due west of the eyewall, which is where the population centers are based on where the eyewall looks like itís gonna hit now. But even on the east sideÖ The east and northeast quadrants are where the strongest winds are, and those are gonna be blowing offshore ó toward offshore ó once they hit land on the northeastern side of the eyewall.But itís a solid eyewall, and itís a large eyewall. So itís a very, very intense storm, and the next 45 minutes itís gonna hit land, and then weíll know where and the speed with which it will continue, the amount of rain and storm surge. So itís gonna be a very, very bad bunch of days and intense, bad few hours here for people who live in that region, the Panhandle of Florida.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Pressure is dropping in the hurricane. Thatís not good. Itís now 35 miles south-southwest of Mexico Beach, which is what I think the closest populated landfall area could be. But thatís just my wild guess. One thing about these storms: Theyíre reporting winds at 150 miles an hour, and they just showed neighboring cities and what the wind gusts are. The highest wind gust right now around 64, 65 miles an hour in the Panama City, Panama City Beach area.These 150-mile-an-hour winds are in the eyewall, folks. They are not the entire storm. Iím not trying to minimize the impact here. Itís just the reporting on these storms and the education on these storms in general is, I think, wanting; itís lacking. Such as the way they colorize the graphics of these storms to make it look like hell on earth, when in any hurricane the strongest winds are in the eyewall and a little, you know, extended from it.But thereís not too many places theyíre gonna get 150-mile-an-hour winds today. Where the eyewall hits and maybe 20 miles, depending on the size of the eyewall. Now, from there it will fall off. NothingÖ I mean, 125 is no slouch. If you think that youíve experienced 75-mile-an-hour winds and say, ìWell, thatís not bad. I canÖî The effect of 150 versus 75 miles is not twice when youíre in it. There is a multiplier effect of massive wind speed.So if the fastest and the highest winds youíve been in is 75 miles an hour and you think, ìOkay. A Cat 4 is gonna double this,î it wonít. On the ground, miles per hour it is. But the impact of 150-mile-an-hour winds versus 75? Just destructive capability alone is a factor of three or four. So 150 miles an hour is dead serious. Thatís where the storm surge will be or the worst of it. The further you get from the eye and depending on the structure, the more the wind speed decreases.The rainfall is pretty consistent throughout a much larger area of the storm. But the devastating winds, the worst winds of the storm are only in the eyewall area. People can look at these storms and the graphics, ìWow, 150 miles an hourÖ Oh, winds allÖ? Thatís allÖ? Itís the whole Panhandle.î No, it isnít. Iím not trying to downplay the damage. Iíve just learned all this. We live in Hurricane Alley here, and every time one of these thingsÖI moved here in 1997, and I quickly became a consumer hurricane expert. I became an expert in how to interpret and watch the media. I became an expert in how to analyze the graphics that they use, and I became an expert in where the actual worst damage of a hurricane is. You do not want to get a direct hit. Everybody says, ìYeah, of course, Rush. Everybody knows that.îYeah, but outside the direct hit the damage or the strength of the hurricane diminishes quite a bit. Itís always the direct hit that is the most destructive, and then it starts to decline as you get away from the eye, depending upon the strength of the storm. Is gonna have a wide, destructive swath as a Category 4. Hereís Governor Scott of Florida. This was this morning, a press conference, audio sound bite No. 1. Just to give you a taste of how local officials in the governorís office are dealing with thisÖSCOTT: I just spoke with the president, who, again, offered all available federal resources. We continue being in constant contact with FEMA and their team in the state Emergency Operations Center. That includes experts from Homeland Security, the EPA, the Department of Defense, Health and Human Services, and the Army Corps of Engineers. Along our coast, communities are going to see unimaginable devastating.RUSH: Unimaginable devastating. Thereís a little hype always in this to get people to listen, to get their attention. But thereís always a lot of hype in these things. And, as an expert, a local resident expert, I can tell you that people who live in these areas for a long time have heard this over and over again, and very rarely are these storms as bad as they predict. So people, over the course of time, adopt an attitude and whereas, ìYeah. Theyíre making it worse than itís gonna be for whatever reason, trying to scare everybody and get íem to evacuate or what have you.îPeople deal with these in different ways who live in areas and have experience dealing with them. Now, there have been four major hurricanes in the two years of the Trump presidency. And not a one of them, outside of this mess in Puerto Rico ó not a one of them ó have the media been able to label Trumpís Katrina. Theyíve tried in advance. They have not been able to. It seems the prepís good here too.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: By the way, hereís the calculation on the force of wind versus wind speed. Remember, the force of the wind does not does not double as wind speeds do. The force increases in a much greater rate, and thereís a formula that scientists have developed. The force of wind goes up as a square of speed. So two timesÖ If youíve got 30-mile-an-hour winds that will all of a sudden become 60, the force of that would be much higher, say two timesÖYou would square the 30. Youíd getÖ No, youíd get close to hundred-mile-an-hour force when you get above the 75-mile-an-hour limit is what it really is. So the two times wind is four times the force of the wind. Three times is nine times. You square the speed to find out what the force of the wind is. So 150 miles an hour, itís devastating. Now, where do those winds happen?Are those surface winds? Are those flight-level winds? And this is what you have to have the Hurricane Hunter data to know. But they are reported as winds on the surface, 150-mile-an-hour winds at the surface. I mean, thereís very little thatís gonna survive that. So weíll see exactly what at landfall the true wind force, the wind speed happens to be and find out how close to the forecast it was.Now, look, this is a minor technical point. Iím probably gonna get in trouble for making it. There is a tweet here from the National Weather Service calling this storm the worst-case scenario. But it isnít. Itís a Category 4. Itís notÖ The eyewall doesnít look like itís gonna hit a major population center. Now, do not misunderstand me. I am not saying it isnít a big deal. A worst-case scenario would be Category 5 barreling right over Panama City or Panama City Beach.This thing looks like itís gonna hit between or has hit between Panama City and Mexico Beach. Mexico Beach is such a small place that you have to expand the map to times 10 before it reads out that thereís a city there. This is basically a wooded area, not heavily populated, but Tallahasseeís right down the road from where this thing is gonna hit.Now, this does not mean that Apalachicola and Pensacola and Pensacola Beach and Panama City Beach are not gonna get hit. They are. But not by a worst-case scenario. I had to lookÖ Itís a minor point. Itís no comfort to people in the zone here. Itís just, again, Iím a stickler for the way things end up being reported. People get all ginned up and worked into a frenzy over things, particularly in politics, and usually is not warranted.And itís in this way that media and others so successfully manipulate people, whereas people that try to play it straight and deal with it honestly and straight on are a bit of a disadvantage.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Hurricane Michael now 155-mile-an-hour sustained winds, gusting to 175. This is at the eyewall. This is at the area of landfall, which is not far from Mexico Beach, up the coast of Florida Panhandle, about 15 miles west-northwest. The president today had a briefing with his FEMA people and Homeland Security people and as he is wont to do, he televises the briefings. One of the reasons he does it is so that he can let the media and everybody see what goes on at a cabinet meeting, what goes on at some other special meeting. This was the president being briefed by Homeland Security Chief Kirstjen Nielsen and the FEMA administrator, Brock Long, but Hurricane Michael.THE PRESIDENT: Theyíre reporting that this is one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit our country. Is that actually a fact?LONG: In the are, this would be the most intense hurricane that struck this area since 1851, if I remember correctly, so óNIELSEN: Itís a big storm.LONG: Yeah. Intense. Very intense. But óTHE PRESIDENT: And this one is gonna be heavy rain or is it gonna be the winds that are gonna be the brunt of it?LONG: Storm surge and winds, and for Georgia theyíre gonna see high inland winds; so you may see sustained Category 1, Category 2 winds with higher gusts. Weíre expecting a lot of damage inland as well.RUSH: This is President Trump with the FEMA director and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen being briefed on Hurricane Michael in the Oval Office. Hereís more.THE PRESIDENT: Almost the entire size of the Gulf. When you look at it topically, itís almost the entire size of the Gulf, and they havenít seen thatÖ Maybe they havenít seen that at all. Nobodyís seen that before.LONG: The eye diameter is pretty wide, which, unfortunately, is not good news as it makes landfall. So some people may say itís similar to an EF3 tornado making landfall in the areas that are close to the eye.RUSH: Iím glad this guy said close to the eye. Thatís whereÖ When you read about the high winds and the rain, thatís where the brunt of it is. Now, this storm is so strong that itís bad as you get away from the eye. But the real bad stuff is the eye. This eye, I think I saw 30 milesÖ No, no. Itís not that big. Now that Iím looking, not that big. The smaller it is, the more intense, usually. And, as usual, itís the north and western quadrants here with the wind speeds speeding up and heading in that direction. Hereís one more bite with the president still with the FEMA director and Homeland Security.THE PRESIDENT: We donít know. I was going to Pennsylvania. It looks like there are thousands of people already lined up, and probably weíll do that tonight and weíre gonna go down here as soon as we can. We donít want to interfere with anybody but we want to go as soon as possible. You haveÖ You know, right nearby we have thousands of people going tonight, and theyíve alreadyÖ Many are there already.RUSH: Now, a lot of peopleÖ I get some emails when this stuff happens. ìYou know, youíre falling for it, Rush. It just approves what a suck-up you are. Trumpís not doing this for any other reason than he just wants to brag. Heís just doing this for PR.î No, friends. You may think that, and Iím not gonna try to disabuse you of it. But the presidentís doing this because if he didnít, can you imagine the stories that would be published?ìTrump doesnít care! Trump didnít convene a meeting! Trump didnít ask very many questions! Trump didnít seem curious! Trump doesnít seem to have any real interest since he doesnít have a home there.î All this kind of stuff that they would say about him. He does this for a host of reasons. But most importantly, I believe, Donald Trump likes himself, and heís very proud of the job heís doing, and he wants people to see it. And he knows that the primary conveyors of information in this country do not convey properly information about him.This is only smart.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I was just watching a little bit of Fox News. They got a reporter out there standing in the middle of all this hurricane. His name is Jeff Flock. He was telling Shep, said, ìShep, youíve been out here like Iíve been out here.

RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/25/two-pieces-foundational-to-understanding-the-american-left/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 25, 2018RUSH: First, Jim Geraghty. Folks, this is so right on the money. ìThe more time I spend covering politics,î Mr. Geraghty writes, ìthe more Iím convinced that a significant chunk of grassroots political activists arenít really arguing about politics at all. These folks are actually grappling with personal psychological issues and projecting it onto the world of politics. Every problem they had with a parent is projected onto authority figures.ìEvery religious person who ever scolded them or made them feel guilty becomes the embodiment of organized religion and demonstrates its menace. Because theyíve had a bad experience with a member of a minority group, that experience reveals something sinister about every member of that minority group. The cop who wrote them a ticket instead of giving them a warning demonstrates the danger and corruption of law enforcement,î and can lead to Black Lives Matter.ì[T]he boss who fired them for shoddy work exemplifies the inherent cruelty of the capitalist system, and every frustrating experience they had with an ex-girlfriend demonstrates some defect in all women.î And that could be the opposite. Every frustrating experience they had with an ex-boyfriend demonstrates some defect in all men. (summarized) ìI think a lot of the issues they are grappling with stem from the fact that most of these people have never done anything big with their lives.ìSo everything has to be imbued with drama of an approaching Armageddon in order for them to feel as though their meaningless lives have meaning.î Now, I have said this over and over again a different way. Everybody wants their life to have meaning. Everybody wants to matter. And a lot of people feel overwhelmed, powerless, and like they donít matter ó and one of the faster ways to make yourself feel like you matter is to become a victim, member of an organized victim group.And when you do that, a number of sea changes occur to you. When you become a member of a victim group, you are admitting that you are a failure. But you are admitting it isnít your fault! Itís societyís at large or the cops or capitalism or religion or something. When you become a victim, you are then signaling that you are owed. People need to give you something for all of the mistreatment that you have suffered. I think this is so right on the money, and I could give you some classic examples. Like transgenderism.I know that there are many transgenders in this audience, so I have to be careful here. I just want to tell you that there is a former ó I guess heís retired ó director of the Department of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Medical Center and university who wrote many years ago that sexual identity is a psychological issue and it needs to be treated as such, not with gender-change surgery and this kind of thing.He said that itís a sad thing, itís very unfortunate, but it needs to be dealt with therapeutically and so forth. Of course, he has been ignored or destroyed depending on when his name comes up. But thatís not the only example of this. I think this is so right on the money, and thereís so many elements of this that ring true. The feeling of powerlessness, the comforting thought that itís not your fault, that youíre a victim of some powerful entity or person or system. And then you become a member of the victim group, and you have instant rage and anger that is justified and encouraged.And then you enter the political system under the aegis of your psychological problems being legitimate political issues. These people all naturally will gravitate to the left because thatís where psychological disorders primarily reside. The Democrat Party has made it well known that they will use whatever they can in order to win power. So they have built a coalition of very disparate groups, minorities, including women and union workers over the years, African-Americans, Hispanics, Latinos, you name it. But in each instance, theyíre notÖIn terms of the rank-and-file, theyíre not successful. As Geraghty writes, theyíve really not had something big happen in their lives. Theyíve not had something reinforcing that theyíre worth liking themselves, worth loving themselves. Have you noticed the leftists are constantly angry? Theyíre always agitated. Theyíre never happy! Even when they get what they want, even when they get more than they want, theyíre never happy. What kind of disorderÖ?Like last night Ted Cruz and his wife were hounded of how a restaurant in Washington. Ari Fleischer is writing about it. He says (paraphrased), ìYou know, Iíve been in Washington a long time. This is a sick town. This is a sick town! Simply because you disagree with somebody, you go into a restaurant and you start hounding them to the point that they have to leave?î That isnít normal. But the Democrat Party normalizes it and promotes it. Validates it. Empowers it.So all of these various disorders of one kind or another become empowered and fundamentally important to the electability and future of the Democrat Party. The sad thing is the Democrats donít do one thing to really help these people. Their policies donít help them. Their direct attempts to help them donít help them because Democrat constituents are constantly enraged. They are constantly angry. They are mad, unhappy, blaming everybody ó somebody else ó for whatever they think their plight is. They invest in the Democrat Party to fix it, and ìfix itî means get even with whoever it is thatís responsible for these people feeling the way they feel.Get even with the church, get even with the cops, get even with the Koch brothers, get even with whoever it is that epitomizes capitalism. It becomes understandable when you see these people desiring tax increases on the rich. They donít care whether it helps our hurts them. Doesnít matter, as long as somebody gets punished. The Democrat Party has become the party where most of its constituents want the leadership of the party to punish!So Kavanaugh, as the latest example, is being punished simply because he is normal, simply because he has achieved, simply because heís done something that most leftists and Democrats canít and havenít. That isnít fair. Itís unequal. So heís gotta be taken out just on that basis alone because Kavanaugh represents grand inequality. Kavanaugh represents whatís wrong with America in any way. So regardless whether heís guilty or not, heís gotta be destroyed!Once they set their targets, once they put you in the crosshairs, it doesnít matter what youíve done. Youíve gotta go. Because rage and demanding punishment is the elixir in their minds. Thatís whatís gonna make them feel better. The thing is, it never does. Even when they succeed in having their enemies punished, it never makes them satisfied. And it canít because, as victims, they have built a wall, a block to discovering what actually needs to be fixed in their lives to change them.By becoming a victim, you say, ìIíve done the best I can. I canít do any more because the worldís stacked against me, and Iím gonna have my buddies in the Democrat Party protect me and get even with the people whoíve made my life miserable.î I think Geraghty is exactly right about this. Again he writes, ìThe more time I spend covering politics, the more Iím convinced that a significant chunk of grassroots political activists arenít really arguing about politics at all.ìThese folks are actually grappling with personal psychological issues and projecting it onto the world of politics.î In other words, politics is to blame ó and, of course, when weíre talking about whoís to blame, well, you blame the normal. You blame the happy, you blame the satisfied. Whoís that? Well, in the modern-day, itís become conservatives or itís become Republicans. Thatís the battle that weíre in the middle of, and most people on our side donít have any idea!They donít recognize it. We think, ìWell, this is the left. This is American politics, the Democrat Party,î and it is in the sense that these people are Democrats and vote Democrat precisely because they think they think the Democrats are gonna punish whoever it is that ruined their lives, made them miserable, made them unhappy, and it runs the gamut. You can explain this with every different Democrat constituency. You could illustrate the point with every group. Pick women, and you could make the point.Speaking of which, somebody sent me a note last night and said, ìYou know what, Rush? This #MeToo movement started out as a bipartisan movement. I donít know whatís happened. The left has hijacked it.î What? The #MeToo movement was never bipartisan. Who thinks that? Raise your hand in there. (interruption) Do you think the #MeToo movement was bipartisan? You know why people think that? Because it went after a Democrat first, Harvey Weinstein.ìWell, it must have been bipartisan.î No, it was never. Let me ask you this. Do you know of a conservative group that would ever start something like the #MeToo movement? You donít. Do you know any? It would never happen. The #MeToo movement was a left-wing movement from the get-go. It was the Democrat Party, George Soros bought-and-paid-for structured movement from the get-go. ìWell, Rush if thatís trueÖ If thatís true, then why did they go for a Democrat first, Weinstein?îEasy! After Hillary lost the election, there were powers that be in the media (which runs the Democrat Party, donít forget, in my humble estimation) that wants to wipe the Clintons off of the slate. The Democrat Party, there are some in there that want to get rid of the Clintons as bad as some Republicans do. Theyíve known for decades what Weinstein was doing and who he was! It wasnít a shock! The shock was the New York Times ran the story.Here comes Ronan Farrow, and adding to it, NBC blockades that because theyíve got their own Army of sexual harassers being protected in the news division. But the reason they went after Weinstein is because heís a big Clintonista, heís a Clinton donor, heís a Clinton fundraiser. Thatís what that was about. Thatís why they went after him first, and as it kept going, guess who it kept outing? The #MeToo movement kept outing liberal Democrats in Hollywood.ìWe canít have that!îThe #MeToo movement was taking out its own people. The #MeToo movement was taking out its own captains. So the #MeToo movement had to make a drastic change in direction. It was never bipartisan. Now, people think it was because women across the political spectrum united against a single foe ó sexual harassment and abusers ó and it didnít matter if they were Republicans or Democrats.But it does. Keith Ellison will not even be investigated for a legitimate allegation. The Democrats are ignoring it. Ted Kennedy, Bill Clinton, been through all that. But hereís a Republican didnít do anything heís being accused of doing, and look. Heís now gotta prove he didnít do it. The rule of law is being stood upside down, on its head.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Okay. My second piece that buttresses the explanation of what weíre up against and who it really is comes from is Shelby Steele, who is simply brilliant. Heís a scholar of long-standing at the Hoover Institution, a conservative tank of thinkers out there at the Stanford campus in Palo Alto. His piece called, ìWhy the Left Is Consumed With Hate ó Lacking worthy menaces to fight, it is driven to find a replacement for racism. Failing this, what is left?îThatís the subhead. Now, hereís the conclusion. Iím gonna go backwards forward. Conclusion: ìYet the left is still stalked by obsolescence. There is simply not enough [real] menace to service its demands for power.î Meaning there isnít real mean-spirited racism, sexism, bigotry out there. They have to make it up, have to manufacture it, have to lie about it such as Kavanaugh. Heís not a racist, sexist, bigot, homophobe, any of these things. But look what theyíre saying about him.His point is theyíve run out of real menaces. ìThe voices that speak for the left have never been less convincing,î Shelby Steele says. ìIt is hard for people to see the menace that drives millionaire football players to kneel before the flag. And then there is the failure of virtually every program the left has ever espoused ó welfare, public housing, school busing, affirmative action, diversity programs, and so on. For the American left today, the indulgence in hate is a death rattle.îThey have run out of legitimate enemies and opposition. America is not this dastardly place they make it out to be, and they keep swooping to the bottom of the gutter and lower coming up with news menaces that they have to manufacture ó and ìhateî is the latest one. ìHow did the American left ó conceived to bring more compassion and justice to the worldî in their mindsÖ? And believe me, in their minds, thatís what liberalism is:ìMore compassion, more tolerance, more justice. Itís absurd, but thatís what they think. ìHow did the American left Ö become so given to hate? It began in the 1960s, when America finally accepted that slavery and segregation were profound moral failings. ìThat acceptance,î the admittance, the admission that America had a really rotten element in its past, when America finally accepted that slavery and segregation were profound moral failings.ìThat acceptance changed America forever. It imposed a new moral imperative: America would have to show itself redeemed of these immoralities in order to stand as a legitimate democracy,î and as far as the American left is concerned, that redemption can never happen, by design. America can never redeem itself. America can never recover. ìThe genius of the left in the í60s was simply to perceive the new moral imperative, and then to identify itself with it,î and that has carried forward even to today.  "

Around the wrong women, theyíre guilty for simply being alive.CALLER: Yes. Yes. Itís diabolical, and itís pitting men and women against each other. Where, you know, theyíre looking for women they can respect. They donít hate women, and they donít look at women as just sexual objects. They respect women because their father modeled that with me. So when women, then, respect the men in their lives, it works together just beautifully.RUSH: You know, I wonder about this.CALLER: So at some point, this is going to backfire because every woman hears her biological clock ticking.RUSH: Wait, wait, wait. Everyone woman fears the biology time bomb? What does that have to do with this?CALLER: Every woman hears ó at some point hears ó the biological clock ticking.RUSH: And? And? So?CALLER: You want to find a spouse, a partner to find children with.RUSH: No, not anymore. Not anymore. Itís called go to sperm bank with your female husband. ItísÖ No. Itís called go to the sperm bank, find a way to have a kid or adopt. But no! Young women are being so poisoned about what men are or can be that many of them are forgoing all of that. Theyíre resisting the tug of nature, ícause the tug of natureís gonna pull them toward men, but theyíre trying to resist it ícause of what theyíve been taught. So there are a lot ofÖ Look at the single parent, female head of households that are burgeoning in the country right now.CALLER: That has such a detrimental effect to our country. I know this isnít popular, Rush, but it is just simply true. A child needs, if at all possibleÖ I understand thereís divorce and all that, but a child needs a dad and a woman, because there are things that only a dad can give óRUSH: Thatís old thinking.CALLER: ó and there are things only a mom can give.RUSH: See, youíre dating yourself. Thatís antiquated. Thatís been proven as socially incorrect thinking. Thatís one of these many traditions that weíve gotta bust up and blow to smithereens according to the modern era of social justice.CALLER: Yes, and look at the fruit of it!RUSH: The fruit of it? Be careful. The fruit of it? What do you mean? Oh, you mean the results?CALLER: The results, yeah!RUSH: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The results. Absolutely. Look, Rhonda, Iím so glad that you called. She said that thereís gonna be a backlash. I wonder about this. Let me go back to my proffered opinion today thatís inarguable, that the left has nothing to lose with what theyíre doing. That in and of itself constitutes what I think is a major, major cultural depravity, a major cultural descent. That a lawyer for a porn star can come out, Michael Avenatti, like he did last night, send a letterÖSend an email to one of the lawyers in the Judiciary Committee claiming that heís got a witness ó multiple witnesses ó to the fact that Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge routinely got women drunk and gave them the date rape pills so as to start a ìrape trainî at these parties. Theyíd get the women drunk and pilled up and then a train of men would go in and out of the room all night taking their turn, and heís demanding to be heard!Heís demanding that the committee let him come in and testify since theyíre gonna be talking to Christine Blasey Ford. Now, it wasnít that long ago that this kind ofÖ Even this New Yorker story features ó with no witnesses, with no corroboration ó that Kavanaugh was waving a dildo around in womenís faces. It wasnít that long ago that if you tried that, you would pay a humongous price at the polls. The most recent example of it backfiring on Democrats that I can think of would be the Wellstone Memorial in 2002. It backfired.Is it gonna backfire on them this time? By all that is decent, the Democrats in the past 10 days alone should have guaranteed that they lose seats in the House and Senate if this country is populated by a majority of decent people. There is simply no way in the America you and I grew up in that this kind of depravity and indecency is rewarded, certainly not at the ballot box. I think if you want to trace the modern beginning of the exoneration of this kind of behavior for Democrats it would be Bill Clinton and maybe prior to that.But take a look at the 180-degrees opposite treatment. Hereís Clinton who literally did what he did. Hillary Clinton knew it and became the head of the operations in the Clinton White House to discredit the women that came forward with allegations about her husband. She is rewarded for that. She is said to be a courageous victim, but she held her marriage together and she held her husbandís presidency together. She saved the Democrat Party. She is a heroine for trashing the women that came forward.Ted Kennedy murders a woman. Let me rephrase that: Ted Kennedy is present at a womanís death that he caused, and he ends up become the lion of the Senate with immense respect throughout the Washington establishment, including the Drive-By Media. Brett Kavanaugh is accused of things that there is no evidence that heís done, that there are no eyewitnesses for what heís done. In the Christine Ford story, four of the people she claims were in the room say they werenít. She canít remember the year or the place or the specific date, and yet they want to throw Brett Kavanaugh off every court!They want to deny his nomination to the Supreme Court. Itís only 20 years since these same people were trashing the kind of women they now bring forward and celebrate as heroines because they are helping to destroy a conservative. So you tell me: Where is our culture today? Where is the majority of our society? Because by all rights, evenÖ Iím gonna guess here. But I would think that even decent women looking at this would have a real, real problem with this because of the lack of any evidence, the suspiciousness of the timing, the very fact that it is totally political and orchestrated at the last minute.When theyíve failed at every other effort they made to keep Kavanaugh off the court, then this thing pops up ó suspiciously, politically ó and now theyíre finding other women when Christine Fordís story is starting to fall apart. Now weíve got dildos and ìrape trainsî and so forth and alcohol and pills and so forth. At what point do the people making these allegations just pay a general price in society at large? Yet these people think that theyíre going to sail to a massive blue wave victory in November.They believe that a majority of Americans believe as they do, that Brett Kavanaugh is filth, that Brett Kavanaugh is so disgusting, he doesnít deserve to be on the Supreme Court. They believe that they are speaking for a majority of Americans. But even if they didnít believe that, it wouldnít change what theyíre doing, because thereís no political price for them to pay, in their minds. Their base wants this! Their base is demanding this depravity.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/09/18/should-it-be-so-easy-to-end-a-career/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Sep 18, 2018RUSH: I want to ask you a couple of questions to ponder just as human beings here. Take politics out of it as much as you can when dealing with my questions. Itís impossible to totally do it, but I just want to ask: How many of you, as human beings, are capable of doing what this woman in Northern California has just done? For example and specifically, youíre minding your own business. Youíre living your life. You went to high school with people. You worked with people and all that.You are a renowned left-wing activist. You wear vagina hats on your head when Donald Trumpís elected president. No, in fact, letís not do that. Youíre just an average, ordinary person. You donít do any of that, even though this woman did. My first question is: How many of you would knowingly attempt to derail the life and career of someone you peripherally knew 35 years ago? How many of you would do that? Now, I donít know what the law of averages is. Iím sure with as many people in this country as there are that thereís a lot of creeps and a lot of vindictive people.Iím not saying it isnít possible, but how many of you wouldÖ? Do you realize how often this happens with the Democrat Party and conservative judicial nominees? But how many of you would do it? You didnít know somebody well. You didnít date them. They didnít break your heart. They didnít do anything to you that you can reallyÖ I mean, you canít remember where it happened. You canít remember even specifically what happened.This person that you are actively trying to destroy has been in public life for years, and not once in any of those occasions where his name has been mentioned publicly have you done anything to try to stop or derail it. But then this man happens to become a Supreme Court nominee. How many of you would do this? How many of you would either make up a story and send a letter? Which leads to my second question. My point is decent people justÖThis is not how people act. This is not how people think. I know thereís a lot of vindictiveness and I know thereís a lot of people that seek revenge. But that usually derives from knowing somebody well enough that whatever they did genuinely angered you or hurt you or harmed you. But this is peripheral. What kind of person does this ó and then after doing it, doesnít want to follow it through? Iím now seeing excuses being made for the fact that she doesnít want to appear at the hearing that Grassley has invited her to speak to.ìWell,î the excuse is, I, ìlook, I ó I wouldnít want to appear. I wouldnít want to have to face those questions. I wouldnít want to have to face those klieg lights. I totally understand this woman not accepting the invitation,î Iím hearing people say,î and just because she doesnít accept the invitation appear doesnít mean that sheís lying and making it up.î Okay. So weíre told by this womanís lawyer that she does not have to corroborate her allegation. Itís not up to her.We have got to prove sheís lying. She does not have to prove sheís telling the truth. That stands justice on its head. The next thing weíre being told is ìItís perfectly normal for an accuser to not want to be part of the process of getting rid of her accused. Itís perfectly normal that she wouldnít want to appear before these senators! Itís perfectly normal she wouldnít want to appear. I wouldnít,î theyíre saying. ìI wouldnít want to do.î Well, not only would youÖHow many of you would get yourselves involved in this situation in the first place, unless you are a dyed-in-the-wool political activist? My second question is a little bit more basic. Is it really this easy? Is all you have to do to derail the career of an acknowledged-as-great human being and justiceÖ? Is all youíve got to do is send a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein? Is that it? Itís that easy?Weíre to believe that all somebody has to is sent a letter, an anonymous letter ó well, a letter requesting anonymity ó to Senator Dianne Feinstein, and that alone can derail the life and the reputation and the career of a decent human being? Is it really that easy? Do we want it to be that easy? Not only is all you have to do is send a letter to Senator Dianne Feinstein, but that you will automatically be taken seriously and that you will automatically be believed. If thatís all it takes, we could start a letter writing campaign to Senator Feinstein today!Could we not?I mean, weíre being asked to really swallow a lot here, folks. Weíre being asked to believe quite a bit. These kinds of things just donít happen in the real world except when Democrats are involved and the Supreme Courtís involved. And, by the way, you know, thereís a dance everybodyís doing to avoid hitting the bullís-eye here. (interruption) What do you think the bullís-eye really is here? What do you think has the Democrats so paranoid, so frightened, so agitated, so animated and motivated to stop this guy? What is it?(interruption)Well, yeah, but why? I know they donít want him on the court. Itís one word. It begins with an A. This is all about abortion. It is about nothing else as far as the left is concerned. They want to be able to continue uninterrupted with their behavior when it comes to abortion. Sex without consequence, life without consequence. They are scared to death that a Republican or a conservative majority is going to overturn Roe vs. Wade. Now, there are other concerns too. I mean, just the fact that a majority conservative court is enough.Nobodyís talking about it. Thatís how you know that thatís what this is really about. They cannot allow anything to happen to Roe v. Wade ó and it wonít. Thatís whatís crazy about it! It wonít. But is it really just this easy? Thatís all you have to do. A letter from somebody that canít even remember where or when or for sure with who some allegation, some activity happened. Thatís all it takes. How many of you would do this? My point is, this isnít normal, folks. This is not how the normal segment of the people in our country live and operate.And yet it defines, shapes, influences the way Washington, D.C., works. And itís just another add-on as to why so many people are so fed up and disgusted because all it takes is a letter that Dianne Feinstein didnít even act on immediately. And then when she did announce it, she announced it because her colleagues were gonna leak it, and the person that wrote the letter supposedly didnít want her name used, didnít want anything done with this? Well, then why send the letter in the first place?Do you think they have given one iotaís thought to the impact this is gonna have on Brett Kavanaughís life, his wife, his two kids, all of the people with whom he comes in contact? He coaches little girls in softball and basketball or whatever. He does incredible amounts of charitable work for the needy and the homeless. You think they have the slightest concern over the fact that they are trying to destroy a career and a life and a future? I can tell you right now itís not even crossed their minds.Except to the extent that if that happens, itís justified because this guyís a conservative judge, and he deserves it! He deserves to have an excrement sandwich as his life every day. Thatís how they look at all of this. But it really got me today when I found the womanís lawyer claiming, ìItís not up to us to corroborate our charge.î (chuckling) Itís not? ìNo! We donít have to corroborate anything!î As I said, this is just textbook. This is Harry Reid calling the press and saying, ìI have a friend that told me that Mitt Romney hasnít paid his taxes in 10 years.îAnd the press said, ìWell, whoís your friend? Whereíd you get this? How long ago?îReid got mad at them. Dingy Harry got mad. ìWhat do you mean? What are you asking me for? You need to go ask Romney why he hasnít paid his taxes in 10 years!îThe press said, ìOh, yeah! Youíre right,î and they did.They left Harry Reid and they started chasing down Romney, wanted to know why he hadnít paid his taxes in 10 years. All it took was somebody, a phantom, anonymous letter to Harry Reid claiming that Mitt Romney hadnít paid taxes in 10 years ó when, in fact, he had. Now weíve got a letter to Dianne Feinstein that arrived this past July. Nothing was done with it because the Democrats tried to keep Kavanaugh off the court using everything but it.But now itís desperation time.Plan B.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: I just checked the email. Many of you are very concerned. Let me read a sample here. We had, ìDear Mr. Limbaugh. When you just said, ëWeíve all done this. Weíve all done this since high school and so forth and so on,í you better clarify what you mean. I know you were talking about underage drinking and playing spin the bottle and playing around. Yeah, but you didnít mean that weíve all held girls down against their will like this.îOf course because I donít believe that happened. Thatís the whole point here. Weíre just supposed to believe what she says because she said it and she doesnít have to corroborate it? Well, Iím gonna choose to believe Kavanaugh, folks, that it didnít happen! That he doesnít remember it happening, that he thinks itís a case of mistaken identity. I donít believe it happened! Thatís whatís driving me on this.Of course, I do not mean to say that everybody that I knew in high school practiced habitually holding women down trying to kiss íem in high school. I donít believe that happened. I was not even referring to that! Iím talking about what happens when high school kids and even junior high ó I donít care today or back then ó had parties. We all remember things, the hormonal rages, the coming of age. But I donít believe the allegation! So Iím not even talking about that.I donít believe itís what happened. MaybeÖ I got another email. ìRush, have you stopped to think that maybe this woman really liked Kavanaugh and felt rebuffed and sheís simply taking all this time to get back at him for rejecting her?î Oh, gee. How can we possibly know any of this? And if she doesnít have to corroborate any of it, then she can allege anything, and weíre supposed to accept it and try to disprove what sheís saying.And then she will not accept the invitation to come talk about it. Now, I donít even think that I have to make this clarification because this is my point. None of you would believe that I would come here and admit to engaging in behavior such as that charged by this woman. But we all, in high school, did things. We drank when we shouldnít. We snuck around our parents. This is part of growing up ó and Iím talking about the innocent kind. Donít anybody confuse things here.Kavanaugh didnít do what sheís alleging. Thatís what I choose to believe ó using intelligence guided by experience, by the way. Let me ask this. Why is it not controversial to believe what she says but very controversial to believe his denial? ëCause thatís what I choose to believe here ó and if nobody has to prove it, then what is the point? I take it back. He has to prove that it didnít happen. Do you realize how impossible that is? Thatís why our criminal justice system does not require that the accused prove it didnít happen.You accuse?You allege?You have to prove it or youíre gone.Now, in the real world, as I pointed out ó in court ó a strategy might be, because juries are juries. Your lawyer might say, ìWeíre gonna have to find out who really did this and weíre gonna have to prove they did it as a means of getting your innocence. Even though they donít have a case beyond circumstantial, we may still have to do this ícause juries are affected by prosecutors.î I understand all that. But under the rule of law, the accused has to prove. And for them to come out and say that she doesnít have to corroborate anything? Fine. Iím gonna choose to accept Kavanaugh that this didnít happen because thatís not what decent do.Pure and simple right?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So thereís this Looney Toon on ABC, Matt Dowd, Matthew Dowd. He used to be a strategerist for George W. Bush. Now heís gone left. He said, ìIf Republicans donít believe a thousand scientists on climate change, why would they believe one woman from Palo Alto?î (laughing) These peopleÖ What a strange way to try to get people to believe you. This is absurd. All of itís absurd.  "

Thatís a Russian television network. Itís an international TV network funded by the Soviets, the Russians, and they had an interview with Larry King. And heís speaking with somebody in Chattanooga aboutÖ Letís seeÖ Oh, itís Larry Kingís show! I take it back. Larry King has a show on the Russian TV network. Thatís what it is. Larry King is talking to a radio host from Chattanooga about conservative claims of bias at Facebook and Google.By the way, speaking of which, have you heard the latest outrage about Google? Google, in order to do business in China, had to accede to ChiCom demands ó and they did. And one of the things Google did is they built a prototype of the search engine, the Google search engine that will be used in China. They built a prototype for the ChiCom government that links every userís searches to their personal phone number so the ChiCom government will be able to know who everybody in China is by virtue of their phone number and what they are searching.Google, in order to do business in China, had to agree to this. The ChiCom government can now monitor peopleís search querys and will have their phone number as a means of either reaching or intimidating or just identifying them ó and Google didnít think twice. ìOkay, fine. Is that what you want? Weíll do it.î Now, if theyíre willing to stand up in partnership with a pure totalitarian, communist regime like the ChiComs, why wouldnít they if one were elected here?If a Democrat someday is elected and wants this exact kind of data from everybody using Google search, you think Google would do it for a fellow Democrat president? Theyíre showing theyíll do it for the ChiComs, and theyíll do it ícause thatís what they have to do to be in business in China. So, anyway, thereís legitimate outrage amongst conservatives at the bias. Did you hear Jack Dorsey? Did you hear Jack Dorsey, the founder, the CEO of Twitter, did you hear what he said about Twitter last week? He said that conservatives employed at Twitter literally feel unsafe to express their views at work for fear of what will be done to them by liberal employees.The Twitter CEO admitted this! He was on the Recode Decode blog, which is part of the Vox empire. It used to be part of the Wall Street Journal. He admitted it! Conservative employees at Twitter do not feel safe expressing their political opinions at work. So, anyway, Larry King with his show on the Russian television network is asking a Chattanooga radio host about conservative claims of bias at Facebook and Google. Larry King said, ìNow, reportedly Attorney General Sessions is exploring a potential investigation of social media companies because of bias against conservatives. What do you make about that?îBRIAN JOYCE: Up until the late 1980s, we had a law on the books in the United States called the Fairness Doctrine. And by law, that required radio stations, TV stations to be fair and balanced. Well, it was Republicans ó not Democrats, Republicans ó did away with that law. So I find it ironic that 30 years later theyíre complaining about bias and Facebook and bias with Google. Look. If we want to solve that problem, bring back the Fairness Doctrine, apply it to all media, including social media. But short of that, suck it up! I mean, you reap what you sow. If Facebook and Google are biased against Republicans, well, guess what? Fox News is biased against Democrats. Rush Limbaugh is biased against Democrats.RUSH: (chuckles) Okay. The Fairness Doctrine. It is clear that many people talk about it donít really know what it was or what it. By the way, hereís Larryís reaction to that. Itís only eight seconds, but weíll get it in.KING: I know. I lived with the Fairness Doctrine for a lot of years, and Iíll tell you it worked. We gave equalÖ What was wrong with giving equal time?RUSH: Hey, Larry, the Fairness Doctrine wasnít about equal time. You did an interview show, you needed guests to get your show done, you had guests from all over the place. The Fairness Doctrine was never gonna apply to you anyway. The Fairness Doctrine had nothing to do with equal time. (sigh) I get so fed up explaining this ó and the reason because everybody says if it werenít for Reagan lifting the Fairness Doctrine, this show would have never happened. Itís bohunk.The Fairness Doctrine was in place when this show actually started in Sacramento on KFBK, and it was the same show then as it now. There is no ìbiasî here. Bias is when you hide what youíre trying to persuade. We donít make any pretenses here about the fact that Iím conservative and believe in that. I donít try to hide the fact that I think liberalism sucks and is dangerous and destructive. Thereís no bias. Thereís no attempt to fool anybody here.This program is the epitome of up-front honesty. Thereís no deceit! Thereís no lying! Thereís no misdirection! Thereís none of this that is commonplace everywhere else in the Drive-By Media. The Fairness Doctrine didnít say that if I have a 30 minute monologue ripping Democrats that I have to bring Democrats in for 30 minutes and let íem react to it. Thatís the equal-time doctrine. Itís for media in politics.The Fairness Doctrine had nothing to do with that. The reason it was lifted is because was it ambiguous, difficult to enforce. It was all about balance, and radio stations have to balance to get their license approved. The way radio stationsÖ Say I have my show on every day three hours a week. It doesnít mean that it has to be followed by three hours of commie bastards saying whatever theyíre say. It just says that some time, it does.If you want to measure balance on a broadcast day, if you want to measure balance on a broadcast week, if you want to measure balance in a month, it just says that you have to bring some kind of programming thatís a little different any time you want. You donít have to balance three hours for three hours, guest for guest, any. Thatís the equal-time doctrine, and itís not applicable to a program like this. (Snort!) That would be a problem, if the equalÖ But the Fairness Doctrine was nothing that these people think that it is. The way radio stations balanceÖLook at us. Weíre the Excellence in Broadcasting Network, and we donít have another show. Are we in violation of the Fairness Doctrine? No, because itís not in place now. We wouldnít be anyway because weíre not a radio station license holder. But a station carries this show for three hours a day, which is 15 hours a week. It just means that at some point they have to carry some liberal programming or some opposition programming whenever. It doesnít have to be right after. It doesnít have to be the same time.It doesnít have to be measured in that kind of way. It just was nebulous, and thatís why it was lifted. As I say, I worked under it for three years in Sacramento, and it did not impair me in the slightest. One-day some NAALCP leader wanted to come in and complain about something eyed said. I said, ìCome on in, man. Liberals are afraid to talk to me anyway. Come on in.î He spent 30 minutes talking about Senegal and how much he loves Senegal and we have so much to learn from Senegal, and I tried to make it interesting.I did my best to make it interesting. But the Fairness Doctrineís not a suicide pact, and thatís how they want to use it. They want to employ the Fairness Doctrine to basically muzzle people. Itís typical of the left. They cannot deal with us intellectually, and they cannot deal with us politically, so they set out to destroy us. Whether itís Kavanaugh, whether itís Clarence Thomas, whether it was Romney, whether itís Trump, it doesnít matter. We do not try to destroy anybody. Thatís not the objective.We get our jollies defeating them. We get our jollies educating people to who they really are, people on the left. But destroying people? Destroying their livelihoods, their reputations, ruining them? Thatís something exclusively owned and operated by them. I keep waiting for the American people to figure it out. ìHow could at any time be more obvious?î But then I have to stop and pinch myself. The media. The media is not reporting this Kavanaugh thing in any way factually, fairly ó and if people only watch the media, theyíre not gonna learn half of the story here. (chuckles) I had other sound bites I wanted to play but Larry King got me all worked up again about what he doesnít know about broadcasting.  "

You can do that by tuning into any Washington-based media. From day to day, you can see what the narrative, the top narratives are. The soap opera script of the day. It seems today that one of the overriding concerns among the Drive-Bys is the presidentís relationship with Rod Rosenstein. The debate today centers on whether or not Rosenstein was kidding or not in a meeting with other FBI officials when he suggested wearing a wire the next time he went and talked to the president.Whatís compounding this or confusing to people is that Trump has not fired Rosenstein. In fact, he had Rosenstein up to the White House and then had him on Air Force One, flew him around and got off the airplane with him. He said they have a good working relationship. The president still will not declassify documents that Devin Nunes and a number of other people want declassified, which would answer a whole bunch of questions about the soft coup and who really started it and when and where and all of that.And the president said, ìI talked to Rosenstein ó and I, frankly, told Fox News today in the morning on the phone ó I donít understand why he wonít tell people I had a great conversation with him. Some things he told me didnít need to be under oath.î So the Drive-Bys are confused (chuckles) ícause Trump talked to Rosenstein; Rosenstein told Trump everything he wanted to know. Trump says, ìI donít see anything wrong with it.îBut then Rosenstein wonít go up to talk to Congress and Trumpís not making him do it! So people canít figure out whatís going on. Let me tell you how to observe this or how to deal with it. Trust that Trump knows what heís doing here. Thatís all I can tell you. Donít fall for the fact that Rosensteinís playing Trump. Trust the fact that Trump knows what heís doing and just be patient.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Itís Ralph in Las Vegas. Looks intriguing up there. Whatís up, Ralph?CALLER: Well, I have two questions. If you only take one, thatís fine. During the judgeís hearing, all I heard was the FBI only investigates. They do not come up with conclusions or opinions or anything.RUSH: I heard that, too.CALLER: But Fox News and the president have both bought in to fact that Connor (sic) did exactly the opposite. He was judge, jury, and not executioner, but probation officer for Hillary. He violated all of it. So why did he get away with it and nobody else can? I donít understand. I really donít.RUSH: Who is? Comey! You mean Comey.CALLER: Comey yes. Iím sorry.RUSH: I made the same point. When I heard they donít draw conclusions. Comey exonerated her before even interviewing her.CALLER: Judge, jury, and probation officer.RUSH: Right. And we all know the reason why. She was the Democrat nominee. Their jobs and futures and the shenanigans they had pulled required her to win, for them to stay employed and for the tricks they had pulled on Trump to remain unknown. So she had to be exonerated. She had to be found not guilty and not even charged in relation to the emails and the trafficking in classified data and so forth. See, I had the same reaction you do? What do you mean, you donít come to any conclusions?CALLER: I understand that, that she had to get off, but he did not have the right to. He was not a judge. It was never in trial.RUSH: No, heÖ No, wait, wait, wait. He claimed that he did because Loretta Lynch ended up having toÖ She didnít officially recuse, but because she met with Slick Willie on the plane, on the tarmac out in Phoenix, Comey said sheís compromised. So he basically took over the gig of AG for the purposes of exonerating Hillary, and he went out there on July 5th, did that press conference, under the auspices of making the decisions because Loretta Lynch couldnít.CALLER: So why canít we just reopen it and say he didnít have the legal right to make the decision; so letís start over from where he just gave his speech?RUSH: I agree with you. And this is whyÖ Youíre not the only one. Devin Nunes and a bunch of his other House members that are on the House Judiciary Committee are hell-bent on getting to the bottom of this and not letting these people get away with it. They have been uninvestigated. Thatís not the right word. They havenít even been investigated. They havenít looked at. Youíve got this special counsel which is ignoring the real crimes and criminality thatís taken place, while spending all of this time trying to find a crime that they can lay on Trump.And they havenít been able to. Itís frustrating. This is why, by the way, there is increasing frustration at the president for not declassifying these documents that will answer the questions that youíre asking. They donít understand why the president is protecting Rosenstein, the guy who, in a meeting, suggested wearing a wire in his next meeting with Trump to try to get incriminating evidence that Trumpís unfit.They were gonna gather the cabinet after Rosenstein had had a conversation with Trump, which supposedly was gonna show that Trump is insane and unfit. And they were gonna play that for the cabinet to try invoke the 25th Amendment. Rosenstein said, ìOh, Iím just kidding.î The people in the meeting said he was not kidding. None of us were. And I believe that. I believe these people back then were hell-bent on getting rid of Trump!I think they still are!I think official Washington, the political-media complex of Washington is still inside out and upside down over Trump. And I think with every success and every smile on Trumpís face, with every piece of evidence that Trump is enjoying this, I think they go a little further insane each and every time that Trump succeeds at something, that Trump is not damaged byÖ And every effort, everything that theyíve done to try to take Trump out, I think theory beyond frustrated that it hasnít worked.And I donít think they are giving up on it. I donít think they will give up on it. Now, the Rosenstein or Rosenstein, however he pronounces it, heard it both ways, this is really curious. Trump had him on Air Force One. People thought that Rosenstein, ìNo way. Heís got to be fired after this, after credibly being discovered suggesting wearing a wire to entrap the president? Heísotta go.î But Trump says I got a great relationship with the guy.Iím not letting him go. Iím not doing anything about that now, and Iím not declassifying those documents yet. People are scratching their heads as to why. Some are saying, ìItís just the election, Rush. Trumpís not gonna do any of this ítil after the midterms. Doesnít want any of this to become an election issue. Well, declassifying some of these documents that Nunes wants that would prove that there was a cabal, was running a soft coup or silent coup in the FBI, the DOJ.It would go a long way toward nullifying whatever it is that Mueller is gonna end up saying! And would establish that the deep state actually exists and has had as a project to get rid of Trump. Proof of that before the midterms would seem to be helpful. Then thereís the aspect of this that the allies in Europe, our European allies, a primarily the British, have asked the president not to declassify. (impression) ìItíd be terribly, terribly humiliating, donít you know. Terribly embarrassing.The Brits are very, very close allies of ours, and there have been some questionable behavior on their part, and then certainly wouldnít want that knowb.î And the president said, ìOkay. Okay. Iím not gonna embarrass you.î By the way, every bit of thatís true. This whole thing has been a circus involving academics from Cambridge, Harvard, Yale, and Oxford, as they intermingle with the CIA, the FBI, and MI6 in the U.K. I mean, academics and spies are pretty much the same people.The CIA and MI6 recruit students from the Ivy League and from Oxford and Cambridge and the U.K. ícause theyíre looking for smarts and, in many cases, theyíre looking for left-wing tilt. Donít ask me why, other than the obvious reasons. But Trump has chosen to protect the wishes of our British allies, primarily, and not declassifying some of theseÖ Itís got Devin Nunes frustrated like you canít believe. And some of his buddies that are on the committee as well.But back to your original question about the FBI not drawing conclusions. Comey did. They certainly concluded that Trump committed all these crimes and Trump this and Trump that. But in truth theyíre not supposed to. In truth, they are information gatherers. In the case of Kavanaugh, the task, the job, WAS to go out and re-interview people already been interviewed and turn over the 302s, the interview forms, the results of the interviews to the Senate! To the Judiciary Committee. And they draw the conclusions. Thatís how itís always been.Look, Iím glad you called out there, Ralph, but I gotta go.  "
RUSH,https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2018/10/11/if-democrats-are-headed-to-a-landslide-victory-why-are-they-so-angry/,"For a better experience, download and use our app!Oct 11, 2018RUSH: For example, let me ask a generic question. We had Eric Holder out there, whoís campaigning for somebody to be governor of Georgia. Holderís supposedly gonna run for president himself in 2020. Eric Holder, the attorney general for Barack Hussein O, was involved in many scandals himself. And Iím seeing a lot of people on our side in the so-called conservative intelligentsia shocked that Eric Holder would say what he said.You know, Michelle (My Belle) Obama is out there saying, ìNo, no. My motto is, ëWhen they go low, we go high,'î and Holder said screw that! ìWhen they go low,î meaning RepublicansÖ ìWhen they go low, we kick them!î So people said, ìMy God. Heís out there inciting violence,î and he said, ìNo, no, no! I didnít mean it literally. Iím saying that we canít take it anymore. We have to stop being the nice guys and stop taking it anymore.îHe did mean it. Obama meant it when he said, ìThey bring a knife; we bring a gun.î Obama meant it. So does Maxine Waters when theyíre both encouraging people to get in our faces. They mean it! They are already inciting violence. Theyíre inciting violence inside Capitol Hill buildings and elevators. Theyíre engaging in bullying tactics. My question is, ìWhy? Why are the Democrats doing all this? Why are they inciting violence?îLetís look at the things that they think are supposedly on their side, things that are helpful to them. We start with the fact that they are convinced that theyíre gonna win control of the House. Itís already done. The blue wave, itís just a matter of the days on the calendar passing by until we get to Election Day, where we can confirm that the Democrats already won. Remember, we had a poll from CNN and a sound bite John King couple weeks ago.He cited a poll indicated the House races are over. Their poll said that the Democrats are likely winners of the House of Representatives. So itís over. In their minds, theyíve won the House. In their minds, theyíve almost won the Senate. They have the Mueller report. And the Mueller report is gonna link Trump to Russia; right? They know that Muellerís got the goods. Oh, they can taste it. Ho-ho-ho-ho. Folks, they can scratch their backs with it. They just can.They know that Mueller has secretly collected the goods. They know that Mueller is gonna issue a report, and itís gonna tie Trump and Russia, and itís gonna prove that Trump stole the election from Hillary and that Hillary should be president. That should make them happy, right? Why all the desperation? CNN engaging in full-fledged, 1,000% racism directed at Kanye West. (Media impression), ìYeah, Kanye West is what happens to a Negro when he stops reading.îThatís what they said on CNN, with Don Lemon laughing and yukking it all up. It wasnít that long ago the cover of TIME magazineÖ When was this? In 2005, the Drive-By Media proclaimed Kanye West ìThe Smartest Man in Pop Music ó Hip-Hopís Class Act. Defying the rules of rap, Kanye West goes his own way.î So what would that be? Thirteen years ago? Kanye West was the future. Kanye West was the hero! But now, Kanye West is having lunch at the White House today with Trump as is Jim Brown.By the way, Trump is funny today. (Media impression) ìWhy did you do that rally? Why did you do that rally with the hurricane coming and climate change destroying Florida? Why didÖ?î Trump said, ìYou know what? You have a point. But there were people that have been lined up for a day and a half to get in to see the rally. I couldnít disappoint them. I had to go, and it was a great time.î Trump just slam-dunked íem on a number of things in a short little press availability at the White House.So now a CNN panel calls Kanye West a ìtoken Negro.îìBlack folks are about to trade Kanye West in the racial draft, okay? Theyíve had it with him,î they said. ìNow all of the sudden because heís put on a MAGA hat and heís an attention whore like the president, heís all of the sudden the model spokesperson. Heís the token negro of the Trump administration.î This is ìridiculous.î says the CNN panel.Why are they so mad, folks? Why all the separation? Theyíre gonna win the House, theyíre gonna win the Senate, Mueller is gonna prove that Trump colluded with Russia. Between inciting violence and launching racist attacks, we are witnessing an attempt to bully the American population into surrender. That is whatís happening here.Their soft coup failed. Now itís time for the second phase. The soft coup, thatís where Rosenstein and the rest of the guys are gonna wiretap Trump and are gonna wire Trump, wear a wire and get Trump indicting himself for certain things he was saying, theyíre gonna get rid of Trump, the FBI, the DOJ, the Clinton administration, the soft coup, it didnít work. Remaining silent about the Scalise shooting should have been a clue of the Democratsí depravity and intentions.What I mean by that, there was actually a shooting of Republicans at baseball practice in preparation of a joint Republican-Democrat baseball game, a traditional, annual thing, and a lunatic, deranged Democrat fundraiser-donor-supporter from Illinois shows up, starts firing, and almost kills Steve Scalise. And the Democrats didnít say anything about it, and the media didnít condemn it; there wasnít any condemnation. There was an overwhelming silence.That should have been, and it was to me a clue, to the Democrat depravity and their intentions. Now weíve got Hillary. Now we got Maxine Waters. Eric Holder explicitly directing Democrats to physically attack Republicans, with CNN going full racist on a prominent, black Trump supporter. By the way, they can see the polls. Trump approval number in the African-American community is 35%. One year ago, it was 23%. Thatís on the upswing. Democrats are strangely angry at a time when they think everything is going their way.Letís look specifically at some Democrat strategies. How the Democrats have decided they want to defeat Republicans. No. 1, and in no particular order here send ricin. Send poison to the offices of Republicans. Shoot them at softball games. Kick them. Blacklist them. Get in their faces at public places. Falsely accuse Republicans of sexual assault over and over and over. Falsely accuse Republicans of tax evasion. Hello, Mitt Romney.Falsely accuse Republicans of colluding with Russia to win the election. Falsely accuse Republicans of racism. Register illegal immigrants to vote by giving them driverís licenses. Create and publish phony polls. Indoctrinate students. This is the sum total of the Democrats. WhyÖ? Do you notice whatís not on the Democrat list of things, strategies to win the elections? Ideas. Policies. The only thing the Democrats have? (summarized) ìGet rid of Republicans because itís ours. Get rid of the Republicans because we own it.ìGet rid of Republicans because power is ours. Itís our entitlement. Itís our birthright.î No issues. No ideas. Not anything promoting because they canít and donít dare be honest about it. I just find it strange. All of this negativism and panic and hysteria and paranoia from people who are so convinced that theyíre right and so convinced that America agrees with them; so convinced that the American people want them back in power. Why, then, all of this rage and paranoia and anger?BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: How about this, folks: ìPassenger with Emotional Support Squirrel Escorted off Jet ó A female passenger was removed from a Frontier Airlines flight after bringing an emotional support squirrel on board the plane, the company confirmed on Wednesday. Police in Orlando, Fla., had to have all passengers exit the plane to deal with the passenger after she refused to deplane on TuesdayÖîAn emotional support squirrel? The first thing I thought of was: I wonder if this woman happened to be flying home from Washington after a weekend clawing on the doors at the Supreme Court or trying to harass Republicans in the halls of the Senate Office Building. ìHudson Valley Man Arrested After Allegedly Planning to Blow Himself Upî because heís upset about Trump.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Yeah. So not only do we have a female passenger traveling with an emotional support squirrel, a rodentÖ You know, Frontier Airlines had to point out to people that we do not allow rodents on our airplanes, and a squirrelÖ I know they look cute, but a squirrel is nothing but a tree rat. Thatís all it is. It has a little cuter face and has a bushy tail out there, but itís a tree rat. Itís a rodent, and Frontier Airlines doesnít allow them on their airplanes.People say, ìThat was just so mean. She needs her support squirrel!î Wouldnít it be great if this is one of these babes that lost their minds in Washington over the Kavanaugh stuff? And then there was this: ìA Hudson Valley, New York, man was arrested after allegedly planning to blow himself up on the Washington Mall around Election Day because heís upset about the countryís direction.î Now, who do you think this guyís gonna vote for?This guyís obviously gonna vote for the nearest Democrat he can find. This is how theyíre being inspired? Further evidence that the Democrats are not about ideas and not about inspiring people to vote for them because of the great improvements that will happen in their lives. Nancy Pelosi. Right here. ìNancy Pelosi: Trumpís Tax Returns a Top Priority if Democrats Win the House.î Now, how is that gonna benefit your average Democrat voter? Well, Iíll tell you how.The Democrats have so poisoned their voters; Democrat voters want revenge. Not a job, not a raise, not a bonus. They want revenge, and they hate Trump. So anything the Democrats can do to harm Trump, why, the Democrats will vote for whoever will promise to make Trump suffer. You think thatís a majority of people? You think thatís the kind of stuff that creates a blue wave? I donít. I donít believe that the country is that deranged. But the Democrats are counting on the fact. They think it is.Okay. To the phones. Ben in Fresno. Youíre up first today. Great to have you with us, sir. Hi.CALLER: Hey, Rush. Thanks for having me on.RUSH: Yes, sir.CALLER: So I was there. I was in D.C. for the three days of the nonsense last week. I saw them screaming and yelling and attacking us and the folks. So what I felt was, this is all they have. The reason that they continue, the reason that Don Lemonís saying the nonsense heís saying on CNN, the reason that they just continue with this game plan is ícause itís the only game plan they have. And theyíre hoping that the American people are dumb enough told them buy it, but I believe that the American peopleÖ Even in California where Iím at, the American people are seeing this crap, and theyíre like, ìThis is an old game. We donít buy it anymore,î and they have nothing else to play. Thereís nothing else for them to do; so they just keep doing the same nonsense. And the look in their eyes? Itís like they know theyíre losing, they know weíre not buying it anymore, but theyíve got nothing else to say.RUSH: Now, hold on here. Thatís an interesting point, because if they do have the maturity and presence of mind, they do have to realize theyíre losing. Trump won. Trump is getting elements of agenda either passed or implemented. Kavanaugh was confirmed. Everything theyíve done to stop Trump ó everything, from the judges to the courts, travel ó not much has worked. And so I think youíre right. They do realize theyíre losing. And you think theyíre in a fit of desperation, that theyíve got nothing else to do; thatís why theyíre not proposing any ideas to counter Trumpís.CALLER: Absolutely.RUSH: Thatís why theyíre not proposing any new policies to counter Trumpís, ícause they donít have any.CALLER: Absolutely. The left loses when theyíre exposed. The right loses when weíre silent. For so long, theyíve expected us to just shut up and go away at some point.RUSH: Thatís true too. I think they have become accustomed to Republicans caving, and Republican voters and certainly conservative media ó well, some conservative media ó caving as well. I think theyíve gotten accustomed to bullying working, the threats.CALLER: Lying. Yep. Threats. Lying. All of that. And theyíre hoping that itís gonna work again. And the only way it works is if we donít show up. Thatís why you see the polling data still showing them winning. Thatís why it showed Hillary was gonna win in a landslide because they know that if they can dissuade us, if they can discourage us enough to make us not show up, thatís the only way they win. But if Republicans, if conservatives stand up, weíll win every single time. We just have to show up. We have to convince other people to show up and convince them to convince other people to show up.RUSH: You say you were in Washington for three days. What did you actually see? What kind of activities were they engaged in that you saw?CALLER: Oh, I was right in the middle of it. I was live streaming the whole time. I went right up to Linda Sarsour and told her. Theyíre out there saying stuffÖ (unintelligible) Theyíre out there saying, you know, ìBelieve women and stop the assault on women,î and my question to Linda was, ìWhat does Islam do to women? How does IslamÖ? Youíre out here promoting Islam and Islam oppressesÖîRUSH: And you get no answer because youíre not supposed to ask it. Linda Sarsour is the Palestine Liberation Organization apologist disguised as a feminist advocate. She was at the Supreme Court leading that clawing at the door.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Hereís Larry in Pine River, Wisconsin. Iím glad you waited, Larí. How are you?CALLER: Good. How are you?RUSH: Iím good. Iím very good. Thank you.CALLER: Is a real privilege to be speaking with you.RUSH: Well, thank you, sir, very much.CALLER: I just have a thought to give to you. As unhinged as the left has become and now theyíre advocating violence, this really shouldnít come as a surprise to us. This has been going on on our college campuses for decades. Theyíve been trying to silence conservatives on campuses, and itís just seems to be a situation now that if it worked so well on campuses, why donít we take it nationwide?RUSH: Iíll tell you something, Larí. I think youíve nailed it. In fact, I heard noted scholar and farmer, Victor Davis Hanson, who is a senior fellow and thinker at the Hoover Institute (itís at the Stanford campus in Palo Alto) say the same thing. He basically said what you just said, that the campus has come to American life. He made the same points that you just did, is that this that this violence and intolerance and bullying and so forth has now become mainstream left-wing cultural belief and behavior. So youíre in great company there with your thinking. Thatís is exactly right. The question then becomes, you know, how do you get it back and relegated to the campus ó and then how do you kick it out of there?  "

Iíd like to ask unanimous consent to submit for the record five articles, including one titled, ìWhy Sexual AssaultÖîRUSH: Okay. Okay. We can JIP out. Chris Coons is gonna take his time.

I didnít expect it to be as long as it was gonna be. So it was a little bit stressful.MITCHELL: Have you ever given tips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test?FORD: Never.

I wasnít listening to every detail about what ó whether it was audio or video recorded.MITCHELL: Well, you were in a hotel room; right?FORD: Correct.MITCHELL: Uh, regular hotel room with a bed and bathroom?FORD: No, no, no. It was a conference room. So I was sitting at a chair and he was behind me.MITCHELL: Did you notice any cameras in the room?FORD: Uh, well, he had a computer set up. So I guess I assumed that he was somehow taping and recording me.RUSH: You just said you didnít think so!MITCHELL: Okay, so you assumed you were being video and audio recorded?FORD: Correct.MITCHELL: But you donít know for sure?FORD: I donít know for sure.MITCHELL: Okay.

Letís take another brief time-out, as we continue here on the EIB Network.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: The hearing has resumed. Iím gonna JIP it here again. Mazie Hirono is now questioning Dr. Ford. Thanks for the call and letís put it back up here.HIRONO: Öshe will persist in asking these questions all to undermine the memory and basically the credibility of Dr. Ford. But we all know, Dr. Fordís memory of the assault is very clear. Dr. Ford, the Republicanís prosecutor has asked you all kinds of questions about who you called and when, asking details that would be asked in a cross-examination of a witness in a criminal trial, but this is not a criminal proceeding. This is a confirmation proceeding! I think I know what she óRUSH: Wrong, Senator. Youíre running a criminal trial here!HIRONO: ó very plainly, Dr. Ford. Is there a political motivation for your coming forward with your of the assault by Brett Kavanaugh?FORD: No, and Iíd like to reiterate that, again, I was trying to get the information to you while there was still a list of other ó (interruption) thank you ó what looked like fully qualified candidates.RUSH: Okay.HIRONO: And yet theyíre not here to testify. Dr. Ford, Iíd like to join my colleagues who have thanked you for coming forward today, and I ó and we ó all admire you for what you are doing, and I understand why you have come forward. You wanted us and the American people to know what you knew about the character ó the character of the man we are considering for a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court. I want to take a moment also to note the significant personal sacrifices youíve made to come forward to share your traumatic experience with us and the American people. Youíve had to move, youíve had death threats, all manner of ó of (chuckling), basically re-victimization experiences have come your ways. (sic)RUSH: Gotta make a note about this, folks, to remember to tell you something.HIRONO: But by coming forward, you have reintroduced the question of character into this nomination and hopefully back to American life, and rightly so. We should be made to face the question of who it is we are putting in positions of power and decision-making in this country. We should look the question square if the face: Does character matter? Do our values, our real values about what is right and what is wrong óRUSH: Hey! Does her character matter, Senator?HIRONO: ó and when we treat our fellow human beings with dignity and respect? Do they matter anymore?RUSH: What about hers?HIRONO: I believe they do, and I believe the reaction we have seen to this coverage right now and your courage all of this country shows us that weíre not alone. Youíre not alone.RUSH: What is this ìweî?HIRONO: Women and men all across America are disgusted and tired of the way basic human dignity has been driven from our public life.RUSH: HA! HA! HA! Really? Thatís a good one.HIRONO: The president admits on tape to assaulting women. He separates children from their parents. He takes basic health care protections from those who need them most. He nominates and stands behind a man who stands credibly accused of a horrible act. I again want to thank you for coming forward. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that six items consisting of various statements, letters, fact sheets, uh, posts are inserted into the record.GRASSLEY: Uh, is that one request or do you want me to wait for six?HIRONO: Well, I have six separate items.GRASSLEY: Okay.HIRONO: BecauseÖ I can go over them for you.GRASSLEY: Okay. No.HIRONO: I would like to óGRASSLEY: Let me not interrupt you. Your request is accepted without objection.HIRONO: Thank you. And I would like to read from a, uh ó an item that has already been entered into the record. But this is from a letter from the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence. The letter states ó and I quote this letter ó ìDo we start by believing victims of sexual assault and treating them with dignity, or donít we?So far, Senate leaders are failing that test. Prejudging the outcome of the hearing. Sympathizing with her perpetrator. Attacking her credibility. Ö They send a message to every victim of sexual violence that their pain doesnít matter, that they do not deserve justice [and], that ó for them ó fair treatment is out of reach. This will only serve to drive victims into the shadows and further [embolden] abusers.î Once again, Dr. Ford, thank you very much. This is a moment for our country.RUSH: Huh-shhh! It sure as hell is.GRASSLEY: SenatorÖ Uh, Ms. Mitchell for Senator Crapo.RUSH: Okay. Letís see what happens here.MITCHELL: Um, when we left off, we were still talking about the polygraph óRUSH: Oh! (chuckling)MITCHELL: ó and I believe you said it hasnít been paid for yet. Is that correct?KATZ: Let me put an end to this mystery. Her lawyers have paid for her polygraph.BROMWICH: As is routine.KATZ: As is routine.MITCHELL: Dr. Ford, do you expect the price of that polygraph to be passed on to you?FORD: Iím not sure yet. I havenít taken a look at all of the costs involved in this. Uh, weíve relocated now twice, so I havenít kept track of all that paperwork. But Iím sure I have a lot of work to do to catch up on all of that later.RUSH: (laughing) For crying out loud. What? (laughing)MITCHELL: Youíve had a lot going on and youíve had there for several months.RUSH: (impression) ìI donít know. IÖî (sigh)MITCHELL: Is it your understanding that someone else is going to assist you with some of these fees including the costs for your polygraph?FORD: Iím aware that there have been several GoFundMe sites. I havenít had a chance to figure out how to manage those ícause Iíve never had one.MITCHELL: Iím sorry, several what?FORD: GoFundMe sites that have raised money for my óRUSH: The prosecutor even know what it is.FORD: ó security detail; so Iím not even quite sure how to collect that money or how to distribute it yet.RUSH: Your lawyers will figure that out. Probably already have.MITCHELL: Um, in your testimony this morning, um, you stated that Senator Feinstein sent you a letter on August 31st of this year. Is that right?FORD: (long pause) August 31st?RUSH: (impression) ìSee, I donít remember. My lawyers are having to consult withÖ Iím really lost here. I donítÖ Letís see.îFORD: I got her letter on July 30th, and I donít have the date.RUSH: Yeaaaah?FORD: Iíd have to pull up my email to find out the date of her email to me saying that. It was right before the hearings that she was going to maintain the confidentiality of the letter.MITCHELL: Say that again. It was ítil right before the hearings that what?FORD: My memory, but I can look it up for you. If you would like the exact date, I can pull it up on my email.MITCHELL: Yeah. I just óBROMWICH: Counsel?MITCHELL: I want to make sure I understood what she ó you said.KATZ: That documentís been turned over to ó in response to a request for documents. You have it.MITCHELL: Thank you, Counsel. Um, I want to make sure I understood what you said. Uh, was it your understanding it was going to be kept confidential up until right before the hearing?FORD: It was my understanding it was gonna be kept confidential, period.MITCHELL: Period? Okay. Um, between your polygraph on August the 7th and your receipt of the letter from Senator Feinstein, did you or anyone on your behalf speak to any member of Congress or congressional staff about these allegations?RUSH: Ohhhh.FORD: I personally did not.MITCHELL: So my question was did you or anybody on your behalf.FORD: I donítÖ What do you mean? Did someone speak for me?MITCHELL: Somebody that is working with you or helping you. Did somebody at your behest, on your behalf speak to somebody in Congress or staff?FORD: Iím not sure.RUSH: (impression) ìI donít know.îFORD: I donít know how those exchanges meant.RUSH: (impression) ìHow does that help me get rid of Kavanaugh? What does that have to do with getting rid of Kavanaugh?îMITCHELL: Is it possible that somebody did?FORD: I think so. It would be possible.RUSH: ìWhat does this have to do with getting rid of Kavanaugh?î sheís saying.MITCHELL: Okay.KATZ: Excuse me. You asked her not to guess and now youíre asking her whatís possible. So I think if you want to ask her what she knows, you should ask her what she knows.(crosstalk)RUSH: This is just like a deposition! Itís exactly what a deposition looks like, which is not whatís called for here. But weíll stick with it, folks. We gottaÖFORD: (whispering) I donít understand.RUSH: (impression) ìI donít understand. How does this help get rid of the judge?îGRASSLEY: You should answer the question unless thereís a legal reason for not answering it, uh, on advice of your counsel.FORD: So, I donít totally understand the question, but I didnít speak with anyone during that time frame, other than my counsel.MITCHELL: Okay. Um, youíve said repeatedly that you did not, uh, think that that letter that you wrote on July 30th was going to be released to the public. Is that correct?FORD: Correct.MITCHELL: And is it true that you did not authorize it to be released at any time?FORD: Correct.MITCHELL: Okay. Uh, besides your attorneys, did you provide ó you provided that letter to Senator Feinstein, is that correct?FORD: I provided her a letter on July 30th.MITCHELL: Weíre talking about the July 30th letter.FORD: Okay.RUSH: Right.MITCHELL: And you provided that letter to Senator Feinstein, correct?FORD: (silent)MITCHELL: Is that a ìyesî?FORD: Yes.MITCHELL: And you provided the letter to, uh, Representative Eshoo to deliver to Senator Feinstein?FORD: Yes.MITCHELL: Besides those two individuals ó Representative Eshoo and Senator Feinstein ó and your attorneys, did you provide that letter to anyone else?FORD: No.MITCHELL: Do you know how that letter became public?FORD: No.MITCHELL: (whispers) Okay. (full voice) After that letter was made public or leaked, did you reach back out to the Washington Post?RUSH: Ugh. This is painful. She doesnít have the slightest clue whatís going on here, folks.FORD: Um, I reached out to the WashingtonÖ Well, they were continuously reaching out to me, and I was not responding. Um, but the time that I did respond and agreed to do the sit-down was once the reporters started showing up at my home and at my workplace.MITCHELL: Okay.MAN: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Ford, um, th-thank you for being here.RUSH: Okay. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. No, weíre not. Weíre gonna bump out right now. Timing worked out perfectly.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Spartacus is doing the questioning. Heís not really questioning Dr. Ford, who looksÖ Sheís in a side view right now. It looks like sheís on the verge of tears here. Some people think sheís stalling by acting like she doesnít understand these questions, stalling as to prevent as many questions being asked as possible. Cory Booker just said ó and Chris Coons said it, too ó that theyíre both getting overwhelmed with phone calls in their Senate offices from people who now realize that they have been raped or they are being sexually abused, and that Dr. Ford is an awakening a new unit of America.She is inspiring ó with her courage ó numbers and numbers of people to finally come forward. Spartacus and Chris Coons are saying this is a wonderful, wonderful thing here. Now I have a story. I was waiting for this. ìBoys More Likely to Be Victims of Teen Dating Violence than Girls, Study Shows.î You want to talk about phone calls? I can tell you this. I have been told by some ranking Republican staff people for members of the House and Senate that a lot of women are alarmed at all of this because of what itís doing to their sons, what this is maybe going to cause to happen to their sons, this characterization of boys thatís taking place here.In other words, this may be backfiring in a sense on some people with women who donít like whatís being done to their sons in this whole process.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Letís rejoin as the Republican prosecutor is again querying the witness.MITCHELL: This is not a cognitive interview. Um, did anybody ever advise you ó from Senator Feinsteinís office or from Representative Eshooís office ó to go get a forensic interview?FORD: (long pause) No.MITCHELL: Instead, you were advised to get an attorney and take a polygraph. Is that right?FORD: Many people advised me to get an attorney. Um, once I had an attorney, my attorney and I discussed using the polygraph.MITCHELL: And instead of submitting to an interview in California, weíre having a hearing here today in five-minute increments. Is that right?FORD: I ó I agree thatís what was agreed upon by the collegial (sic) group here.MITCHELL: Thank you. I have no further questions.GRASSLEY: Okay, uh, I have something to submit for the record. We received, uh, three statements under penalty of felony from three witnesses identified by Dr. Ford, Mark Judge, Leland Keyser, and Patrick Smith. All three denied any knowledge of the incident or gathering described by Dr. Ford. Without objection, Iíll enter in the record.BROMWICH: Mr. Chairman, I have, uh, something for the record as well, a number of letters from the witnessís family, friends, including her husband.GRASSLEY: Okay. Uh, Iíll get to you just soon as the ranking member.FEINSTEIN: Mr. Chariman, uh, I have three letters addressed to both you and, um, the ranking member and Iíd ask that they be entered into the record.GRASSLEY: Without objection.FEINSTEIN: And itís also my understanding that Mr. Judge is not willing to come forward to answer our questions. Um, as a result, we cannot test his memory or make any assessment of his thoughtfulness or character. Ummm.RUSH: No, he just denied it under oath, thatís all.FEINSTEIN: Thatís why the failure to call him to testify is so very critical, and I hope the majority would reconsider that.RUSH: Yeah. Right. (grumbling)GRASSLEY: Senator Blumenthal?BLUMENTHAL: Mr. Chairman, I ask if you have sworn statements that youíre submitting for the record, that we have those individuals come before us so that we can ask some questions about those statements. I think that the nature of this proceeding would be compromised if we lack an opportunity to ask them questions about sworn statements that will be part of the record. So frankly, uh, Mr. Chairman, I would object to entering them in the record.WHITEHOUSE: Mr. Chairman?GRASSLEY: Senator Whitehouse?WHITEHOUSE: I have a number of letters that I would like to ask submitted, uh, to the record, ummm, that relate to the importance of proper investigation by trained professionals in pulling, uh, these kind of ó of, uh, investigations together from the leadership conference on human rights, the National Womenís Law Center, the National Organization for Women, and so forth.GRASSLEY: Without objection. (crosstalk) Senator Kennedy?KENNEDY: Mr. Chairman, I have a question for our chairman. The ó the statements, uh, that Senator Blumenthal talked about? Those were statements taken by our majority staff, is that right?GRASSLEY: Theyíre already in the record.KENNEDY: Yes, sir, but those statements were taken by majority staff?GRASSLEY: Yes.KENNEDY: Uh, did majority staff participate?GRASSLEY: No.KENNEDY: Why not?GRASSLEY: Uh, youíll have to asked them.KENNEDY: Well, were they instructed not to participate?GRASSLEY: No.KENNEDY: They chose not to?GRASSLEY: Thatís right.FEINSTEIN: I-i-if I may, Mr. Chairman, Iím told that minority staff was not notified.KENNEDY: If I could, I still think I have the floor, Mr. Chairman.GRASSLEY: Letís listen to Senator Feinstein.BROMWICH: Can we be excused?GRASSLEY: UmÖ UhÖFEINSTEIN: I am told by staff óBROMWICH: Um, uh, the witness is very tired.(crosstalk)GRASSLEY: If youíd wait just a minute, Iíd like to judgment thank Dr. Ford.BROMWICH: All right.GRASSLEY: In fact, weíre gonna continue this meeting. We can, uh, uhÖ So letís just be nice to her.(ripple of laughter)GRASSLEY: Dr. Ford? Dr. Ford, I ó I can only speak of one of 21 senators here, but I thank you very much for testimony, and more importantly for your bravery coming out and trying to answer our questions as best you could remember. Thank you very much. Weíll adjourn for 45 minutes ó or, not adjourn, take a break for 45 minutes.RUSH: I guess thatís it. Sheís finished. Thatís it! Thatís it. The Democrats are flooding the zone with letters from this and that claiming that didnít happen, that should happen, the Republicans stink, the Republicans are mean, the Republicans are racist ó and the Democrats want to submit all those letters. The big deal hereÖ Grassley announced it and then the Democrats immediately flooded the zone so everybody forget it. But Grassleyís got sworn affidavits from her three witnesses claiming it didnít happen!And their sworn affidavits, as he said, are ìunder penalty of felony.î Meaning felony perjury! ìSee you later. Hereís the orange jumpsuit. Say good-bye to anybody that you care about ícause itís gonna be a few years before you see íem.î They have signed these sworn affidavits. The incident didnít happen! They were not there. And one of them is her best friend or at the time a good friend of hers, Leland Keyser ó who, by the way, as an added little bit of information, used to be married to Bob Beckel. (interruption)Yeah, this Blasey Ford, one of her best friends was married to Bob Beckel for a few years. So Leland Keyser has obviously has run in Democrat activist circles, and she is saying the incident didnít happen. Dr. Ford places her there! Dr. Ford says she was there. In one of her more lucid moments, she said she doesnít remember everything, but she does remember enough to put her there. Anyway when Grassley entered those three into the record, thatís when the Democrats lost their cookies and started introducing tiddlywinks and Monopoly money and everything else into the record to try to cover it up.Thereís another lie that Blumenthal and all these Democrats are saying, and thatís that Mark Judge has not testified. He has! The committee staff, the Senate Judiciary Committee staff has interviewed Mark Judge. He has testified. Well, he has submitted to questions. He hasnít testified but he has been interviewed under oath by the Judiciary Committee staff. Richard Blumenthal, who is such a stranger to the truth anyway, is still out there lying about it! And heís not the only one.We had Senator Kamala Harris, who has been flooding Facebook with 3600 ads, anti-Kavanaugh ads. She ended by saying that Blasey has nothing to gain by doing this, which caused Blasey to start tearing up. Never mind that she has a lot to gain. She gonna be a hero to all of her beach buddies out in Santa Cruz. The books? The movie deals? The DemocratsÖ If KavanaughÖ Well, it doesnít matter. If Kavanaughís confirmed or not, this woman is now in Anita Hillís league, and she will be made a heroine. She will get book deals.An incident that she doesnít know where, when, or what will be written about in a 400-page memoir for which she will be given a Hillary Clinton-type advance of $10 million. Because the publishers and everybody else will make the mistake of thinking the American people canít get enough of Christine Ford (theyíre gonna make that mistake), just like they think they couldnít get enough of Hillary. All this is coming, and this is gonna be the HBO movie. So what do you mean nothing to lose, nothing to gain?This is absolutely absurd. Sheís got everything in the world to gain. She can quit her job. She doesnít have to pay her lawyers anything. So now weíll have to find out if anybody thought that the Republican prosecutor succeeded in linking Christine Ford to the Democrat Party and this whole thing as being nothing more than a Democrat Party strategic operation, which, folks, thatís what it is! All of this today is designed to cloud and make murky the issue. Just start with the timing of this.The fact that Kavanaugh has been nominated to several courts and the woman never popped up once. She pops up and supposedly doesnít want to be known but is and doesnít have seem to have a problem with it now. She shows up at the last moment, after it looks like the Democrats have failed in their quest to keep Kavanaugh off the court. Thereís no question the Democrat Partyís behind this. Thatís what they do! This is why I think thereís going to be some kind of a backlash in November.By the way, remember all of the times we had polling data on the midterms back in May and June, and I would caution everybody to remember, ìThe events that are gonna shape the November elections havenít even happened yet.î Well, this is one of those events. Now that itís happened, this is gonna shape them. Itís gonna have some impact on the November elections. We donít know yet what. We donít know if thereís gonna be a backlash against Democrats. By all rights, there should be.We donít know if thereís gonna be a backlash against Republicans for not stopping this, for not having the vote earlier, for falling prey to yet another Democrat stall technique. Itís up for grabs right now as to what the outcome of this will be. By the way, Richard Blumenthal ó who lied about valorous service in Vietnam ó objected to the affidavits of the three people named by Ford as not being at the incident. They werenít there. It didnít happen. As far as they know, it wasnít there.Blumenthal objected to those being put in the record without those three being brought forward in chains to be queried and interrogated about it. Grassley pointed out the Democrats refused to be at the committee when those affidavits were made! Grassley reminded him: You had a chance to talk to these people and you didnít! The Democrats refused to be part of the interview with Judge or any of the other four witnesses. They have been interviewed by this committee. The Democrats chose not to show up and are now lying to everybody about the fact they were left out of the process. They were not!  "
