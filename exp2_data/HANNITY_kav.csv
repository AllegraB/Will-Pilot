I denied the allegation immediately, unequivocally, and categorically. The next day, I told this Committee that I wanted to testify as soon as possible, under oath, to clear my name.Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired. There has been a frenzy to come up with something-anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious-that will block a vote on my nomination. These are last-minute smears, pure and simple. They debase our public discourse. And the consequences extend beyond any one nomination. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination-if allowed to succeed-will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country.As I told this Committee the last time I appeared before you, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. That is the kind of judge I am and will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. This effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. I am here this morning to answer these allegations and to tell the truth. And the truth is that I have never sexually assaulted anyone-not in high school, not in college, not ever.Sexual assault is horrific. It is morally wrong. It is illegal. It is contrary to my religious faith. And it contradicts the core promise of this Nation that all people are created equal and entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Allegations of sexual assault†must be taken seriously. Those who make allegations deserve to be heard. The subject of allegations also deserves to be heard. Due process is a foundation of the American rule of law.Dr. Fordís allegation dates back more than 36 years, to a party that she says occurred during our time in high school. I spent most of my time in high school focused on academics, sports, church, and service. But I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now. But thatís not why we are here today. What Iíve been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior. I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes.The allegation of misconduct is completely inconsistent with the rest of my life. The record of my life, from my days in grade school through the present day, shows that I have always promoted the equality and dignity of women.I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford. I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford. I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in someplace at some time. But I have never done that to her or to anyone. I am innocent of this charge."

Hrabar is also a leader for the D.C. chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and back in June, she made headlines when she led an unhinged protest against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielson at a Mexican restaurant.According to the Metro D.C. Democratic Socialists website, the group, believes in ìa radical restructuring of our economic and political systems to value people over profits. Rather than our current economy, which is controlled by the wealthy few for their own benefit, we envision an economy that is democratically controlled by all Americans.îHrabar is also caught on video discussing how her colleague at the Department of Agriculture purposefully slows down the implementation of new food stamp policies put in place by President Trump.ìWe have a member who works for the people who distribute food stamps, and they can like take that away, and theyíre slowing what they do,î she said. †ìI wait until, I have to submit a merger form on the 30th day, by the 30th. Iím supposed to do it at 5, sometimes I do it at like ten to 5.îWhen asked to clarify her comments, Hrabar said, ìIt just means that they canít start doing anything so itís very small, mine is just affecting a companyís profit. But that means, what theyíre doing, means that people are going to be able to stay on food stamps for another month or two, which is like really important.îAlso featured in the video is former Chief of Staff for the Center of Medicaid and Human Services, Jessica Schubel, who is currently Senior Policy Analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.† Project Veritas describes her as ìa conduit for leakers inside her former government department who are actively trying to obstruct administration policies.îIn the video, Schubel describes how she has a few friends still working within the government who give her ìinformation.î Including one particular friend who physically mailed her ìconfidentialî government information:JOURNALISTSo, your friend mailed you the policy that was about to come into effectÖ What policy was it?JESSICA SCHUBELUm, it was the policy that allows states to require Medicare beneficiaries to work in order to get coverage.JOURNALISTOkay. And then she mailed it to you in like physical snail mail like the post office and then you like got it. Thatís like awesome.JESSICA SCHUBELYeah. Itís kind of like the Nixon, ìdeep throatî type of thing.JOURNALISTYour friend mailed you information, even though she, technically, like, probably wasnít supposed to.JESSICA SCHUBELShe definitely wasnít supposed to.ìThis may be the largest case of unaccountability in our government that has ever been exposed,î said Project Veritas President James OíKeefe in a press release on Wednesday.† ìThese videos are the Deep State incarnate, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.î"
