I think weíre close to that. I think there are enough Republicans that are just fed up with it. Ö So, we need 60, 47, we need 13 of them. At a high-water mark, we had nine, before this last shutdown was lifted. I think itíll be hard as heck for the president to keep his ranks solid among Senate Republicans if he tries to go for another shutdown. So, Iíve got my fingers crossed that that will avoid that possibility. With votes in the Senate and in the House, we can fund the government, maybe even over his vetoÖif it reaches that point.îDurbin added that it is possible to find common ground on immigration, ìbut I donít know if we can find common ground with this president.î(h/t Grabien)Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter†@IanHanchett

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/25/senate-approves-short-term-spending-bill-by-voice-vote/,"The Senate approved a three-week short-term spending bill by voice vote on Friday, which would end the government shutdown if passed by the House and signed by President Donald Trump.The Senate passed a short-term spending bill on Friday afternoon after President Trump announced a deal with congressional leaders that would temporarily open the government and allow for Congress and the president to work out a potential compromise that would fund Trumpís proposed wall along Americaís southern border.The bill will now go to the House, where they will likely pass it sometime Friday and then send it to the presidentís desk to sign. This will end the longest government shutdown in American history.Sen. Marsha†Blackburn (R-TN), one the presidentís staunchest allies in the Senate, said while the spending bill will end the government shutdown, it will not end the crisis at Americaís southern border.Blackburn said:President Trump has reached a compromise with Democratic and Republican leaders to reopen the federal government with a short term continuing resolution. While this action solves the immediate problem of funding the back pay of 800,000 federal workers, it does not address the urgent need to end the humanitarian crisis on our southern border. It does not end the illegal flow of drugs, gangs and human traffickers. Congressí work on this issue is far from over. I will continue to support our border patrol and their three essential needs: a border barrier, additional technology and more officers and agents on the border. I also support ending the DACA program, chain migration and the visa lottery system.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC),†another strong ally of President Trump, said that now is the ìlast, best chanceî to fix Americaís broken borders and immigration system.Graham said, ìI hope Congress, in a bipartisan fashion, will work with the President and take advantage of this moment.îìThis is the last, best chance to take a major step toward fixing broken borders and a broken immigration system,î Graham added. ìThank you, Mr. President. †Letís make this a win-win for America!î

The deal he reached with congressional leaders contains no new money for the wall.

ìIn a short while, I will sign a bill to reopen our federal government for three weeks until Feb.15,î Trump said, confirming details first reported by the Drudge Report and subsequently confirmed by other media outlets.

Nobody should be working without pay,î he explained.†ìFederal workers, donít go to work without pay.†And we, the people, we shouldnít be supporting anything that requires someone whoís not paid working for us.îMoore also weighed in on speculation that Trump may declare a national emergency over the immigration crisis at the southern border, comparing it to the style of authoritarian leaders and warning that people would have to ìnon-violently rise upî against him if he chose to do so.ìListen, if he declares a national emergency, this man is out of control,î Moore argued. ìThis is our country. We are a democracy, weíre a free society. If this were any other country, if it were Turkey or the Philippines or Russia, and they had an election and the rulerís party somehow lost half their legislative branch like he did in November and then that ruler declared a month later, Iím shutting down the government, what would we call that if it were another country doing that?îìThis guy doesnít want the government to be open, he certainly doesnít want the Department of Justice to be openî Moore continued. ìSo if he tries to pull a national emergency, we the people have to declare a national emergency. We have to non-violently rise up. We have to take to the streets. We have to build our own wallóa human wallóaround the White House.îIt is not the first time that Moore has proposed acts of civil disobedience in protest of the government shutdown. Last month, the 64-year-old activist filmmaker also called for a ìmass uprisingî of federal workers that included sit-ins, the storming of buildings, and the harassment of lawmakers.ìWhat would a nonviolent mass uprising by 800,000 federal workers look like?

Read Breitbart News Networkís original report below.†The†Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday halted flights into New York Cityís LaGuardia airport amid air traffic control staffing shortages, according to reports.The development comes after airline officials warned the partial government shutdown is causing great strain the U.S. aviation system.Flight delays have been reported at several major East Coast airports, including Newark Liberty International, Philadelphia International, and Reagan National in Washington, D.C.The FAA told NBC News that the delays are caused by staffing issues at two air traffic control facilities impacting New York and Florida and said it is ìaugmenting staffing, rerouting traffic, and increasing spacing between aircraft as needed.îHowever, a spokesperson for the FAA said Thursday that the agency had seen ìno unusual increased absenteeism and there are no operational disruptions due to staffing.îIn a statement, the White House said President Trump has been briefed on the air travel issues and are ìmonitoring the ongoing delays at some airports. We are in regular contact with officials at the Dept. of Transportation and the FAA.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/24/exclusive-excerpts-from-team-of-vipers-john-kelly-overheard-undermining-president-trump-on-syria/,"Former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly was overheard in the West Wing in a conversation with former Deputy White House Chief of Staff Joe Hagin deliberately undermining President Donald Trumpís strategy on Syria, an excerpt from a forthcoming book from a former White House official provided exclusively to Breitbart News alleges.Former West Wing communications official Cliff Sims, the author of Team of Vipers: My Extraordinary 500 Days in the Trump White House, describes in the book how he heard Kelly in conversation with Hagin about how to stop Trump from withdrawing U.S. forces from Syriaña point of contention between Trump and Kelly.Sims describes the hallway between the Oval Office and the Vice Presidentís suite in the West Wing, setting the scene for what he heard Kelly saying about Trumpís policies:On the afternoon of Thursday, March 29, I was sitting in the back hall≠ way of the West Wing, outside Jaredís office, waiting to fill him in on my impending move to the NEC. The President was in Richfield, Ohio, announc≠ing plans to ìrebuild Americaís crumbling infrastructure,î so in his absence, the West Wing was uncharacteristically quiet. But since he was flying straight from Ohio to Mar≠-a≠-Lago for a long Easter weekend, most of the staff had stayed behind, including General Kelly and Deputy Chief of Staff Joe Hagin.The back hallway of the West Wing is a roughly twenty≠-five≠-yard straight shot from the Oval on one end to the Vice Presidentís suite on the other. Work≠ing your way down the hallway from the Oval, on the left side was the Pres≠identís private dining room, Jaredís office, then the Chiefís suite. On the right side were the Roosevelt Room; the scheduler, Michael Haidet; and Hagin. This was the most prime real estate in the entire building. In an environment where proximity to the President was power, this was the inner sanctum. The hallway was lined with the usual combination of historical paintings, an≠tique cabinetry, and famous busts and sculptures. The ceiling was slightly curved, like the top of the number zero. While the upper press office, where I worked, was the bustling center of activity, not to mention accessible to the media, this place was almost serene.About fifteen feet down the hallway from where I was sitting, I could hear†the TV inside the Chiefís suite airing coverage from Trumpís Ohio event, which was set to begin any minute. Hagin sauntered out of his office and across the hall, where he found Kelly standing in front of the TV with a couple of other close aides. Though I hadnít intended to, I overheard their entire, un≠ guarded conversation.At that point, Sims then describes the conversation he overheard between Kelly and Hagin, in which they criticized the presidentís style of rolling out major announcementsñand where Kelly said that Trump ìbetter notî announce a U.S. withdrawal from Syria:ìI talked to the President on the plane and he swore to me that he wouldnít announce anything about Syria,î Kelly said, in an exasperated tone. I knew immediately what he was talking about. The President had for some time been privately expressing a desire to pull U.S. troops out of Syria. I wasnít involved in the national security decision≠-making process, but his inclination to pull out was well known throughout the building. Top military officials were urg≠ing him to keep a couple of thousand troops in the country to clear out the last remnants of the so-called Islamic State. To that point he had begrudg≠ingly acquiesced, but his patience was running thin. Kelly clearly was expect≠ ing him to say something about the topic anyway.ìWe wonít know until he walks offstage,î Hagin replied with a resigned chuckle. This was a common sentiment among staffers who bristled at Trumpís tendency to go off script during his remarks. It also happened to be what made him interesting to watchóno one knew what he would say, not even the staff.ìHe dó well better know not to screw us on this,î Kelly growled. I was taken aback by this brief but revealing exchange, which seemed to encapsu≠late Kellyís view of his job and of the President himself: which was that Trump was a missile of chaos and Kelly was the general trying to keep him in the silo. Many reporters over the years reported that this was Kellyís view of the jobóto various denials from the White Houseóbut we all knew it was true.Later in the year and after the midterm elections, the president would announce the withdrawal from Syria despite opposition from Kelly and other military†officials.At the end of this excerpt, Sims describes the attitude of Kelly and others who viewed it as their mission to stop Trump from doing what he set out to do as president:In fact, there was a pervasive view among some of the Presidentís most senior aides that there was something patriotic about undermining Trumpís most disruptive impulses. I know that many people reading this will say, ìThank God.î And if I give them the benefit of the doubt, it may have been a sincere effort to do what they thought was in the best interest of the coun≠try. But whether they were sincere or not, I found it cowardly. Thereís noth≠ing patriotic about being a part of ìthe resistanceî inside the building. Imagine the arrogance of saying, ìI know sixty≠ three million of my fellow Ameri≠cans voted for this guy, but Iím going to sabotage him anyway because I know better.îThis is hardly the only excerpt regarding Kelly in Simsí explosive book, which has already seen stories come out about how Sims recounts the creation in a secret meeting with Trump of an enemies list of people Trump could not trust and a separate list of those he could trust. Sims, unlike many others who have left the White House and gone on to attack the president in books or public comments, remains loyal to Trump and is trying to out leakersñor sleeper cells, as they are calledñin the West Wing. One alleged leaker exposed in another excerpt in Simsí book is White House counselor KellyAnne Conway, who, Sims recounts in an excerpt published by Vanity Fair, asked him to write a statement on her computer saying she was not disloyal or leakingñwhile he watched messages appear on her screen between her and media figures in which she allegedly trashed the president, his family, and his administration.The other Kelly excerpt in Simsí forthcoming book recounts Kellyís first day as White House chief of staff, and a speech he gave to the entire staff of the White House, including the broader campus which includes hundreds of officials who do not work regularly in the West Wing.Sims recounts how he thought Kellyís speech started strong, and he thought he might actually become an ally of the presidentís agenda in the White House:Kelly assembled all of the staff working in the EEOB to deliver his introductory remarks. He stood at a podium at the intersection of two large hallways, black≠-and-≠white-≠checkered floors stretching the length of a city block. Several hundred staffers crowded around him. Some of us from the West Wing walked across the driveway as well, curious to hear what he would say.ìNice to meet you, Iím from Boston,î he said right off the bat. I smirked and nodded my head. We were from dramatically different places, but I was proud of where I came from, too. I felt like it said something about who I was. Kelly clearly felt the same way about his blue≠-collar roots. I liked that about him right away.Simsí positive impressions did not last long. He continues:But then things got a little weird.The primary theme of his speech was that he planned to approach his new job by serving the country, then the President, in that order, and that we should do the same. At first blush, this didnít seem like a particularly profound state≠ment, much less a controversial one. But the more he spoke, the more he seemed to really be hammering on this construct: country, then President, country, then President. And the more I let it soak in, the more I thought that what Kelly was sayingócountry first, POTUS secondówas, at best, a bit curious, and at worst, potentially hostile.We believed that the way we served our country was by serving the Pres≠ident. Kelly, on the other hand, seemed to be intimating that those two goals might be at odds, perhaps even mutually exclusive at times. And you know what? Maybe they would be. But if they ever were, the honorable response would be to resign. Maybe we were being paranoid after being in the Trump bunker for so long, but Kelly seemed to be saying that, in such a scenario, it might be necessary to subvert the Presidentís wishes in service of some amor≠phous higher calling.Most of us had met his arrival with optimism after enduring six months of staff upheaval. Now I was watching some of the Presidentís most ardent supporters shuffling back to their offices, hanging their heads in concern.ìWhat a letdown,î one of them said. ìHe comes across like he doesnít even like the President, much less want to work for him.îI am still not certain what motivated Kelly to use his first interaction with the majority of the White House staff to say what he didÖ But right off the bat his remarks hurt his stand≠ing among loyal aides who were hoping he could unify the fractious staff behind a singular mission: advancing the Presidentís agenda.This week,†Kelly signed onto a letter with other anti-Trump forces pushing the President to end the shutdown without a border wall. This is powerful evidence supporting Simsí claims Kelly had wanted to subvert the Presidentís agenda.Kelly, who served as Secretary of Homeland Security before taking the chief of staff position in the White House, signed a letter with other former Secretaries of Homeland Security calling on Trump to cave on the government shutdown and reopen the government without a border wall.JUST IN: 5 former DHS secretaries, including former Trump Chief of Staff John Kelly, call for President Trump and Congress to ""fund the critical mission of DHS,"" according to letter obtained by @NBCNews ñ @jesserodriguez https://t.co/whd8qQSFCW pic.twitter.com/UBwYqYPQYTó NBC News (@NBCNews) January 24, 2019In addition to Kelly, the letter was signed by former George W. Bush DHS Secretaries Michael Chertoff and Tom Ridge, as well as Barack Obama DHS secretaries Janet Napolitano and Jeh Johnson.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/24/donald-trump-demands-wall-funding-in-any-short-term-compromise-to-re-open-government/,"President Donald Trump said Thursday that he would consider a short-term funding bill to reopen the government, but only if he could get funding for border barriers.Trump commented on the news after the Senate failed Thursday afternoon to pass a measure to reopen the government. Both the Republican proposal and the Democrat proposal failed to meet the 60 vote threshold needed to move forward.ìYou need 60 Ö We knew they both were not going to go anywhere, we thought, and now Mitch is negotiating with Chuck Schumer and weíll see what happens,î Trump told reporters at the White House.Trump noted that both Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were discussing†a possible short-term deal to reopen the government while talks continued.White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also issued a statement about Trumpís position on a short-term funding bill.ìAs was made clear to Senator Lindsey Graham, the three week CR would only work if there is a large down payment on the wall,î Sanders said.But the president also spoke about alternative ways to fund the wall, reasserting its importance in stopping human trafficking, illegal drugs, and illegal immigration.ìWe have to have a wall in this situation,î he said.The president spoke about the ongoing government shutdown during a meeting at the White House with members of Congress on trade.He thanked furloughed federal government workers as well as those working without pay.ìI love them, I respect them, I really appreciate the great job theyíre doing,î he said. ìMany of those people that are not getting paid are totally in favor of what weíre doing.îTrump said that he supported technology like sensors and drones, but only with a physical barrier.ìAny technology only works with a wall,î Trump said.

A Republican one would give President Trump money for the wall while one from Democrats would re-open government through February 8, with no wall money, giving bargainers time to talk about it.Both proposals were likely to fail to reach the 60-vote threshold needed in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. As well, House Democrats are putting forward a new proposal, aiming to lure the president away from his demand for a border wall by offering billions of new dollars for other border security measures.The Associated Press contributed to this report.†

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) on Saturday lauded President Donald Trumpís compromise proposal to end the partial government shutdown and expressed enthusiasm about turning the plan into law.President Trump offered Democrat leaders a three-year extension on the temporary legal status of 700,000 ìDreamersî†ó immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally by their parents†ó plus a three-year extension of the temporary protected status (TPS) for 300,000 immigrants whose status faces expiration.The president floated $805 million in port and border screening security and†$800 million worth of humanitarian aid. Further, he†vowed to hire 2000 additional border agents and†75†more immigration†judge teama to handle the backlog of border cases.The president declared in his highly-anticipated announcement from the White Houseís Diplomatic room that ìboth sides in Washington must simply come togetherî in an effort to ìbreak the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward to end the government shutdown and solve the crisis on the southern border.îShortly after President Trumpís remarks, Graham signaled he was ready to do just that, tweeting: ìA fantastic proposal Mr. President! Letís get it done!îA fantastic proposal Mr.  President! Let's get it done! https://t.co/m8bzYGRLTwó Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) January 19, 2019Last month, Graham urged the White House and Democrats to back what he described as a ìbreakthroughî compromise to re-open the government, now in its 29th day of partial shutdown ñ the longest in U.S. history ñ which would trade protections of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients for $5 billion in wall funding.Following a two-hour lunch at the White House, the South Carolina Republican signaled the president was open to supporting the proposal, which would entail backing the Bridge Act†ó a bill championed by Graham that would give DACA holders three-year extensions on their work permits. The proposed legislation would also give TPS recipients an extension on their status.ìI think thatís in the realm of possibility. The president didnít commit, but I think heís very open-minded. I know thereís some Democrats out there who would be willing to provide money for a wall, border security, if we could deal with the DACA population and TPS people,î Graham told reporters at the time.ìI donít see Democrats giving us more money, unless they get something,î he added.Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), an ally of the president, signaled her support for Saturdayís proposal in a statement, calling on Congress to agree on a compromise to re-open the government.†ìThe president has once again shown he is willing to work with Democrats to end this shutdown and find a compromise that will secure our border,î Blackburn said. ìThis proposal that has bipartisan support would provide the much-needed $5.7 billion for a border barrier.îìThe border patrol agents have repeatedly asked for three items: a physical barrier, more technology, and more agents and officers. As members of Congress, we must deliver for them,î she added.However, almost immediately after the presidentís offer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Chuck Schumer (D-NY) balked at the deal, adding to a list of compromises the Democrats have shot down from the White House.Pelosi said in a statement:Democrats were hopeful that the President was finally willing be to re-open government and proceed with a much-need discussion to protect the border. Unfortunately, initial reports make clear that his proposal is a compilation of several previously rejected initiatives, each of which is unacceptable and in total, do not represent a good faith effort to restore certainty to peopleís lives,î she said in a statement. Ö It is unlikely that any one of these provisions alone would pass the House, and taken together, they are a non-starter.In a separate statement, Schumer described the presidentís offer to an ongoing hostage situation.†ìThereís only way out: open up the government, Mr. President, and then Democrats and Republicans can have a civil discussion and come up with bipartisan solutions,î he said. ì[O]ffering some protections back in exchange for the wall is not a compromise but more hostage taking.î

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/01/19/klobuchar-trump-should-come-back-to-the-table-end-shutdown/,"During Fridayís Democratic Weekly Address, Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) asked President Trump ìto come back to the table,î and end the government shutdown.Transcript as Follows:ìIím Amy Klobuchar, the Senator from the state of Minnesota.This weekend, we are on the verge of what soon will be a month-long government shutdown, and itís the longest and most senseless shutdown in American history. Thatís nearly a month of hundreds of thousands of workers not getting paid. Thatís nearly a month of everything from air safety to medical advancement being undermined. Nearly a month of unnecessary anxiety and unwarranted chaos.This past week, the President declared heíll ënever back downí from his decision to shut down the government until he gets what he wants.We ask the President to come back to the table, and to stop holding the hard-working people of America hostage by requiring them to pay ransom to reopen their government. Especially after we already passed bills to reopen the government and to help secure our borders.We ask the President to end this shutdown.We ask him to listen to his own employees. Like Kathleen, from my home state, a newly hired employee at the Department of Agriculture who was so excited about her new job, but now she is no longer getting paid. She wrote a letter to me:ëMy funds are exhausted,í she says, ëAt this point in time, I donít have the money to pay for my mortgage or for childcare for my daughter.íShe goes on to ask the question no parent should have to ask: ëDo I risk losing my home or do I risk having my daughter lose her daycare and then be unable to go to work when Iím recalled?íShe finishes by saying, ëThis may be a story you have heard before, but I felt it needs to be shared until it is heard by the right ears.íKathleen, today a whole lot of people are hearing your story.Thanks to our workers and businessesówe have reached a moment in our country where we should be governing from opportunity, and not chaos. We should be working together to pass major legislation to bring down prescription drug prices and health care costs for Americans, to make it easier to afford college and child care, to create incentives for clean green energy, to pass immigration reform, to train workers for the jobs we have today and could have tomorrow.But what is happening instead? The Presidentís own economic adviser has estimated that this shutdown will cost the American economy billions of dollars every week. Thatís billions of dollars.With this shutdown the administration is not creating opportunity, it is fomenting chaos. Instead of lifting the economic burden of health care and family expenses off the shoulders of our citizens, the administration has chosen to place the costs of its chaos firmly on the backs of the hard-working people of America: forcing them into lines in airports, reducing help for our farmers and rural areas, closing the gates to our parks and the doors to our small businesses.As one furloughed FDA employee told a newspaper after visiting a food shelf for the first time just to feed herself and her five children: ëPresident Trumpís talking about a crisis on the border, but we have a crisis right here.íI ask the President and my Republican colleagues to listen to those words, the words of an ordinary American, who like so many others, does extraordinary work for us every day. These are people working on the front lines without pay to keep us safe from terror, guard our coasts, investigate and prosecute those that do us harm, and keep our food safe and our life-saving cures moving forward.I ask my fellow citizens to make their views clear and to tell this President and my Republican colleagues to stop the self-inflicted manufactured crisis and enact one of the many bills Congress has passed on a bipartisan basis to end this shutdown. I ask Leader McConnell to take up the House-passed bills in the Senate and send them to the Presidentís desk.Why? Because in this week of Martin Luther Kingís birthday, we remember the words of Dr. King: ëthe time is always right to do what is right.íNow is the time to do what is right Mr. President. End this shutdown and put hard-working Americans back to work.îFollow Ian†Hanchett on Twitter†@IanHanchett

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/18/poll-trumps-support-among-hispanics-soars-amid-fight-for-border-wall/,"President Trumpís support among Hispanic American voters has soared as he is refusing to buckle to pressure from Republicans and Democrats to reopen the federal government without funding†for his proposed wall along the United States-Mexico border.In the latest NPR/Marist/PBS Poll, about 50 percent of Hispanic American voters this month said they approve of the job Trump is doing in the middle of the government shutdown. This is a 19 percentage point increase from last month, when only about 31 percent of Hispanic voters said they approved of Trump.The poll revealed that since the start of the shutdown, Trumpís approval has barely changed among nearly all demographic†groups. For example, Trumpís approval ó since doubling down on obtaining border wall funding ó with swing voters has hardly moved, with about 37 to 38 percent approving of the job he is doing between December 2018 and January 2019.The data does suggest Trump could be losing ground with white American voters for the administrationís lack of progress on the issue of immigration. Last month, about 50 percent of white voters said they approved of Trump. This month, only about 40 percent of white voters said they approved.In the meantime, support for Trumpís proposed border wall has skyrocketed in popularity with swing voters, as Breitbart News reported.This time last year, an†ABC News/Washington Post†poll†found that†only 34 percent of voters supported a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.†Today, support for the wall has climbed to 42 percent overall. Most notable, about 40 percent of swing voters now say they support a border wall. This is a ten percentage point increase in support for the wall among swing voters since last year.Currently, the federal government has remained partially shut down as House Democrats block any funding for physical barriers at the U.S.-Mexico border. A handful of Senate Republicans crafted a plan to give amnesty to illegal aliens that ultimately†failed†to gain traction.Border crossings in November 2018 ó the last month from which data is available ó hit†close to†52,000, marking the highest level of illegal immigration in the month of November since 2006. Projections indicate that illegal immigration for next year will reach 600,000 border crossings, the highest level of illegal immigration in more than a†decade. Meanwhile,†drug overdoses in 2017†killed an unprecedented†72,287 U.S. residents, nearly three times the number of individuals killed by global terrorism. Nearly 50,000 of those deadly overdoses were caused by either heroin or fentanyl.John Binder is a reporter†for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at†@JxhnBinder.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/18/nancy-pelosi-claims-democrats-planned-to-fly-commercial-from-an-air-force-base/,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Friday canceled a visit to Afghanistan, accusing the White House of leaking commercial travel plans to the war zone after President Donald Trump denied her and other Democrats access to a military aircraft for a seven-day foreign trip.ìWe werenít going to go because we had a report from Afghanistan†that the president outing out trip had made feet on the ground much more dangerous because itís a signal to bad actors that we were coming,î Pelosi told reporters on Friday.†ìThe fact that they would leak that we were flying commercial is a danger not only to us but to other people.It is ìvery irresponsible on the part of the president,î Pelosi said of the purported leak.†She would not answer how she learned that the White House had leaked the information.
In a statement, the White House denied leaking the speakerís flight plans, calling the accusation ìa flat out lie.îìWhen the Speaker of the house and about 20 others from Capitol Hill decide to book their own commercial flights to Afghanistan, the world is going to find out. The idea we would leak anything that would put the safety and security of any American at risk is a flat out lie,î said the White House.In a Thursday letter to Pelosi, President Trump notified the speaker that he was revoking access to the plane for her trip to Egypt, Brussels, and Afghanistan, writing: ìIn light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, Iím sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate.îìI also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown,î he continued. President Trump said Pelosi†was welcome to fly on a commercial plane to make the visit.†ìObviously, if you would like to make your journey by flying commercial, that would certainly be your prerogative,î he wrote.Democrats were scheduled to depart around 3:00 p.m. EST for their overseas trip, according to the White House. Shortly after access to military jet was revoked, Hamill said Democrats planned to meet with NATO leaders in Brussels to ìobtain critical national security & intelligence briefings from those on the front lines.îSpeaking to the media after jet access was revoked,†Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) accused President Trump of breaking the law by revealing Pelosi visit to Afganistan, citing potential security concerns.†ìI donít understand if Mr. Trump understands the laws and procedures in our country,î Warner told†CBS when asked about the cancelation. ìI donít know what Speaker Pelosi is doing, not doing. Sometimes members take trips into dangerous areas, and only announced after the fact.îìIf someone had revealed about the presidentís trip beforehand, around Christmas when he went to the war zone ó if someone had revealed that beforehand, that would have been a violation of law, policy, and procedure,î he continued. ìI donít know why what the president may have done today isnít that same kind of violation.îThe tripís cancellation comes as President Trump and Democrat leaders remain locked in a bitter fight over a bill which would fund a U.S.-Mexico border wall to the tune of $5.7 billion White House officials met with rank-and-file Democrats on Wednesday in an†effort†to carve out a deal with centrist lawmakers from states where the president enjoys high levels of support. During a conference call with supporters this week, President Trump showed no signs of backing down on his chief campaign promise, reiterating his pledge to build a wall.ìWeíre going to stay out for a long time, if we have to,î he†said of the shutdown.†ìWeíll be out for a long time.îEditorís Note: This article has been updated to clarify that Pelosiís office claimed the White House leaked new, overnight plans to travel commercially to Afghanistan†ó not that the trip referenced in President Trumpís Thursday letter had been planned as a commercial flight.

But regardless of what the presidentís motivation is for this, the one thing here isówe will not let the president of the United States tell the Congress you canít do your oversight. That appears whatís going on here. And we are a coequal branch of government. It may not have been that way over the last two years when he had a Republican Congress willing to roll over any time he asked, but that is no longer the case.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2019/01/17/mark-green-gop-is-lockstep-on-border-wall-were-not-giving-in/,"Rep. Mark Green (R-TN) told Breitbart News on Wednesday that House Republicans are in ìlockstepî and ìall togetherî on the issue of border security amidst an ongoing partial federal government shutdown, offering his remarks in an interview on SiriusXMís Breitbart News Tonight with hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.Green said, ìThe Republican Caucus, usually we tend to not stick together. As you know, the Democrats seem to be able to stick together better than we do, and theyíve done that in the past. This time, weíre lockstep. We know this issue is critical. Itís worth putting a stake in the ground and saying, ëWeíre not giving in.í The American people want border security. This president has sort of said, ëHow about 234 miles?í and ëHow about 2,000 more law enforcement officers?í and ëHow about 750 more border patrol agents?'îLISTEN:Green continued, ì[Donald Trump] has made, I think, a great effort to use 21st century technology on the part of border security, and [Democrats] are just ignoring it. They donít want to negotiate. They have no interest in it. Weíre lockstep. Weíre all together, and weíre not giving in.îGreen added, ì[Democrats] came to us today with, ëWhat if we just opened it for 14 days or for 21 days?í Any promises they make at this point have no merit.îPollak responded, ìRight. You say, ëLetís open it, again,í and at the end of 14 days ó if they donít want to come to an agreement ó youíre in the same position youíre in now, and youíve lost the support of your own side.îGreen replied, ìYes. Thatís right.îMansour segued to the issue of health care.ìThis whole standoff is not what the American people want to happen,î said Mansour. ìWe didnít vote for this gamesmanship going on. We want a wall. We voted for a wall. We also voted for movement on things like health care.îMansour highlighted Greenís professional background as a physician and military veteran. Green served two tours in Afghanistan and a tour in Iraq as a member of the U.S. Armyís 82nd Airborne Division.Mansour said, ìAs a member of the Tennessee State Senate, you had worked on the healthcare issue trying to find innovative ways to get some solutions concerning health care. This is needed now more than ever, because right now ó according to the latest Gallup poll that come out on Monday ó we learned that 70 percent of Americans ó seven in 10 Americans ó believe that our current healthcare system has major problems or is in a state of crisis.îMansour asked, ìOverwhelmingly, the American public feels that our healthcare system is falling apart. Drug prices are rising. The Democrats ran on this issue [and] said they were going to have some solutions. Are we getting any action on this?îGreen explained how both healthcare consumers and providers are often ignorant of pricing given the status quo of the healthcare system.Green explained, ìThe real issue in healthcare is the incentives are backwards. We have not incentivized people to save or shop for price. Itís gotten so bad that if you go to your doctor and ask, ëHow much is this knee replacement?í the physician probably doesnít even know, and there may be five different prices because with each payer ó with each insurance company ó thereís a different price, because theyíve independently negotiated with each of those.îGreen added, ìIt also explains why inflation in health care has grown at twice the rate of the rest of the economy for thirty-plus years. What weíve got to do is incentivize people to shop and save, and health savings accounts did that. You have a system where patients are paying first dollar out of their own pocket, they consume significantly less healthcare. We have got to get people shopping for healthcare again. Obviously there are people out there we need to help. We give Medicaid and we have Medicare which people pay into. Letís take a Medicaid patient; we are helping them and [providing] them with resources for healthcare. We need to find a way to incentivize them to save and to shop for price.îGreen proposed, ìMy idea was a swipe card similar to the EBT card. Ö What you donít spend of this [card], youíre going to get it back at the end of the year as a part of your earned income credit. Now the patient is motivated to shop, save, and only spend when they need to. It will also allow the free market back into health care. Right now, thereís no free market in health care. Some people would suggest a free market canít work in health care, but it can. Look at laser eye surgery. When it came out, it was $6,000 an eye. While the technology has gone up, the price has fallen to almost like ó I saw it the other day ó $300 an eye, and the ophthalmologists are doing just fine. When we let the market set the price itís significantly lower. Ö Weíve got to get people spending first dollar out of their own pocket and shopping for price. The true problem in health care is we have patients improperly incentivized.îBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.Follow Robert Kraychik on†Twitter.

On the shutdownís 25th day, President Trump did not move off his demand to have Congress provide $5.7 billion to build his promised border wall with Mexico. Democrats say they will discuss border security once the government has reopened, but Pelosi is refusing money for the wall they view as ineffective and immoral.The White House invited rank-and-file lawmakers to lunch with Trump at the White House as part of a strategy to build support from centrist Democrats and newly elected freshmen, including those from areas where the president is popular with voters.The president, on a conference call with supporters, showed no signs of backing down.ìWeíre going to stay out for a long time, if we have to,î Trump said. ìWeíll be out for a long time.îA short time later, a group of House Democrats made its way to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellís office demanding that he consider House-passed bills to fund the government. McConnell was not in his office at the time, so the Democrats left a note.McConnell says he doesnít want to waste the Senateís time and will only bring up measures that Trump will sign into law. Democrats, he said, have turned Trumpís wall into ìsomething evilî and itís time to get the country off the ìpolitical carouselî of the shutdown fight.The Associated Press contributed to this report.†

So, itís not officially off, no.BAIER: So, the Homeland Security Secretary tweeted out the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Secret Service are fully prepared to support and secure the State of the Union. We thank the service for their mission, focus, and dedication and for all they do each day and secure our homeland. They suggest thereís not an issue here.REP. HOYER: Well, Iíve heard that and weíll see what the president has to say. But, obviously, the speaker is absolutely correct. This is a very high-security event, as you well know.†You have all the Supreme Court, you have all the Cabinet, you have the vice president and the president, and the Speaker of the House and the majority leader and minority leaders of the United States Senate. So, itís a very high-security issue.†But, the other thing from my perspective, Bret, is we ought not to be doing business as usual with a government shutdown that has 800,000 of its people not getting paid, including everyone one of secret service agents that there would be assigned.Now, itís tough to believe that theyíre on highest security alert when theyíre concerned about whether theyíre going to get a paycheck and be able to pay their mortgage. So, from that standpoint, I think the speakerís point was well taken and our position has been we ought to open up this government and then proceed with the business of government while itís operating, not while its shutdown.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/radio/2019/01/16/markwayne-mullin-democrats-refuse-to-fund-health-services-for-native-americans/,"Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) told Breitbart News that House Democrats blocked his proposed legislation to fund Indian Health Services (IHS), whose annual funding is in jeopardy due ongoing partial federal government shutdown.In a Tuesday interview on SiriusXMís Breitbart News Tonight with host Rebecca Mansour, Mullin explained that Democrats on the House Rules Committee blocked his amendment, called the Pay Our Doctors Act, which would fund health services for Native Americans through the fiscal year. Democrats voted it down on an 8 to 4 party line vote.Mullin explained, ìIn our district, we have a very high Native American population. In fact, I represent more tribes than any other district in the country. I have 19 separate tribes, which is 19 separate governments, essentially, in my district alone.îLISTEN:Mullin continued, ìCaught up in this fight is the Indian Health Services, because itís part of the Interior, and the Interior is shut down, so the Bureau of Indian Affairs is underneath the Interior, and on the other side is the Indian Health Services. The tribes throughout my district is by far the largest employer in my 26 counties I represent.îAs the statement on Mullinís congressional website noted, his amendment would ìensure that both tribally-run hospitals and Urban Indian Clinics receive the funding they need to pay their doctors and keep their doors open.î The statement explains:During a government shutdown, tribally-run hospitals and Urban Indian Clinics do not receive annual funding, which is typically distributed in a lump sum at the beginning of a fiscal year. Hospitals and clinics are forced to make ends meet by using any remaining rollover funds from the previous year.† If no funds are available, hospitals and clinics are forced to furlough or lay-off staff.Mullin described the importance of the federal governmentís treaty obligations to our sovereign Native Americans tribes.ìThe issue we have right now is that even though itís a federal obligation because Indian Health Services came out of treaties that were signed with tribes, we essentially removed them from their traditional land.î said Mullin. ì[We] said, ëIf you move to this part of the country, mainly Oklahoma, weíre going to take care of X, Y, and Z for youí as part of a treaty.îMullin went on, ìSomehow that got caught up in this political crossfire, and in my opinion the federal government isnít living up to their end of the bargain which is in breach of a trust, or the treaties to which it signed decades ago.îMansour noted Mullinís belonging to the Cherokee Nation. ìYou are also a member of the Cherokee Nation, so this is close to home for you in many ways,î she said. ìThese are sovereign nations, sovereign tribes. We have a duty to them.ìMullin replied, ìI really appreciate you doing your homework on that, understanding that theyíre sovereign nations, and itís based on treaties. Youíd be surprised how many ó even among my colleagues ó donít understand that.îMullin added, ìBorder security is vitally important. Thereís no question that weíre locked in on this fight, and we have the same win to fight for, so losingís not an option here. Weíre all in on securing our border. What Iím trying to do here is expose the federal obligation. The IRS is an agency that was created by Congress. The EPA and Interior were services that were outside of the original Constitution or federal obligations we have as a nation. The responsibility we have to Indian Country is a true federal obligation. it is no different than us having to pay our national debt or the interest on it, because it is a treaty we have signed with these tribes. So this is outside of just shutting down the government, this is still a federal obligation, regardless.îMullin stated, ìSo what weíve been trying to do is make that argument to our colleagues on both sides, and so we put an amendment today in front of Rules; the Pay Our Doctors Act, and it was to make sure that during this government shutdown that the federal government doesnít fail on their true responsibilities that we have to Indian Country.îMullin recalled how House Democrats shut down his funding proposals for funding of Indian Health Services.ìUnfortunately, I made the arguments, and then they didnít let me stay in to receive questions,î stated Mullin. ìIn fact, the only questions came from the Republican side of the Rules Committee. Democrats never asked me a single question, and then they voted it down straight on party lines. I was extremely disappointed in that. Iím all about securing our border, but we also have to make sure we pay attention to the obligation that we have, because I feel like the federal government is going to actually get sued if this continues to go down this road, because we are in breach of the trust that we have with Indian Country, and weíre trying to cut that off.îMullin implored, ìWe consider this payment. We were promised something to give up all of our land, so this is considered still paying off a debt that they had because we gave up a whole lot of land that we really, really, really liked that we had been on for generations prior to this ó which is called our traditional land ó and we were moved, and they said they would take care of this for the rest of infinity, because there was no end to the treaty. So this is still considered payment for the land that they stole ó truly stole ó from Indian Country.îMansour asked what advice Mullin would offer President Donald Trump in pursuit of a deal with Democrats to fund southern border wall proposals.ìDemocrats are running scared of Nancy Pelosi,î assessed Mullin. ìRight now, theyíre all getting their committee assignments. Committee assignment are vitally important up here. None of them want to feel like theyíre working with the president, at this point, because Speaker Pelosi isnít working with the president. So the freshman members, they donít want to look like theyíre pushing against leadership by going up there and trying to negotiate something with the president. Theyíre afraid that Speaker Pelosi will retaliate and not give them a committee assignment, at all, much less one of their choices. Behind the doors, thatís whatís going on.îMullin described Democrats as recalcitrant in opposition to Trumpís overtures for negotiation.ìThe president has done everything that he can,î said Mullin. ìHeís offered to make deals. There was an offer on the deal before Christmas which was for funding the border wall. We would in return offer DACA [and] TPS, which is a program set up under the Clinton and Bush administrations, and anyone that served in the military with an honorable discharge or is currently serving with honorable service, that we would give them legal status; not citizenship, but legal status. In return, though we wanted funding for the wall. We felt like we were making a fair offer. I know the White House is feeling like they were making a fair offer, and it went nowhere. Itís not even like we were negotiating. It was, ëNo, weíre not giving you a penny for the wall.'îMullin concluded, ìAt that point I donít know what the president does. The president is obligated as commander-in-chief to make sure heís doing all he can to protect the American people, and we have a huge national security risk on the southern border. Weíve known this for a long time. This is why in 2006 Chuck Schumer, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and even Joe Biden voted for the Secure Fence Act, which was to build no less than 700 miles of fence. If you look at the math of that, that was funded at $52 billion, which is about $74 million a mile, and they voted for it in 2006. Now, the only reason why theyíre not doing it with President Trump is because of political reasons. Thatís it, no other reason. So thereís no room to negotiate when people are making political decisions, and not rational decisions.îBreitbart News Tonight broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot channel 125 weeknights from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern or 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific.Follow Robert Kraychik on†Twitter.

They have to at least sit-down,†willing to have a conversation. So far they have been unwilling†to do anything. The presidentís proposal has†actual things that Democrats†specifically asked for. They asked for more technology†at ports of entry. They asked for a processing†center, asylum processing center†for people from Central America.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/15/accidental-opioid-deaths-top-car-accident-deaths-for-the-first-time/,"Deaths from accidental opioid overdoses now top car accidents for the first time, according to a report from the National Safety Council.ìData, collected in 2017, shows Americans have a one in 96 chance of dying from an opioid overdose. The probability of dying in a motor vehicle crash is one in 103,î reports Fox News.ìOpioid pain relievers are the most fatally abused drugs and theyíre entirely legal. Roughly 60 people die every day as a result of overdoses from opioids ñ thatís 22,630 Americans,î Fox adds. ìTo put that in perspective, thatís roughly the size of the entire population of Auburn Hills.îDeath from opioid overdose still donít come close to deaths by natural causes: heart disease (1 in 6), cancer (1 in 7), respiratory disease (1 in 27), or even suicide (1 in 88). But the far-left New York Times reports that while deaths from natural causes are decreasing, ìdeaths from preventable causes have ticked up, and the result is that Americansí life expectancy has actually decreased over the past few years.îThe primary cause of this increase, according to the Times, is not pills like Oxycontin, but fentanyl, which is generally administered through a patch or intravenously.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump made opioid death and addiction a cornerstone of his campaign. He was well ahead of both the media, his own Republican Party, and his opponent, Hillary Clinton, when it came to this issue.Currently, the president is fighting to keep fentanyl out of America with additional border security, something Democrats and their media allies are fighting bitterly against, up to and including a partial shutdown of the government, which is now in its third week.Earlier this week, Breitbart News reported on the amount of fentanyl stopped at the border last year.ìThe†Immigration and Customs Enforcementís (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit revealed in a year-end†report†that in total, about 2,737 pounds of fentanyl were†seized in Fiscal Year 2018.îìThe nearly 3,000 pounds of fentanyl is enough to kill about 600 million individuals, nearly twice the population of the U.S. where†about 330 million residents live.îAccording to National Safety Councilís grim death statistics, whatever is being stopped along our porous border is nowhere near enough. The problem is getting worse as Democrats party in Puerto Rico.†Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.†

Do you agree with him that there is a crisis at the border?CASTRO: What I believe is that heís created a tragedy at the border. This policy of separating children from their parents and the terrible way that Customs and Border Protection has managed its responsibilities, including the deaths of two children within the last few weeks. Thatís a real tragedy. And, you know, the folks down on the border know ñ and many of them have said ñ in fact, I just saw one border resident the other day on camera that said that a wall is not the answer. That we can have strong border security with personnel, with technology, but that the wall is not the answer. So the president may have his rhetoric, but everybody else has the facts right that a wall isnít the answer.MARGARET BRENNAN: Well that family separation policy has been paused at least. But there are a record number of family units crossing the border, and that creates a lot of challenges. So what would you do? Would you extend the amount of time that families can be held together in detention?CASTRO: I donít believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that weíre able to keep track of them in the country. And we have developed some ways to do that but that we donít detain them the way that we have been. So no, I donít agree with that. The other thing Iíll say Margaret, and this is very important is, I hope that folks remember that the president said that he wanted to do this family separation policy because it would deter more families coming from these countries. And actually, the exact opposite happened. And so heís failed. Heís a failed leader on this issue, and now heís just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time. And itís just a failure of leadership all around. I would end this kind of family detention. I would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology, and that does not scapegoat these immigrants but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system.MARGARET BRENNAN: Youíve been calling immigration system broken for some time, and you were critical even under the Obama administration, specifically about their high level of deportations. So what do you offer as an alternative if youíre not going to detain and youíre not going to deport what do you do with illegal immigrants?CASTRO: Well, what I believe we could do and what the Obama administration did do I believe toward the end of its tenure was to look at things like ankle monitors so that youíre able to monitor where people are in the country and ensure that they report back when they need to and that they are part of, you know, legal proceedings. But we also need to be serious about recognizing the right of people to seek asylum. And the president is playing games with this, blocking peopleís right to seek asylum. I would change that. I would make sure that we push as hard as possible for comprehensive immigration reform so that for the people who are already here, if theyíve been law-abiding, if they pay a fine, that- that they can get an earned path to citizenship. I still believe that that should be part of the answer.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

So did Ms. Pelosi.îDavi went on to note that Schumer and then-Senators Barack Obama (D-IL) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY) supported The Secure Fence Act in 2006, which funded a 700-mile long border fence for $50 billion over 25 years.President Trump has repeatedly stated he is weighing whether to declare a national emergency to end the shutdown, allowing the government to build the wall without congressional approval. However, on Friday, he signaled that the move may not come so swiftly.†ìThe easy solution is for me to call a national emergency. I could do that very quickly,î the president said at a White House event on border security. ìI have the absolute right to do it. But Iím not going to do it so fast. Because this is something Congress should do.îOn Wednesday, President Trump invited Pelosi and Schumer to the White House and kicked off the high-stakes sit down with a question: Will you support a wall in exchange for reopening the government?After Democrat leaders refused to support the idea, the president walked out of the meeting.Shortly after the failed tete-a-tete, the president tweeted that it had been a ìtotal waste of time,î revealing that he told Pelosi and Schumer ì bye-bye,î because ìnothing else works.îSpeaking to reporters outside the White House, Schumer claimed a frustrated President Trump ìsort of slammed the table,î then stormed out of the room.†ìAgain, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldnít get his way,î the Senate Minority Leader said.On Saturday morning, President Trump chided Democrats for traveling to Puerto Rico, calling on them to cut a deal to end the ìmassiveî humanitarian†crisis at the border.We have a massive Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. We will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their ìvacationsî and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign!ó Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2019

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/01/12/dem-rep-scott-peters-theres-a-humanitarian-crisis-at-the-border-created-by-trump/,"During Fridayís Democratic Weekly Address, Representative Scott Peters (D-CA) stated that President Trump has created a ìhumanitarian crisisî at the border and that the wall ìis never going to get built.îTranscript as Follows:ìHi, Iím Scott Peters and I represent San Diego, California in the United States Congress.When I first came to Congress in 2013, I asked the president of the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce in San Diego ñ who also happens to be the cityís Republican former Mayor and Police Chief ñ whatís the number one thing the federal government could do to promote job growth in our region. He said we needed to make a federal investment in critical infrastructure at our border with Mexico.But this former Police Chief wasnít asking for a wall.He was asking for a gateway ñ a bridge, and improved customs facilities at the San Ysidro Port of Entry because long delays at the vehicle crossing were costing our region billions of dollars in economic activity and 60,000 jobs per year.Working together, San Diegoís Congressional delegation, Republicans and Democrats, secured the additional $442-million in federal investment to modernize the San Ysidro Port of Entry. It is the busiest land border crossing in the Western Hemisphere, where commercial trade between San Diego and Tijuana is valued at $2.1 million per day.Our nationís investments in Ports of Entry support a thriving international economy. They also provide critical border security. Customs agents inspect, weigh and x-ray vehicles and bags. They make sure travelers have proper identification and valid visas ñ that they are properly vetted and screened before entering the United States.215,000 tons of hard drugs were intercepted at ports of entry from 2012 to 2016. Agents at our ports everyday arrest criminals, seize narcotics and guns and deny admission to people they identify as a threat to national security.Thatís what real border security looks like, and I can tell you that San Diegans want that border security. But we do not want a wall.In the last Congress, my colleagues Pete Aguilar of California, a Democrat, and Will Hurd of Texas, a Republican, proposed legislation with wide bipartisan support that included border security measures we could all agree on.It would have directed Homeland Security to perform a mile-by-mile assessment of our entire southern border to determine the most practical and effective way to secure it, and to offer Congress a strategy for each section of the border.It might be state-of-the-art technologies to detect tunnels, because even in places where we have a fence, as we do in San Diego, itís easy to dig tunnels underneath.It might be sensors and radar to spot moving people and objects in any weather or time of day.It might be cameras mounted on drones to surveil places where the terrain is tough to monitor.Or, it might be, a physical barrier, such as a levee or fence if that makes sense in some places. But if Homeland Security wanted to recommend something as expensive as a wall in a particular place, theyíd have to justify the extra expense against other less costly tools.In the last Congress, 193 Congressional Democrats and 23 Republicans acted to force a vote on these smart approaches to border security. But unfortunately, Republican leadership did not allow a vote on our bipartisan bill, but I bet most Democrats would support these measures in this Congress this year.So, when President Trump says Democrats are against border security and for open borders, heís lying.We do not support a multi-billion dollar wall that will destroy sensitive lands, take private property, and can be tunneled under, climbed over or cut through, all while illegal border crossings have steadily declined over the past two decades. No. Thatís not border security. Thatís borderline crazy.The one truth the President did state is that there is a crisis at the border.There is a humanitarian crisis created by him.Itís a crisis when the President threatens to shut down the nationís legal immigration and asylum process over a border wall that is really just a campaign gimmick.It a crisis when the President spends 72 million of your tax dollars to send our military to the border to confront a threat that didnít exist, like he did in November, as a political stunt to rally the base.Itís a crisis when this Administration is allowing women and children ñ babies ñ to be dumped on American streets in the middle of the night with nothing more than the clothes on their back, without food, money, health screenings, or plans to get them to their destinations.And there is a crisis, when a government shutdown means that 800,000 federal workers are denied a paycheck this week, and now canít pay their mortgage or rent, student loans, or medical expenses, hurting their credit rating because our President wonít budge on his impossible wall.And by the way, this shutdown includes the Coast Guard, which is a cornerstone of our border security. How stupid is that?Mr. President, Senator McConnell ñ Democrats have laid out for you several border security measures we can all get behind. Letís re-open the government and talk about these ideas and quit holding the paychecks of 800,000 federal workers hostage to a wall that is never going to get built.îFollow Ian†Hanchett on Twitter†@IanHanchett

The world envies those institutions. Why do you think those people are lining up to get into our country? They want to be in a place that has those kinds of institutions.

I havenít done it yet,î the president said. ìIf this doesnít work out, probably I will do it, I would almost say definitely.îIn a recent interview with†KSL Newsradioís Dave & Dujanovic show, Romney called on the White House and Democrat leadership to reach a bipartisan agreement on wall funding which to end the government shutdown, now it isnít 21st day.†ìThe right approach is for there to be some kind of deal that can be done where both sides get something that they feel is important,î said the freshman senator. ìBut I donít see movement to suggest thatís about to happen.îThe Utah Republican expressed support for presidentís†position on building†a wall, stating it ìmakes all the sense in the world.îì[President Trump] has staked out his position and he wants to build a border barrier. Thatís something I concur with, by the way,î he noted.Romney also warned a national emergency declared by President Trump could set a president for future Democrat administrations to do the same for left-wing causes.†ìAnd I think we Republicans will be concerned that this kind of approach could be used by perhaps a Democrat president in the future, and thatís not something we want to see either,î he argued.While he did not propose for the president trade DACA for border wall funding, Romney argued that the time had come to address the issue, which would grant legal status to children brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents.ìWeíre not going to throw them out of the country, so thereís ground here to reach an outcome thatís good for both parties and thatís good for the country,î said Romney.Romney†quickly set himself apart from other Republicans in the new Congress with a blistering attack on President Trumpís leadership and character.Romney put to rest expectations that he would take his time getting his footing in Washington. Instead, in a Washington Post opinion-editorial published two days before he was sworn into office, Romney said the presidentís ìconduct over the past two years, particularly his actions last month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.îIn a Twitter response, President Trump said he hoped Romney wouldnít follow in the footsteps of† Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) who often criticized the president and paid the price, opting to retire rather than risk defeat in a GOP primary in 2018.ìWould much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful,î the president tweeted. ìI won big, and he didnít. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!îRomneyís remarks prompted swift backlash from allies of the president in the Republican Party ó including his own niece, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.McDaniel retweeted Trumpís remarks about Romney and added that the president is constantly ìattacked and obstructedî by the media and Democrats.ìFor an incoming Republican freshman senator to attackî Trump @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the Democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive,î McDaniel tweeted.Romney, who was soundly defeated by President Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election, heavily criticized then-candidate Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential race, describing him as a† ìcon man,î and a ìfake.î ìDishonesty is Donald Trumpís hallmark,î he said in the same speech. However, in a show of unity, president-elect Trump put aside Romneyís criticism, and interviewed him for the position of Secretary of State, a job which ultimately was given to former Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson. During the 2018 midterm election, President Trump supported Romney, an endorsement Romney gladly accepted.The Associated Press contributed to this report.†

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/01/10/dem-rep-hill-toddler-trumps-tantrum-shutdown-is-political-terrorism/,"Thursday on MSNBCís ìLive,î Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA), a newly sworn-in freshman member of the U.S. House, argued President Donald Trump was like ìa toddler having a tantrum,î which is resulting in the ìpolitical terrorismî of a government shutdown.Hill said, ìYou know, has nothing to do with any of the issues that heís suggesting and when you talk about declaring an emergency, a federal emergency, weíre from a state where we know all about emergencies and what should be a national emergency. And this is simply not one of them when youíre talking about pretend facts. You can say itís a true humanitarian crisis for the people trying to come here but it certainly is not a national emergency, and itís just like óit gets more and more frustrating every single day to see how irrational he is. We canít accept this anymore. We have to hold the line. This is like a toddler having a tantrum. This is unacceptable moving forward. Negotiate with us but not on the backs of people who again have nothing to do with it.îShe added, ìIn my district, we have a number of air traffic controllers, one actually came here from my district. Her name is Christie. Sheís a veteran, mother of two. She told me about the stress that this is putting her family through. I have stories of people whose kids are trying to open up lemonade stands because they want to help their parents. We have people picking up second jobs. This is with air traffic controllers. We have to have these people operating at 100 percent capacity, and they are picking up second jobs to pay their rent or mortgage. Talking to lawyers, itís not even an option. How are you going to pay them? Itís just óit really is a tragedy. this to me ó I know itís a strong word, but this is political terrorism.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

I hope it works.îSenate Judiciary Chair @LindseyGrahamSC: ìIt is time for President Trump to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier. I hope it works.î pic.twitter.com/y4LWRW8njjó Craig Caplan (@CraigCaplan) January 10, 2019Grahamís support for a declaration comes after expressing caution about the move earlier this week, saying it was not his ìpreferred routeî and should be a ìlast resort.î Speaking with reporters earlier Thursday, the South Carolina Republican said he doesnít see lawmakers will find a solution to end the†shutdown, which has entered its 20th day. †ìI have never been more depressed about moving forward than I am right now. I just donít see a pathway forward. Somebodyís got to like, get some energy to fix this,î he said.In a Fox News interview last week, Graham predicted it will likely be ìthe end of [the Trump] presidencyî if the president reopens the government without securing border wall funding.ìThis is a battle, to me, worth having, and I know itís inconvenient,î Graham told host Sean Hannity. ìBy the way, I support all those furloughed†employees. I donít want them caught in a political crossfire. They deserve their back-pay. Itís through no fault of there own that theyíre not viewed as essential services. But, does the president have other options for the wall?îìHeís not going to sign a bill that doesnít have money for the wall,î he continued. ìIf he gives in now, thatís the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective president. Thatís the probably the end of his presidency. Donald Trump has made a promise to the American people. Heís going to secure our border.îMeanwhile, President Trump, departing to the border town of McAllen, Texas, Thursday reiterated his willingness to declare a national emergency to build a southern border wall. Asked by reporters about a declaration, the president said as he left the White House, ìIím not prepared to do that yet, but if I have to I will.îìSo weíre either going to have a win, make a compromise óbecause I think a compromise is a win for everybodyó or I will declare a national emergency,î he added.Itís not clear what a compromise might entail. President Trump affirms he wonít reopen the government without money for the wall. Democrats say they favor measures to bolster border security but oppose the long, impregnable walling that President Trump envisions. He is asking $5.7 billion for wall construction.President Trumpís comments came a day after he walked out of a negotiating meeting with congressional leaders ó ìI said bye-bye,î he tweeted afterward.The White House meeting in the Situation Room ended after just 14 minutes. Democrats said they asked Trump to reopen the government but he told them if he did they wouldnít give him money for the wall. Republicans said Trump posed a direct question to Pelosi: If he opened the government, would she fund the wall? She said no.The Associated Press contributed to this report.†

I saw you, sir, vote for the wall.î the†Die Hard actor continued†as he wagged his finger disapprovingly.††ìYou voted for a wall, sir, several years ago. So did Ms. Pelosi.îRobert Davi then noted how Democrats, including Schumer and then-Sens. Barack Obama (D-IL) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY), voted for The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which funded a 700-mile long border fence to the tune of $50 billion over 25 years.ìHow come the networks arenít showing your flip-flopping?î Davi asked. ìShow that CNN, MSNBC! Show Schumer wanting a wall and now saying itís ëun-American, itís immoral.'îThe†The Expendables 3 speculated the establishment media wonít challenge Schumer and other Democrats†over their reversal because they possess a ìMarxist-Socialistî background.îDaviís remarks come as President Donald Trump visited the border wall town of†McAllen, Texas, to push his demand for a wall, one day after failed negotiations with Democrats to end the partial government shutdown.On Wednesday, Trump invited Democratic leaders to the White House and began by asking if they would approve the wall in exchange for him ending the government shutdown. When the Democrats said no, he walked out.ìA total waste of time,î the president tweeted of the meeting. ìI said bye-bye, nothing else works!îSchumer told reported that President Trump ìsort of slammed the table,î then ìgot up and walked out.îìAgain, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldnít get his way,î he claimed.The Texas trip gives the president yet another high-profile stage to push his wall plan, following a national television address Tuesday in which he reiterated†his demand for $5.7 billion for its construction.†ìWe want a secure country,î he told journalists just before departing.President Trump has reportedly stated that his administration is evaluating the possibility†of declaring a national emergency to build the wall.The†Agence France-Presse contributed to this report.†

Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security,î the president said in his nine-minute address, before lamenting a partial government shutdown entering†its 20th day Thursday, could come to an end with a ì45-minute meetingî with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority†Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).President Trump also highlighted the various crimes committed by illegal aliens, pledging to ìnever forget the painî of those he met who have been impacted.†ìHow much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/01/10/johnson-national-emergency-declaration-pandoras-box-likely-overturned-in-court/,"Thursday on ìThe Hugh Hewitt Show,î†Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) said it is likely if President Donald Trump†declared a national emergency to build a border wall it would be overturned in the courts.Partial transcript as follows:JOHNSON: Well, first of all, I think the President will. Heís certainly shown himself more than capable of standing his ground whether you talk about trade or whether youíre talking about the border right now. And from my standpoint, I think one of the things Republicans ought to be looking at is just some really bare bones budgets. You know, acknowledging the fact that we are requiring people that are essential for national homeland security to work, we should pay those individuals. We should be preparing, and Iím actually working on a piece of legislation, thereís already one right now that Iím a co-sponsor of to fund the Coast Guard, but other essential personnel, we should pay those people. Hopefully, the administration will agree to do something like that. Hopefully, Mitch McConnell will bring it up on the floor of the Senate. I donít think we should be fully opening these agencies, because Democrats simply will not negotiate in good faith if we were to do something like that. And of course, Nancy Pelosi was very clear in the White House yesterday that when President Trump said well, if we open up the government, will you work with me? You know, will I get my barrier funding? And she said no. And so again, the Democrats are being hypocritical. Theyíre paying lip service to border security. Barriers actually work. They absolutely do. We need them. Itís kind of a first step table stakes issue. But theyíre playing politics. And I hope the President stands strong.HEWITT: Should the President invoke a national emergency declaration even though there are good arguments on both sides whether or not that is Constitutional?JOHNSON: Yeah, you know, I hope he doesnít. I think that does open up a Pandoraís Box. I think weíd be far better off, again, with a very bare bones type of budget funding essential personnel, making sure those individuals get paid, funding just essential services of these agencies that are shut down right now. You know, one thing from a conservative standpoint, we could really take a look at, you know, where is the fat in some of these agencies and simply donít fund it. And I think that would provide a fair amount of pressure on Democrats to really come to the negotiating table in good faith.HEWITT: But the consequences are spreading. I know one person whose home purchase is screwed up, because FEMA canít issue flood insurance, and the cost of private flood insurance is prohibitive. And so there are consequences to a government shutdown that very few people see, but a lot of people feel. Iím not sure of the politics of this, but a national emergency declaration would allow you to reopen the government and then move the conversation to the courts, although as an Article I guy, youíre not going to like the idea that Article II can act unilaterally.JOHNSON: No, I donít think any of us should. And letís face it, I think we probably understand what the courts would rule in this case. I mean, theyíre going to take it up to the 9th Circuit, and we know the result of that, so we still wonít get the barrier. So I want the barrier. I want a secure border. And I think the best way to do that is to acknowledge the fact, you know, the President was, came to our lunch yesterday, told everybody to hang together. You know, Iím all for doing that. Iím happy to hang with him. There will be increasing pressure, and legitimate pressure. I mean, there are some people really being harmed by this. Thereís no doubt about it. So letís address that specifically. Donít completely reopen these agencies, but we should be ready with Plan B as Democrats, as Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer continue to dig in, letís give them basically an offer that they simply canít refuse, but still puts an awful lot of pressure on them to negotiate in good faith and provide the barrier funding that we need.HEWITT: But that ends up, again, leaving if not 800,000 people out of a paycheck, 400,000 people without a paycheck and the consequences of a shutdown, whereas a national emergency declaration allows you to reopen the government and moves the question of the presidentís power concerning the border squarely, and Jonathan Turley has written a great piece on this in the Hill. I know youíre an Article I guy. But Iím not sure, it goes to the 9th Circuit, theyíll lose in the 9th Circuit. It would go up to the Supreme Court. Are you sure it would lose at the Supreme Court, Senator Johnson?JOHNSON: No, I have no idea. Iím not a lawyer. But letís face it. The administration hasnít been doing really well in court on a lot of these issues, because we still have a lot of very liberal, progressive judges that are not going to really rule based on what the law is. Itís going to be based on their policy preference. So letís face it. Our courts have become very politicized, and that concerns me.HEWITT: Now, but do you believe if it got to the Supreme Court where there is a 5 member conservative majority, that he would win there on his right to protect the border via unilateral action?JOHNSON: I really donít know.HEWITT: I donít think anyone does. Thatís the right answer. I donít think anyone does. So given that itís an open question, and I know Jonathan Turley thinks itís an open question, youíll get some ideologues and both sides who will say itís a closed question. Itís not. Nobody knows what they would do. The key case here is Youngstown Sheet and Tube. Given that that is an open question, isnít that preferred to opening the government sort of halfway? Or do you think yours is the preferred solution?JOHNSON: Well, again, I want to maintain pressure, because I actually do want to fund this wall the sooner the better. You know, Hugh, we do have a crisis. You know, it drives me crazy how Democrats are minimizing this problem. You know, in 2014, remember that enormous humanitarian crisis of unaccompanied children? Everybody recognized it. The Obama administration responded to it. The CBP was praised for treating these kids with real humanity. About 120,000 kids and family members came in, in 2014. Last year, 145,000 unaccompanied children and people in family units came into this country illegally. In the first three months of this fiscal year, 75,000 just family units have come in. so this is a growing problem, because we have a broken legal system. You know, we have the Flores reinterpretation, which is creating these incentives for people to come to this country. And once they get here, they are home free. And when I hear Democrats talk about technology on the border, I mean, thatís fine. We can track somebody, we can apprehend them. We process them. And then we disburse them, and theyíre here to stay, because if we donít detain them, itís almost impossible to remove them. Thatís the incentive that is fueling this growing crisis of unaccompanied children and families coming through our borders illegally And Hugh, thereís nothing humane about incentivizing girls to come up, a third of them, I think thatís a low estimate, get sexually assaulted. Iíve seen the pictures of a dead, desiccated animal-chewed bodies in the desert because we incentivize people to try and come to this country illegally. Thereís nothing humane about that. That is the crisis.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

His intent is to reprogram Department of Defense money, five billion dollars. Apparently, theyíve already found it. But he also knows that the Democrats will immediately†challenge him in court ó just like the DACA deal. And so, he expects that, but then, he would be able to re-open the government and then tell his supporters, ìlook, I did everything I could. If you want a clear victory, elect more Republicans to the Congress.îBRIAN KILMEADE: It would just be a disaster in the big picture and just show us being inept and unable to govern around the world. And, it would just set a terrible precedent. They will continue ó as Erik Erikson brought up, he said: ìlook, the next president, if it is a liberal president, will say a state of emergency will be climate change. Look at what happened with [Hurricane] Sandy, look at what happened with the earthquake, look at whatís happening to the polar bears, whoíve no place to walk on ice.î This would be a bad sign that the courts are forced to do something that politicians canít, and that is come up with solutions to problems.AINSLEY†EARHARDT: Well, authorities down in Mexico realize that itís a problem there in their country. as well. You always talk about the southern border down there. There are 12 legal ports of entry, that Southern†side of Mexico, whether there are borders with Guatemala and Belize, and authorities†have identified†370 additional illegal ports of entry.

A close look at the battle reveals that except for some hardship for workers, the federal bureaucracy is up and running.The shutdown also sheds light on how massive the government is and could spark debate about the difference between ó and the necessity for both ó †ìessentialî and ìnon-essentialî workers.Reuters noted in its roundup of the shutdown impact that this is not a Trump presidency phenomenon. The government has been temporarily shuttered 19 times since the mid-1970s.†ìThe current shutdown has not affected three-quarters of the government, including the Department of Defense and the Postal Service, which have secure funding,î Reuters reported. ìBut 800,000 employees from the departments of Homeland Security and Transportation, among others, have been furloughed or are working without pay.îThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS):At the IRS, 88 percent of the 70,000 people working are deemed non-essential. †Despite the drastic reduction in its workforce, Russ Vought, acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), has said Americans would get their tax refunds despite the shutdown.U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS)DHS is responsible for agencies under its purview, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Coast Guard, and the Secret Service.Almost all of the DHS employees ó 213,000 out of 245,000 ó are essential, according to the agencyís plan for operating during a government shutdown. That means they are still working but without pay until the government is fully funded.The leftist media has generated fake news about the TSA, saying workers are calling in sick putting the flying public in particular in peril. But Reuters reported ìthe TSA said on Tuesday the absences were having ëminimal impact.íî†ìThe agency said 4.6 percent of screeners did not show up for work on Monday, compared with 3.8 percent on the same day last yearî ó just over a 1 percent difference.U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)The Department of Housing and Urban Development, on the other hand, is operating with just over 300 employees, with 7,500 others furloughed because they are deemed ìnon-essential.îMoreover, even with the drastic cutback at †HUD, the most vulnerable populations the agency serves remain secure.†ìPublic housing authorities and Native American tribal housing entities are not part of the federal government and so are not required to shut down,î Reuters reported.HUDís contingency plans note that a prolonged shutdown could affect home sales ìreversing the trend toward a strengthening market,î under the Trump administration.U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI)While the National Park Service is operating with a ìskeleton staff,î volunteers have been stepping up to clean up sites in national parks and, according to media reports, some Americans have even donated money to help the parks weather the shutdown.In Washington, DC, the taxpayer-funded Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo are closed, although officials have reassured the public employees are caring for the animals at the zoo and the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia ó the zooís headquarters.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)Although some of the U.S. Food and Drug Administrationís (FDA) inspections arenít taking place, the agency has said it can respond to emergencies such as a food-borne illness outbreak.ìSome scientific research projects also cannot continue in full,î Reuters reported.U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)ìFood stamp recipients wonít miss their February benefits even if partial government shutdown continues, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Tuesday night,î UPI reported.ìThe agency found a way to fund the USDAís Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for 38 million Americans without new appropriations from Congress, the agency said in a news release.îU.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)At the Department of Transportation 20,400 of its 55,000 employees are on leave.ìThat excludes most of the Federal Aviation Administration, where 24,200 are working and the Federal Highway Administration (FHA) where all 2,700 employees are funded through other sources,î Reuters reported.The New York Times reported on Tuesday on the plight of federal workers who are either working without pay or are on leave. Those who donít have savings set aside for a rainy day are struggling to pay bills. Some are turning to credit cards.Tanisha Keller, who works for the U.S. Census Bureau, ìused to live paycheck to paycheck.îìNow sheís ìliving nothing to nothing,î the Times reported.Keller is counting on the government to make things right.ìThereís no cushion,î Keller said. ìWhen February rolls around, my rentís going to be due, and Iím going to need the nation to help.îCNBC reported on Wednesday that the Democrats had changed their talking points in opposing Trumpís wall agenda to focus on workers like the ones the Times profiled.î[Trump] has chosen a wall over workers,î House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said on Wednesday as she and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) used furloughed employees as a backdrop for a press briefing. ìThe president needs to end his senseless shutdown and reopen the government.îìTrump, for his part, has downplayed the shutdownís effect on government workers,î CNBC reported. ìOn Sunday, the former real estate mogul claimed he ëcan relateí to federal employees who may not be able to pay bills.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2019/01/10/howard-stern-mocks-morons-who-support-trumps-border-wall/,"Veteran radio host†Howard Stern on Wednesday mocked President Donald Trumpís proposal U.S.-Mexico border wall, describing it as a†political gimmick†to whip up support from†ìmorons.îAs the partial government†shutdown†extends†into its third week, President Trump and Democrat leaders remain at an impasse over the presidentís commitment to sign legislation securing $5.6 billion to build a Southern border. Signaling†a willingness to comprise on his chief campaign promise, the president is open to erect†a steel barrier instead one comprised of concrete. On Wednesday, President Trump walked out of a meeting at the White House with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) after they reiterated their stance against funding the wall and extra security measures.
On his radio show Wednesday, Stern slammed President Trumpís Oval Office address and proposed border security measures.†ìThe wallís a problem because itís a waste of money, even Donald knows that,î Stern, whose relationship with President Trump spans†decades, claimed.ìYou gotta know Donald a bit to understand whatís going on here. The wallís a simplistic answer to our problems with immigration. Itís something that, you know, morons can get behind because theyíre like, ëOh yeah, if you build a wall no one can get over it.í But itís not that simple,î Stern continued.The longtime shock jock then ripped the president for seeking $5.6 billion in border wall funding, arguing the amount is billions less than the wallís true price tag.ìYouíre talking about building a massive wall across this country on the southern border. Itís a tremendous amount of property and a tremendous amount of area to cover,î Stern told his listeners. ìYouíre not going to get a whole wall for $5 billion. If you really want a wall, itís probably going to cost you some trillions of dollars.îìI would love to see Donald come on last night and go, ëFuck this, Iím not going to bullshit you guys. I want $20 billion,î he added.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2019/01/09/chinese-media-shutdown-cruelly-deprives-americans-vital-panda-cam/,"The Chinese Communist Peopleís Daily Online spoke up on Tuesday for an overlooked class of victims from the U.S. government shutdown: panda enthusiasts deprived of the Smithsonian National Zooís Giant Panda Cam.ìSmithsonianís National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute managed to stay open for the first 11 days of the shutdown, which began on December 22, 2018, but was forced to close its doors on Tuesday, Jan. 1, after its prior-year funds ran out because Congress and the White House are unable to reach a funding agreement. The much-loved Giant Panda Cam went black the following day on Wednesday,î the Peopleís Daily reported.According to the Smithsonian National Zoo, the live animal cameras ìrequire federal resources, primarily staff, to run and broadcast,î and since they have been deemed non-essential, they ìwill not stream live until the federal government reopens.îThe Peopleís Daily found the geopolitical significance in this abrupt cessation of real-time panda activity monitoring:The unfortunate situation is that until a deal is reached to end the shutdown, panda fans will be unable to enjoy the 24/7 live broadcast of resident giant pandas Tian Tian, Mei Xiang, and Bei Bei chomping on bamboo, playing in trees, and tumbling in the grass.This may seem like a trivial matter. But for some, the loss has been unbearable, and they are calling for an end to the shutdown so that they can get on with life and enjoy watching the pandas.Some people have even called it a step too far and are outraged at the US government for being unable to do its job and reach a deal.Alas, the Peopleís Daily did not see fit to quote any of those people. It did, however, quote some Chinese commenters who took advantage of the situation to mock American charges against the Chinese state:On the English-language website of Peopleís Daily Online, one reader joked that China might need to place a guard around the pandas for safekeeping and possibly live stream it to the world.Another reader wondered if the giant pandas will be detained for ìspyingî and, if so, be put in a CIA black site because they may feel threatened by the intelligence of the pandas.Some even went further and joked that the US government might use the opportunity to comb through panda waste for alleged ìtechnology theft.îThe Communist paper wrapped up by using the U.S. government shutdown to tout the wonders of Chinese authoritarianism, under which the cameras pointed at pandas and humans alike are never turned off:The loss of the Zooís panda cam, while relatively minor in terms of overall impact of the shutdown, is just another sign that US democracy has become what American scholar Francis Fukuyama and others have labeled as a ìvetocracyî ó meaning the US government has become dangerously ineffective.Zhang Weiwei, a Chinese professor at Fudan University who has debated Fukuyama on such issues, has argued that the separation of powers in the United States has its weaknesses, as many vested interest groups fight against each other to block reform initiatives that are necessary for the country. As Professor Zhang has pointed out, it is getting harder to build a social consensus within the Western democratic countries. And as a result, the Western system of democracy has become more and more problematic.That is Chinaís ideological sales pitch in a nutshell: authoritarian rule is more effective than democracy because maximum leaders get things done. Whatever one might think of democracyís flaws and the reasons for them ñ Fukuyamaís point about ìvetocracyî is far more nuanced than the Peopleís Daily presents it, and slipping into Chinese-style autocracy is one of his major concerns ñ a temporarily blacked-out panda cam seems like a modest price to pay for the freedom to disagree.Fortunately, thanks to the wealth and innovative spirit of free-market capitalism in a representative republic, Americans have more than one panda cam to fill their needs. For example, the Panda Cam at the San Diego Zoo was up and running as of 3:00†p.m. Eastern time, affording a spectacular view of a pandaís posterior as the animal snoozed away the afternoon in a tree.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/09/government-shutdown-wont-affect-food-benefits-february/,"President Donald Trump directed agencies to ensure government food benefits will be dispensed in February despite a partial government shutdown.Congress has failed to pass a funding bill that secures the border, but President Trump has secured the nutrition low-income Americans need, according to a release from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).†ìAt President Trumpís direction, we have been working with the Administration on this solution.†It works and is legally sound,î Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Tuesday.†ìWe want to assure states, and SNAP recipients, that the benefits for February will be provided.îUSDA funding expired on December 21, 2018, as no funding bill made it through both Houses of Congress to keep a portion of the federal government open.At the presidentís direction, the Office of Management and Budget has been working with agencies like USDA to find funding for prioritized programs like SNAP.The Trump administration has developed a strategy under the law to keep government nutrition programs providing services through February. Part of this solution involves directing states to submit a request for early issuance instead of operating under the regular monthly submission process. States must make their request by January 20, as this is within the 30-day provision allowed for the government food programs under the continuing resolution.Early issuance has been used in disaster situations such as impending hurricanes to issue these benefits ahead of a potential disaster in preparation. Secretary Perdue and Brandon Lipps, acting deputy under secretary of Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services (FNS), confirmed on a Tuesday conference call that this is being done without dipping into the $3 billion contingency fund.When asked what happens if the shutdown extends into March, Secretary Perdue urged that Congress fund border security as part of a bill to reopen the federal government. He pressed that the temporary solution to funding nutrition programs through February gives Congress ample time to act.Under the determined solution, those covered under SNAP will receive their benefits as usual without disruption. The USDA has ensured that other major nutrition assistance programs will have the necessary funding to proceed through February without interruptions.ìSNAP monthly issuance for February is estimated to be approximately $4.8 billion and State administrative expense (SAE) is estimated at about $350 million for a total need of approximately $5.1 billion,î according to a USDA release. The process does require careful coordination between the agency and states.ìThe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,†and Children (WIC) has prior year funding which USDA will begin to provide states this week to facilitate February benefits,î according to the USDA. ìOther FNS programs, which provide critical assistance to our nationís food banks, the elderly, and Tribal nations, may continue to utilize grant funding provided prior to the lapse in appropriations. Commodity deliveries to those programs will continue.îMichelle Moons is a White House Correspondent for Breitbart News ó follow on Twitter @MichelleDiana and Facebook.

The senator added border security can be implemented in another way, but did not give any specific examples.ìIt is inhumane that tiny children at the border have been torn away from their parents,î continued Sanders, who also suggested that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients were additional victims of the president.The senator added that it is ìheartbreakingî that nearly ì11 million undocumented peopleî worry about whether or not they will be deported and ìseparated from their loved ones.îDuring Sandersí response to President Trump, the senator did not, however, mention officer Ronil Singh, who was fatally shot by an illegal alien one day after Christmas, permanently separating him from his wife and five-month-old son.Instead, Sanders accused the president of trying to ìcreate fear and hatredî for speaking of such incidences, and that the real crisis was not about our southern border, but instead, about health insurance, student loan debt, and workers earning ìstarvation wages,î among other issues.ìThatís a crisis!î exclaimed Sanders, dismissing the presidentís concerns.Sanders also claimed that ìthousands die each yearî due to not having health insurance, but that the ìbiggest crisis of allî is probably climate change.ìThe scientific community has made it very clear in telling us that climate change is real and is causing devastating harm to our country and the entire planet,î concluded Sanders in his response to President Trump, adding that the entire planet will likely become ìunhealthy and even uninhabitable in the not so distant future.îThe senator finished by informing the president that his address to the nation regarding border security was simply creating ìartificial crises,î and that the government shutdown must end.You can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo and on Instagram.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/08/president-trumps-oval-office-address-on-border-crisis-sets-the-stage-for-2020/,"President Trumpís address to the nation from the Oval Office on the border crisis Tuesday evening set the stage for the 2020 presidential campaign.The president began his eight minute address by noting that ìThere is a growing security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border.îIt is, he added, ìa crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.îHe then outlined the statistical evidence that proves the crisis and added to that the very personal details of individual Americans killed by illegal aliens in this country.Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), two of the least popular politicians in the country, sounded a very different tone in the Democratic response.The president is trying to ìmanufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from turmoil,î Schumer said.The real issue should be ending the federal government shutdown, the Democratic leaders argued.Both claimed Democrats also want border security, but methods other than a wall should be used to accomplish that.ìThe fact is,î Pelosi asserted, ìwalls are an expensive and ineffective wayî to address border security.Trump made no mention that he is considering the possibility of declaring a national emergency in order to build the wall using Department of Defense funding, as many expected.That option, however, looms over his invitation to Democrats to meet with him in the White House tomorrow.As Breitbartís Joel Pollak noted, the president talked victims, while Schumer and Pelosi talked government.Going in to the presidentís Oval Office address, more Americans agreed with the president than agreed with Schumer and Pelosi.A poll released by Morning Consult and Politico earlier on Tuesday showed that a plurality of Americans support President Trumpís assertion that the country is facing a crisis at the border, as Breitbart News reported:Forty-two percent of voters say†the ìU.S. is facing a†crisis,î while only 37 percent say the ìU.S. is facing a problem,î according†to the†poll†of 1,989 registered†voters, which was conducted with Politico.Amid the flows of migrants and drugs from Central†America, 12 percent say the U.S. ìisnít facing a†problem or crisis,î according to the poll, which was conducted January 4 to 6.Among Republicans, 72 percent believe the U.S. is facing a crisis, 19 percent believe itís a problem, and four percent say thereís neither a problem nor a crisis.Among Democrats, only 19 percent believe the U.S. is facing a crisis, 52 percent believe itís a problem, and 21 percent say thereís neither a problem nor a crisis.Among Independents, 37 percent believe the U.S. is facing a crisis, 37 percent believe itís a problem, and ten percent say thereís neither a problem nor a crisis.As the 2016 presidential results proved, however, aggregate voter behavior at the national level does not determine who is elected president by the electoral college.Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a 48 percent to 46 percent margin, but Donald Trump won the electoral college vote (excluding the seven faithless electors) by a 306 to 232 margin.What matters in determining who will receive a majority of the electoral college votes necessary to win the 2020 presidential election is voter behavior at the state level, and specifically, voting behavior in 17 battleground states where the outcome of the 2020 presidential election is uncertain. (Those 17 states include Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Maine, North Carolina, Virginia, and Florida).No matter who the Democratic nominee is, 13 blue states and the District of Columbia are certain to vote for the Democrat. (Those 13 states include Hawaii, Oregon, Washington, California, Illinois, New York, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Rhode Island.)President Trump, the likely Republican nominee, is almost certain to win 20 red states (Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Utah, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi,† Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Wyoming.)The president and the Democratic leaders spelled out two vastly different views of what is important to the American people Tuesday evening.Republicans almost universally rallied to the presidentís call to action, while Democrats stood by Pelosi and Schumer.Those competing views will set the stage for the next 22 months of political battle leading up to the November 2020 presidential election.While the argument may well make the blue states bluer, and the red states redder, and perhaps even give the Democrat candidate a greater popular vote margin in 2020 than Hillary Clinton had in 2016, in the end, it will be how those arguments play out in the minds of voters in the 17 battleground states that will determine who secures the electoral college majority to win the presidency in 2020.

Hopefully, we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security,î he stated. ìThis situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting.îPresident Trump listed gruesome examples of crimes committed by illegal immigrants, including a ìbeheading and dismembering,î and vowed to ìnever forget the painî of survivors he met.ìHow much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job? For those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask to imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken,î the president said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.†

What was most apparent was the degree in which he appears to be an utterly defeated and broken man ó somebody who feels the walls closing in on him. It was the low-energy speech. I suspect the political consequence of it will be that Republicans are going to crack. Theyíre going to take a walk in the serious way for the first time during the Trump presidency.îHe continued, ìOf course, Trump claimed full credit for it, celebrated it, said he would be proud of the shutdown. And so we see now Republicans living with the consequences of having an inept lying, incompetent, racially demagoguing president talking about this issue. îHe added, ìThis is a con man at work. And what weíre seeing here is that the wizard has been exposed. At rally after rally, what did he say? Many billions of times the Mexicans would pay for the wall. Where are the pesos? Heís talking about $5 billion when he told the American people over and over again that there would be a wall, a wall paid for by Mexico. There is no wall. There will never be a wall. No wall will ever be funded. And he has denied this central victory against all the racial demagoguery we saw from the moment he descended the escalator at Trump Tower. Itís all becoming undone. And that desperation, I think, was on full display today. And of all the things you could say about Trump until tonight, the one thing you really couldnít say is that heís boring. He was just boring tonight. The shtick is getting old. It was to some degree like the episode when Fonzie jumped the shark tonight, coining that famous phraseology.

The president is facing many challenges this evening. He needs to convince at least some of the 57% of the public who oppose a border wall that there is a clear and present need for one. He needs to buck up wavering Republicans on Capitol Hill whose constituents are starting to feel the pain of the government shutdown, convincing them that the current standoff is worth it. And if convincing the public that problems add up to the crisis, the president needs to surmount his own crisis of credibility. Polls suggest roughly 60% of the public considers the president to be dishonest and untrustworthy. And there may be no issue where the president and his administration have been more misleading than on the subject of immigration.îAfter highlighting the administrationís comments on terrorists crossing at the southern border, Trump changing the wall from concrete to steel, and the presidentís claim former presidents said they should have built a wall, Tapper said, ìTrumpís own senior administration officials privately acknowledge that the continued spreading of falsehoods about this issue has created a real problem as the president takes to the mound and prepares to make his pitch.îHe concluded, ìItís almost as if the public canít even hear what the president has to say because around the issue of border security there has been built a wall, a wall of misinformation, a wall of lies.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/08/chamber-of-commerce-end-shutdown-by-giving-amnesty-to-illegal-aliens/,"U.S. Chamber of Commerce executives are urging the split Republican-Democrat Congress and President Trump to end the government shutdown by giving amnesty to more than three million illegal aliens.In a letter to Congress, Chamber of Commerce Vice President Neil Bradley writes that Republicans and Democrats must come together to grant amnesty to about 3.5 million illegal aliens enrolled and eligible for President Obamaís Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.Bradley writes:We urge members of Congress and the administration to expeditiously complete legislation to re-open the federal government and seize the opportunity to both improve border security and provide protection for Dreamers and long-term TPS beneficiaries. [Emphasis added]The Chamber of Commerce executive claims the DACA amnesty is necessary for the ìlong-term healthî of the American economy.ìThe Chamber supports a deal that combines increasing border security with protection and legal status for Dreamers and long-term beneficiaries of the TPS program,î Bradley continues. ìThese are important policy objectives that would improve the near-term and long-term health of our economy while also demonstrating that it is indeed possible for policymakers to make progress on a politically fraught issue.îCorporate interests and the big business lobby have the most to gain from granting an amensty to DACA illegal aliens, as legalizing millions of low-skilled foreign workers would drag down wages for Americans, drive up profit margins for corporations, and leave U.S. taxpayers with the costs.The ëAmnesty Firstí Trap: Trump Supporters Concerned Trade to End Shutdown Would Cause Illegal Immigration Surgehttps://t.co/X7IXb7kdMXó John Binder <U+0001F47D> (@JxhnBinder) January 8, 2019A DACA amnesty would put more U.S.-born children of illegal aliens ó commonly known as ìanchor babiesî ó on federal welfare, as†Breitbart News†reported, while†American taxpayers would be left with a†$26 billion†bill.Additionally, about†one in five†DACA illegal aliens, after an amnesty, would end up on food stamps, while at least†one in seven†would go on Medicaid.Any plan to give amnesty to DACA illegal aliens that does not also include provisions to halve legal immigration levels would give amnestied illegal aliens the opportunity to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country through the process known as ìchain migration.îThe†chain migration†inflow from a DACA amnesty has the potential to reach nine million foreign nationals arriving in the country, as every two newly naturalized citizens bring about seven foreign relatives to the U.S. with them.Despite major opposition from Trumpís base of supporters to for an amnesty-for-wall funding deal, the plan has been touted in White House discussions, as it is favored by the billionaire donor class.John Binder is a reporter†for Breitbart News.

Eighty-three percent of Republicans and 13 percent of Democrats support the wall, while 83 percent of Democrats and 14 percent of Republicans†oppose the wall.However, the poll also†shows lopsided opposition to government shutdowns. Sixty-five percent of voters say ìPresidents should take all necessary steps to avoid a government shutdown.

And again, the American public deserves better. We have enough problems. One doesnít need to create a problem. One does not need to create a problem. This issue is about a vanity project for this president. And it is a problem of his own making.

Heís not going step away from it. Heís going to have a prime-time address in the Oval Office tomorrow, and heís going to be talking to his base. Heís not talking to the country, like most presidents, Democrats, and Republicans, have done in the past. Heís just talking to his very small and shrinking base. We talk a lot about illegal immigrants, and thatís who he goes after. Thereís one more thing I want to say, we talk a lot about undocumented immigrants, and thatís whom he goes after. I think Donald Trump wants to get rid of legal immigration. And itís because of people who come from brown and black countries. Just a year ago, it was reported that he said, ëI donít want anybody coming. Why do we have to have people from African nations, s-hole countries?'îShe added, ìThat was just a year ago. Heís made himself really clear from the moment he announced coming down the escalator, talking about Mexicans are rapists.îJean-Pierre continued, ìHe said he wants people from Nordic countries.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/07/exclusive-kris-kobach-a-wall-stops-illegal-immigration-drones-and-sensors-dont/,"Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach says only a wall can stop illegal immigration, while promises of ìborder securityî with ìdrones and sensorsî merely facilitate crossings at the United States-Mexico border.In an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriotís Breitbart News Sunday, Kobach says it is a border wall, coupled with U.S. Border Patrol, that can stop soaring illegal immigration at the southern border, not the Democratsí and Republican establishmentís preferred promise of ìborder securityî measures.Kobach said:The argument we sometimes hear from people who say they want border security but really arenít serious about it is ëOh, weíll just have drones and sensors.í Well, a drone and a sensor tells you that somebody is entering the United States, it doesnít stop the person from entering the United States. The wall is exactly, the single most effective tool, other than Border Patrol agents, and thatís what we need. The American people recognize it. [Emphasis added]Listen to Kobachís full interview here:Kobach said a wall along the southern border is immensely popular with Americans, pointing to the GoFundMe campaign that has raised close to $20 million to fund a border wall.ìWe the American people are so desperate for a wall, so desperate for control of our southern border that literally [hundreds of] thousands of people have donated millions of dollars Ö in a 19 day period, the GoFundMe campaign raised $19 million, which is just staggering,î Kobach said. ìThereís never been a campaign on GoFundMe thatís raised money that quickly.îìItís amazing that the most basic, straightforward appropriate the money, build the wall option is encountering so much resistance among the open border crowd in Congress,î Kobach said.The loyal Trump supporter revealed he is also considering a run for the U.S. Senate to replace Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS), who announced his retirement.ìSecuring our nationís border and stopping this illegal immigration problem thatís been plaguing this country for so many decades is one of my top priorities,î Kobach said. ìItís been the central focus of my career, so one way or the other, Iím going to keep pushing towards that objective.îìIn the months ahead, if running for the Senate is the best way to achieve that objective, then Iíd certainly consider it even more seriously,î Kobach said.The federal government has been partially shut down for more than 15 days now as Republicans, Democrats, and the Trump administration have yet to reach a deal to fund a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal immigration.Meanwhile, border-crossings in November 2018 hit†close to†52,000, marking the highest level of illegal immigration in the month of November since 2006. Projections indicate that illegal immigration for next year will reach 600,000 border crossings, the highest level of illegal immigration in more than a†decade.Breitbart News Sunday†is broadcast live on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. eastern.John Binder is a reporter†for Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/07/the-nuclear-option-time-for-taxpayer-shutdown/,"Well, this is awkward.The federal government has been shut down for three weeks now and it is hard to find a single tax-paying, Average-Joe citizen who has been affected ó unless, of course, you happen to work for Uncle Sam.It is literally true that you could go from building to building along the National Mall and completely shutter a good number of federal government agencies and it would take years before the first regular American knew the departments had been killed off. (Except, of course, for the incessant, alarmist yammering about it from the left-wing media.)Sure, itís a big deal if you are a federal employee or a contractor who earns a living off the Byzantine web of debilitating red tape and federal bureaucratic regulations that define most of the federal government these days. Otherwise, even if you are actively looking for ways the government shutdown might affect you, it is nearly impossible.Now, stop and think about that. Take a look at your last pay stub. Look at the percentage of your check that went to Uncle Sam. You didnít even get to hold that money. It just got dumped right into the government coffers.Now compare that amount of money that you spend on something else. Say, a car payment. Or bills around the house. The house note.Now consider that you made your payment every month on that car ó but you never got to drive the car you were paying for. Or you paid all your house bills but the heat never came on.The lights never worked. Or, if they did, they came on so dimly that you couldnít actually see the light.What is the difference between that and dutifully paying your taxes every pay period for services from the federal government that you actually never even notice?Obviously, there are exceedingly important, yet amorphous, things that your payment to the federal government pays for. The most important, of course, being enough aircraft carrier groups that nobody gets any funny ideas about invading our rich little island home here.But even when it comes to this ó the single most important job of the federal government ó Washington fails.Sure, we have the greatest, most powerful military ever assembled by human beings. But we have an illegal invasion of millions of immigrants across our Southern border and these people cannot even build a wall to stop it.Of course, the idea that the federal government can be shut down for weeks and nobody notices is a matter of great alarm to the left-wing media.So, they write wacky stories to scare you into thinking that this government shutdown is actually something terribly grave.ìThree dead in national park system as shutdown wears on.î I am not making this up. This took not one but two crack reporters from The Washington Post to think that one up.I am not sure which is worse: Reporters so stupid that they think a federal government employee could have prevented these accidents or a couple of reporters so craven that thought it was acceptable to politicize such tragedies.Either way, the biggest outrage in the whole sordid mess is that even though nobody seems to notice that the government has been shut down for three weeks, innocent taxpayers are still paying all the bills.You know, if Republicans in Washington were actually serious about winning one of these government shutdowns, they should immediately introduce legislation to bar the federal government from collecting any taxes while the government is closed. No work, no pay.Now, that is a fight that even Republicans could win.ï Contact Charles Hurt at†churt@washingtontimes.com†or on Twitter @charleshurt.

Trump spoke at length about the issue during a Rose Garden press conference with reporters on Friday and spoke to reporters twice on Sunday as he traveled to and from a staff meeting at Camp David.As the fight heats up, the president still has two cards to play in the messaging war with Democrats.Trump allies continue to press for the president to deliver an Oval Office address to the nation about the crisis at the border.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/03/democrat-spending-bill-offers-12-billion-more-for-foreign-aid-0-for-border-wall/,"The spending bills proposed by House Democrats to end the partial government shutdown offer no funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, but provide over $12 billion more in foreign aid than the Trump administration requested, according to a statement on Thursday from the White House Office of Management and Budget.The statement warned the new House Democrat majority of President Trumpís intention to veto the bills, noting that the administration ìcannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the Nationís urgent border security needs.îThe statement reiterated President Trumpís request for ìat least $5 billion for border securityî and asserted that the Democratsí proposal ìdoes not come close to providing these necessary investments and authorities.îThe White House then highlighted the billions in funding the Democrats are offering for ìunnecessary programs at excessive levelsî beyond what the Trump administration requested, including:The statementís full passage regarding the Democratsí additional funding reads:The six bills provided for under H.R. 21 provide funding at levels nearly 20 percent higher than the Presidentís FY 2019 Budget. For instance, H.R. 21 provides $12 billion more for international affairs programs, 29 percent higher than the Presidentís request. This includes $2.9 billion more than the request for economic and development assistance, including funding for the West Bank/Gaza, Syria, and Pakistan, where our foreign aid is either frozen or under review. It includes $700 million more than requested for the United Nations, including restoring funding for the United Nations Population Fund. The bill would also undermine the Presidentís Mexico City Policy (Presidential Memorandum of January 23, 2017), which prohibits the funding of foreign nongovernmental organizations that promote or perform abortions. Further, H.R. 21 includes approximately $2 billion in excessive Environmental Protection Agency funding, providing funds beyond the Agencyís core mission and including funding for programs that can and should be executed at the local level. The bill also includes substantial unrequested funding for HUD programs, including $7.1 billion above the FY 2019 Budget request for HUD rental assistance programs. These and other excessive spending items makes the lack of adequate border funding in the combined package all the more unacceptable.ìThe administration looks forward to working with the Congress to enact appropriations that will adequately secure the Nationís borders and get the federal government back to work for the American people as soon as possible,î the statement concluded.Update: The Democrat spending bills passed the House on Thursday night. The first bill, a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8, passed by 239-192. The bill would ìkeep border security funding at $1.3 billion, providing no new funding for the barrier along the southern border,î the Hill reports. The second bill to fund the other six agencies through September passed by†241-190.

We believe the wall is wrong on many counts. The wall is ineffective, most experts agree with that. The wall is expensive,î Schumer stated. ìHe says itís a campaign pledge he must keep. That was not his campaign pledge. His campaign pledge was to build the wall and have Mexico pay for it, not American taxpayers. So itís not a campaign pledge.îHe added, ìThe Trump administration has not even spent the border security funding allocated by Congress last year.îSchumer then stated he had much rather have the Statue of Liberty represent America than a border wall.ìTo so many Americans, we do not want the wall to be a symbol of America. Much preferring the Statue of Liberty be that symbol. The symbolism is bad for the country, for our economy, for our security, for our ability to get along in the world.îìDemocrats certainly support strong, effective border security,î Schumer argued. ìFencing, drones, technology, roads. What the experts say actually works.îSchumer then said he asked the president on ìmultiple occasionsî during their meeting why ìlarge portions of the governmentî should be shut down while having a separate debate about the border.Schumer claims Trump ìcouldnít name one.îìPresident Trump is holding the government hostage over his wall, using the well-being of millions of Americans in a futile attempt to get what he wants. A concrete border wall,î Schumer claimed.In concluding his speech, Schumer said, ìWe have given our Republican†colleagues a way out of the shutdown based on Republican approved proposals. All leader McConnell needs to do to reopen the government is to bring to the floor the legislation that he, and nearly every other Republican†senator, already supports.îFollow Kyle on Twitter @RealKyleMorris and Facebook.

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) predicted Wednesday†evening that it will likely be ìthe end of [the Trump] presidencyî if the president reaches an agreement with Democrats to end the government shutdown without funding for a southern border wall.A partial transcript is as follows:SEAN HANNITY: You offered a compromise [to end the shutdown]. Now, Democrats also say they care about the DACA kids. What is your compromise?SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM: The compromise†is [to] give the president the $5 billion we need for walls [and] border security as a down payment to securing the border. The DACA population is about 700,000. Give them work permits, three-year work permits, so they donít have to worry about getting deported anytime soon. The TPS people who came here years ago from war-torn areas, hurricanes, and floods, and renew their legal status ó no pathway to citizenship ó and call it a day. Itís called a compromise. The president said, ìletís make a deal.î The Democratís response†is, basically, ìgot to hell.î Theyíre going to send a bill from the House to the Senate that has no money for the wall. Itís not going to see the light of day. Mitch McConnell is never going to bring a bill on to the floor of the Senate that doesnít have money for the wall. We need the wall. Theyíve all voted for the wall. And the only way weíre going to get the wall is to fight for it.HANNITY: This is a battle, to me, worth having, and I know itís inconvenient. By the way, I support all those furloughed†employees. I donít want them caught in a political crossfire. They deserve their back-pay. Itís through no fault of there own that theyíre not viewed as essential services. But, does the president have other options for the wall?ÖSEN. GRAHAM:† You can move some money around, but heíll get sued. There will be lawsuits in California to stop any effort to have other agencies fund the border, but there is some money you could use for sure. But, why should this president have to play that game? Why should Donald Trump have to do that, when Democratic presidents and Republican presidents in the past were able to get money to secure the border from Democrats?ÖHANNITY: If this takes 150 days, I think the Republican Party needs to stand united with the president. I have confidence in you. I donít have confidence in some of your colleagues, but saving lives, stopping drug trafficking, and human trafficking is worth the fight. Will the president hold the line?SEN. GRAHAM: Let me tell you how our government works. Any bill passed in the House has to come from the Senate, has to get 60 votes, and for it to be signed into law, the president has to sign it. Heís not going to sign a bill that doesnít have money for the wallÖ If he gives in now, thatís the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective president. Thatís the probably the end of his presidency. Donald Trump has made a promise to the American people. Heís going to secure our border.

One day tweeting a picture of these sort of Venetian blinds looking things and then the next day saying ëNo, no, itís still a wall.í Itís hard to deal with, and this is why you also have a Senate majority leader also saying we are not going to do anything until we know where he stands because they know that they canít necessarily trust that that he will keep a position that he takes from one day to the next.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

Linsdey Graham (R-SC) met with President Donald Trump over lunch on Sunday and suggested a new deal in which the president would renew 700,000 work permits in exchange for $5 billion towards border security.The premise upon which Grahamís deal is based is that Trump would win the court case currently working its way through the system about the legality of the administrationís decision to cancel President Barack Obamaís Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Trumpís decision was blocked by a California court, whose ruling is still awaiting an appeal decision before the Ninth Circuit.There would be no deal in which Trump offered legal status to all DACA-eligible illegal aliens ó those brought to the U.S. as minors, even if they did not apply for DACA status ó according to Graham. The veteran South Carolina Senator, a long-time advocate for immigration reform, said that even he would not provide DACA for $5 billion, because Democrats had refused to provide Trump with the full $25 billion requested for a border wall in return for legalization of all DACA-eligible illegal aliens earlier this year.Meanwhile, Graham said, Democrats might pass a new budget resolution in the House when they formally take the majority on Thursday, to re-open those parts of the government that had been shut down, but Trump would not sign it without at least $5 billion for border security. He suggested that the Senate would therefore never even consider that option.ìThe president is firm in his commitment to make sure we get money for border security, and there will never be a 60-vote deal in the Senate that doesnít include money for border security-slash-wall. And I donít see Democrats giving us more money unless they get something,î he said (via CNN).He added that the $5 billion would pay for ìborder security-slash-wall-slash-fencing, whatever you want to call it, in areas that make sense.îHe said that he might re-introduce a bipartisan proposal from three years ago called the ìBridge Act,î which he introduced with Sen. Dick Durban (D-IL), to protect the 700,000 DACA recipients for three years, with one renewal.Graham said that while the president had not committed to the deal proposal, it was the ìoutline of a potential breakthrough.î He said Trump was ìopen-mindedî about ìcombining wall funding with other things.îGraham also said that Trump wanted to destroy the so-called Islamic State, or ISIS, before pulling U.S. troops out of Syria: ìWeíre inside the 10-yard-line.îJoel B.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/12/30/dem-sen-tester-on-the-border-wall-trump-wants-to-use-the-american-taxpayer-like-an-atm-machine/,"Sunday on CBSís ìFace the Nation,î Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) said President Donald Trump wants ìto use the American taxpayer like an ATM machineî to pay for a†wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.Partial† transcript as follows:BRENNAN: Your colleague Senator Shelby said negotiations are at an impasse and they need to find out what Democrats want and when. As the Democrat here what can you explain?TESTER: Well first of all, Margaret, I would just say that you know we passed a bill a couple of year- couple of weeks ago to keep- keep the government open. And the House refused to take it up. I think that the fact weíre at a government shutdown is nothing short of ridiculous. I think that Senator Shelby and- and others are- are spot on. We need to sit down and- and pound out a deal. I think that that agreement that the- the Senate passed- in a bipartisan way, a couple weeks ago would have give us the opportunity to come to an agreement. The problem is-is- is that the president has one point three billion dollars from last year for- for border security, actually $21 billion for border security, one point three for the wall that he has spent very, very little of that.BRENNAN: He says needs more.TESTER: Yeah. And he says yet he needs more. Yet thereís no plan to go where the money how the money is going to be spent or any analysis on whatís most effective to secure the border. Bottom line is, Margaret, is that I donít talk to anybody in the Senate that doesnít want secure borders. Itís just how the money is going to be spent. And if the president wants to continue to take a campaign promise that he made, which was to have Mexico pay for a wall and say no the rules have changed now weíre still going to build a wall but weíre going to have the American taxpayer pay for it weíre going to use the American taxpayer like an ATM machine. Thatís not the right direction to go.BRENNAN: The White House says itís Democrats who walked away from the table. You heard Senator Shelby say there there was an offer that he put forward of two and a half billion this year two and a half billion next year. What happened to that?TESTER: Well I think that- that that deal never got passed leadership. But- but what did happen this last year is the president asked for one point six billion dollars in his budget proposal for this next year. The Appropriations Committee, which Senator Shelby chairs, and Senator Leahy is a ranking member of agreed to that in a bipartisan way. Senator Shelby voted for it. Senator McConnell voted for it. The president moved the goalposts and said, no, now I want five billion.BRENNAN: Well and theyíve come down to around two. Why canít Democrats come up from one point three?TESTER: Well I think that thatís negotiations that need to be done between leadership between Senator Shelby, Senator Leahy and others and move forth. But the big thing is is that how is the money going to be spent. Whatís the most effective way to secure that southern border. And thatís really whatís important here. I think we can do it with technology and manpower and much more effectively than- than with a wall.BRENNAN: You heard Senator Shelby say there that he thinks probably youíre going to have to talk about things that Democrats have said they wanted including protections for dreamers. Is that the kind of sweetener that would get Democrats to reconsider?TESTER: Well I think weíve been here before. I was- I was in the room when the president said if- if Congress passes that Iím going to sign it. And then he moved back away from that. And so I think ultimately in the end we do need comprehensive immigration reform, thereís no doubt about that, Margaret. But- but in the end we need to know what the president wants. And hopefully heíll stick to it. When we passed the bipartisan funding to go to the first of February, a couple weeks ago, the president said he was gonna sign it. And then after we passed it he said he wasnít going to sign it. We need some predictability.BRENNAN: The president said, of those two migrant children whoíve died in U.S. custody, that itís Democrats fault. Essentially heís arguing that thereís incentives that are in U.S. law that encourage people to cross and take this really dangerous migration route. How do you respond to that?TESTER: Well I respond to the fact that we need comprehensive immigration reform that needs to be there for a while. I think itís everybodyís fault. This is unacceptable. And- and the bottom line is is that if weíre able to get comprehensive immigration reform done, which is going to require someñBRENNAN: Thatís a big ask.TESTER: Senate leadership and leadership in the White House too. Then I think that we will see things settle down in the southern border in a big, big way.BRENNAN: Is there a cost for Democrats to appear to work with the president?TESTER: No, I think what Democrats need to do is they need to work for the country and make sure that not only the southern border, but the northern border is secure make sure that we have the ability on the borders to be able to screen every vehicle coming across to make sure that drugs donít come into this country. And I think that if weíre able to get a plan to be able to do that, which I donít think is that hard to do, I think Democrats and Republicans can work together to- to make sure that we have a secure border and- and keep this country safe.Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

In the decades Iíve had battles with him here in New York, Donald Trump is not as smart as we give him credit for. What he was reacting to was Rush Limbaugh and many that talk to his base had started saying things that were negative, which is why he panicked about his base. There is a direct correlation between Limbaugh and Ann Coulter and all of them saying youíre not getting anything done, even Tucker Carlson. Now he comes back with the wall, now weíve got migrants marching, he does the move to go to visit the troops in Iraq, and then, again, opens his mouth and jams himself again.îHe added, ìA fish wouldnít get caught if he kept his mouth shut.

In 2011, it was†reported†by the†Hawaii Reporter†that Pelosi had in previous years stayed in a $10,000-a-night suite at the Four Seasons Resort in Kona for her holiday vacation.Pelosi slammed Trump on Twitter during the Christmas holiday, claiming his holding out to get border funding is harming Americans.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/26/primer-what-happens-partial-government-shutdown/,"President Donald Trumpís fight with Senate Democrats over border wall funding partially shut down the government†and left many Americans wondering what happens during a partial government shutdown.Various things transpire when the government shuts down.Government agencies that have not received†funding include the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Interior Department, the State Department, the Agriculture Department, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), among other federal agencies.During a government shutdown, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney runs, issues guidance to each agency to develop its own shutdown plan. In a shutdown, federal agencies must stop all ìnonessentialî work, and all non-employees must stay home until the shutdown ends.The shutdown will end when President Trump signs a spending bill passed by Congress. Former President Bill Clinton experienced the longest government shutdown at 21 days.Essential government services will continue, which include:Some minor government services will close during the partial shutdown. The Agriculture Department will close its state and local farm service centers across the country. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) might slow down loan processing, and approvals and new loan applications may not be considered until after the shutdown.A shutdown also impacts many of the governmentís hundreds of thousands of federal government employees.More than 420,000 federal employees will have to work without pay. Additionally, the government will furlough, or send home without pay, roughly 380,000 federal employees, as the government considers them ìnonessential.î Nonessential employees include:Congress does not have to backpay furloughed employees; however, historically, it has done so.Establishment media publications such as†Politico†and NBC News have attempted to portray the devastation that comes with Trumpís partial shutdown.NBC News reported that in Washington, DC, lights were off at the Korean War Veterans Memorial and that part of the National Christmas Tree was closed following electrical repairs.Politico wrote that the partial shutdown would slow down research at the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.The publication also contended that furloughing nonessential employees would serve as a ìblow to morale.îPrevious government shutdowns have been more painful for some, including Americaís veterans.Former President Barack Obama shut down the government in 2013 and set up barriers so that veterans could not visit the World War II Memorial.In contrast to Obama, the Donald Trump administration announced last week that they will make the government shutdown as ìpainless as possible.î

But fewer employees are expected to remain on the job if the shutdown goes on for a longer period of time.One of the USDA offices that is expected to see the most drastic cuts in staffing during the shutdown is the office of Food and Nutrition Servicesó which oversees the nationís welfare programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Child Nutrition, and†the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).The Food and Nutrition Services office is expected to slim down 95 percent of its operations, leaving only 5 percent of the officeís 1,493 employees on board, according to the USDA document outlining shutdown plans.The officeís websiteó like many other USDA websitesó displayed a message stating that its website would not be updated until the government fully re-opens.ìDue to a lapse in federal funding, this USDA website will not be actively updated. Once funding has been re-established, online operations will continue,î according to a statement displayed on the USDAís Food and Nutrition Services†website.Breitbart News reached out to a Food and Nutrition Services spokesperson for comment to confirm, but received an automated message stating that the employee was ìon furloughî due to the shutdown:Thank you for your message.I am not in the office at this time. I am on furlough without access to email, due to the lapse in federal government funding. †I will return your message as soon as possible once funding has been restored.For information about available government services, visit USA.gov.Even with the decrease in staffing, the USDA notes that all eligible households would receive SNAP benefits for the month of January. According to the latest USDA data on food stamp enrollment,†19,395,894 households are currently enrolled in SNAP.Other welfare assistance programs would still be able to continue at the state and local levels with the funding that is already available, and Child Nutrition Programsó like the school lunch programó are funded through February and will operate as usual.

Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Rep.

They pointed to problems beyond the shutdown, including the plunging stock market and the presidentís firing of the defense secretary. ìThe president wanted the shutdown, but he seems not to know how to get himself out of it.îActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said a counteroffer was presented over the weekend to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Mulvaney would only say the offer was between President Trumpís $5.7 billion request and the $1.3 billion Democrats have offered.ìWe moved off of the five and we hope they move up from their 1.3,î he said Sunday, a day after a senior administration official insisted Congress would have to cave into Trumpís spending demand for the shutdown to end. The comments highlighted Trumpís unpredictable negotiating style.Mulvaney said he was awaiting a response from Schumer, whose office said the parties remained ìvery far apart.îFurther, President Trump told his†over 50 million Twitter followers Monday that he is waiting in the White House for Democrats to make a deal on border security.†ìI am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,î President Trump tweeted. ìAt some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about.

But the Senate refused to vote the legislation forward, shutting down the government.Trump remained at the White House while members of Congress went home for Christmas.ìAt some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about,î Trump wrote. ìCrazy!îHe reminded the United States that Democrats used to support border security but desperately want†to keep him from a political victory.ìIt was only when I made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked, that they turned against it,î he wrote. ìDesperately needed!îThe president also defended his foreign policy decision to get American troops out of Syria.Several hawkish senators continued to criticize Trumpís decision, sparking a response from the president.ìTo those few Senators who think I donít like or appreciate being allied with other countries, they are wrong, I DO,î he wrote. ìWhat I donít like, however, is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States, both in Military Protection and Trade.îHe said that Saudi Arabia had agreed to help Syria rebuild once American troops left.ìSee? Isnít it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country, the U.S., that is 5000 miles away[?]î he asked. ìThanks to Saudi A!îHe explained that he is tired of the United States subsidizing the military of wealthy countries, as allies continue to take advantage of the U.S. on trade.ìGeneral Mattis did not see this as a problem,î he wrote. ìI DO, and it is being fixed!îTrump also griped about the Federal Reserve for sending the stock market in negative territory.ìThe only problem our economy has is the Fed. They donít have a feel for the Market, they donít understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders,î he wrote. ìThe Fed is like a powerful golfer who canít score because he has no touch ñ he canít putt!îThe president usually spends his holiday golfing in Florida at Mar-a-Lago, but he remained in Washington, DC, after the shutdown.First lady Melania Trump was in Florida but is returning to the White House to spend Christmas Day with the president:I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security.

Weíll see what they come back with. Our goal is to get somewhere between 1.6 and 5 billion. I mean, this is so ironic that itís the Democrats, like Schumer, who said that we need strong border security, where Durbin has said that we need to find a bipartisan solution to border security, yet they are not willing to budge, at least at this point, in terms of providing funds for [a] physical barrier in that area. And as we know, illegal crossings have increased over 90 percent in the last two months. And youíve seen the issue with the caravan. Thatís been a huge crisis on the border. And the mere fact is that at this moment if we want to make border security a bipartisan issue, the Democrats need to step up to the plate. Itís up to them to stop the shutdown.î(h/t Grabien)Follow Ian†Hanchett on Twitter†@IanHanchett

Bob Corker (R-TN) said President Donald Trump causing a government shutdown over funding for a wall on the U.S. Mexico border is ìjuvenile.îCorker said, ìThis is a purposely contrived fight over, at the end of the day no matter who wins, our borders are still going to be insecure. I think you know that back in 2013, John Hogan and I crafted a border security amendment that passed with 69 votes in the Senate where Republicans were in the minority. Iím a junior senator from Tennessee, and 69 people voted for $46 billion to secure our border. It was overly prescriptive, and it was overkill, but our borders would have been secure. Not long ago, just a few months ago, the president could have received $25 billion in border security just by dealing with the DREAMers which, by the way, most Republicans want to deal with the DREAMers issue. We had $25 billion that could have been spent on now the government is shut down over what ultimately is going to be $2 billion. This is a made-up fight so that the president can look like heís fighting. Even if he wins, our borders are going to be insecure.îHe continued, ìPart of it is because of what weíre spending the money on. We have all kinds of technology, as you know, that we can use to secure the borders. $46 billion did include 700 miles of fencing, which is important, but there are all kinds of technology that we use in Iraq and Afghanistan to secure our borders. Itís not like going to the about Pentagon and saying we need to buy fighters, stealth fighters and theyíre supersonic and have precision guided missiles but letís use the Wright brothers. Itís not just about the money. Itís about what weíre spending it on. We can secure our borders. We can solve this problem. This is a made-up fight.îHe added, ìThis is something that is unnecessary. Itís a spectacle and, candidly, itís juvenile. The whole thing is juvenile.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/18/shutdown-looms-despite-white-house-retreat-no-border-funding-solution-in-sight/,"About a fourth of the federal government is barreling toward another partial shutdown at the end of this week with no solution for border wall funding in reach, and leaders of the Republican and Democrat parties at a standstill just days away from the deadline.Congress has not taken up a spending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other parts of the government, as President Donald Trump has previously insisted upon $5 billion for his planned border wall along the U.S. border with Mexico and Democrats have refused to budge on the matter. The White House on Tuesday, through Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, signaled a retreat from the presidentís previous position to an as-of-yet-unexpressed willingness to compromise on the border wall funding as she blamed the Senate for the lack of a deal, all while a solution remains elusive.While the White House has scaled back the original demand, the government remains unfunded past Friday with no apparent deal in Congressís or the administrationís grasp yetñand that has opened up a circular firing squad among U.S. leaders over where responsibility lies. The blame game comes as the White House is backing down from President Trumpís original push for $5 billion in border wall funding in this spending bill.Last week, Trump sounded off in a heated Oval Office argument with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosiñthe likely incoming Speaker of the House when Democrats take the majority in January after their midterm election boonsñwith both sides threatening to hold firm over the border wall money.During a rare White House briefing on Tuesday, Sanders put the onus for a lack of a funding deal on Congressñparticularly the Senateñand said the White House is waiting to see whatever can pass the chamber.ìYou know, at this point, the Senate has thrown out a lot of ideas,î Sanders told reporters. ìWeíre disappointed in the fact that theyíve yet to actually vote on something and pass something. So when they do that, weíll make a determination on whether or not weíre going to sign that.îSanders putting the blame for lack of a deal on Congress is literally the exact opposite of what GOP leaders in the Senate have said. Republican Senators driving this process on Capitol Hill have all said they are looking to the White House for guidance, and that they have yet to receive clear answers from the president and his team.ìWe donít know,î Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said when asked what President Trump wants out of this funding battle, per Politico in a report earlier on Tuesday before the White House briefing.ìIf thereís a plan, I think at the moment itís the president and the Democrats trying to figure out what they can agree upon,î Sen. John Thune (R-SD), the number three in Senate GOP leadership, added.While the White House had remained firm through Tuesday morning behind the presidentís commitment to$5 billion for the border wall or nothingñwhich would lead to the partial shutdown at the end of this weekñSanders appeared on Fox News earlier in the day before her afternoon briefing to begin walking the administrationís position back. Sanders said:We will continue to have these conversations with both Senate and House Republicans and Democrats. Our team has been in constant communication. Weíre continuing to do thatñIím not going to negotiate here. But weíve been talking to them even as late asñas recently as this morning. Those conversations continue. The President has been clear about what the parameters are that we he wants to see in the legislationñand we hope Democrats will not play games and will support legislation, frankly, that they have supported in the past. Democrats have voted for legislation that we want to see happen.When pressed by Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer on whether the president would take half of the $5 billion that he wants for the border wall, Sanders replied:We have other ways that we can get to that $5 billion that we will work with Congress if they make sure we get a bill passed that provides not just the funding for the wall but there is a piece of legislation thatís been pushed around that Democrats actually voted [for], 26-5 out of committee, that provides roughly $26 billion in border security including $1.6 billion for the wall. Thatís something we would be able to support as long as we can couple that with other funding resources that help us get to the $5 billion.When asked if the Trump administration is pushing for a more ìcreativeî way to fund the wall, Sanders replied to Hemmer that the administration is, indeed.†Sanders said:Look, weíve been very transparent with both Republicans and Democratsñthe House and the Senateñon what we want to see and we want them to work with us. At the end of the day, we donít want to shut down the governmentñwe want to shut down the border from illegal immigration, from drugs coming into this country, and make sure we know whoís coming and why theyíre coming. Thatís what the president is focused on and heís not going to back down until he gets what he needs to make sure the people of this country are protected.Asked about senators saying that the White House has not been clear, Sanders told Fox News that she sees it differentlyñand† argued that the White House has been clear and in ìconstant contactî with Senate leaders on these mattersñdespite what senators, especially Republicans like Shelby and Thune, have been saying.What happened later on Tuesday, though, that leaves the avenue open for a shutdown as no specific deal has been reached, is that Senate Republicans offered Senate Democrats a different dealñone that Democrats rejected.The Washington Post summarized the quickly rejected deal offer thus:President Trump on Tuesday retreated from his demand for $5 billion to build a border wall, as congressional Republicans maneuvered to avoid a partial government shutdown before funding expires at the end of Friday.But Democrats immediately rejected Republicansí follow-up offer, leaving the two sides still at impasse as hundreds of thousands of federal workers await word on whether they will be sent home without pay just before Christmas.The new border funding offer from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) calls on Congress to pass a $1.6 billion homeland security spending bill that was crafted earlier this year in a bipartisan Senate compromise.Under the offer, Congress would also reprogram $1 billion in unspent funds that Trump could use on his immigration policies. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), who oversees the panel in charge of homeland security funding, said the reprogrammed money would not be able to be used for a physical wall but could be spent on other border security measures.Quickly after the deal was offered, though, both Schumer and Pelosi shot it down:Sen. Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told McConnell Tuesday that Democrats would not accept the deal, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) criticized the plan to reprogram the funds.ìLeader Schumer and I have said that we cannot support the offer they made of a billion-dollar slush fund for the president to implement his very wrong immigration policies,î Pelosi said. ìSo that wonít happen.îBack in the briefing room, and in her Fox News appearance, Sanders attempted to soften the blow of the presidentís border wall cave by presenting a new argumentñthat the administration would be seeking to fund the wall from a variety of other sources than new congressional appropriations. But Sanders has not specified exactly what she means by thisña signal that the administration is angling to frame this retreat as strategic, even if it is not.Sanders said the White House is ìlooking at every avenue available to us possibleî for extra bits of cash for a border wall. She continued:The President has asked every one of his Cabinet Secretaries to look for funding that can be used to protect our borders and give the President the ability to fulfill his constitutional obligation to protect the American people by having a secure border. So weíre looking at the other options. In the meantime, weíll see what the Senate does, and weíll let you know when we have an announcement on that front.When pressed later in the briefing on this so-called ìreprogrammingî of already appropriated funding, something Pelosi argued the administration cannot legally do, Sanders said that there are various ìpots of moneyî around the government that could supplement funding of the border wall.ìI would never use Nancy Pelosi as my source for legal authority on probably anything,î Sanders said. ìBut I would use attorneys that work here at the White House and in agencies ñ that thatís their entire job is determining whether or not something is legal. And weíre looking to those individuals to find out those specific pots of money that can be used for that.îIt remains to be seen exactly what ìpots of moneyî are available, how much cash exactly they could provide, whether it would be legal to use them for a border wall, whether the administration will try to do so, whether the administration would succeed if it tried, and what the fallout would be if the administration went this route.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/17/democrats-funded-wall-under-bush-obama-refuse-same-barrier-to-trump/,"Many House and Senate Democrats voted to fund the same bollard-style fencing constructed by Presidents Bush and Obama that they now oppose under President Trump.Ahead of a government shutdown, Trump is asking the Republican-controlled Congress for $5 billion in funding ó just a fifth of the funding needed ó to build what he continues to call a U.S.-Mexico ìborder wall,î though the barrier is almost identical to the bollard fencing erected by both Bush and Obama.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), along with their Democrat caucuses in the House and Senate, have objected to funding any barriers resembling a wall along the southern border.Many of those same Democrats now opposing the funding of border barriers, once supported the use of fencing at the southern border less than a decade ago.The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized the construction of 700 miles of the same style of bollard fence that Trump is building at the border, was supported by 26 Senate Democrats at the time.†In the House, 64 Democrats joined 219 Republican lawmakers to fund the border fencing.Those Democrats in support of funding the bollard border fencing included:All 54 Senate Democrats, in 2013, voted again to commit funding to secure 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border in the†Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act†which was authored and introduced by Schumer.Though the border legislation never became law, the Democrat-backed plan would have authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to implement ìa Southern Border Fencing Strategy to identify where 700 miles of fencing and technology should be deployed along the Southern border.îAs the New York Times has noted in a series of charts, almost 700 miles of barriers have been constructed at the southern border since 2006 with little-to-no objection from elected Democrats.(Screenshot via the New York Times)The Trump administrationís bollard fencing is more than 10 feet higher than those same fences constructed by the Bush and Obama administrations. Since his inauguration, Trump has replaced portions of existing border fences with this new 30-foot high bollard fence.As these†photographs show, the Calexico, California project was completed in October:Border Patrol officers keep watch before US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen M.

(MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images)This same bollard-style fencing, between 18 to 30 feet high, was used by the Trump administration in June to begin replacing about 14 miles of existing fencing in San Diego, California. Similarly, in El Paso, Texas, the 18-foot bollard fencing is replacing chain link and metal fences.In Santa Teresa, New Mexico, the Trump administration has constructed the 18 to 30-foot tall bollard fencing to replace existing fencing in the region.Photographs captured below show the construction underway in April of this year:US workers are photographed during construction of 32km of the border wall by order of US President Donald Trump on the border between Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua state, Mexico and Santa Teresa, New Mexico state, US, on April 17, 2018.

Mark Meadows (R-NC) told reporters on Monday that he remains willing to stay past Christmas to get President Donald Trumpís requested $5 billion in border wall funding.Meadows told reporters that he does not think Democrats will give into Trumpís demands to give him his requested $5 billion in wall funding.Meadows said†he is ìnot very optimistic that Democrats are going to yield in providing $5billion in Wall funding.îTrump has threatened to shut down the government if Congress does not give him his requested five billion dollars in wall funding in the December spending bill; if the government does not pass a spending bill before December 21, the government will partially shut down.The North Carolina conservative also opposed a potential short-term spending bill that punts the wall funding fight to January, when Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) will likely become the new speaker of the House.ìWhat makes January any better than December 21st? Iím willing to stay here through Christmas to get it done right on behalf of the American people,î Meadows said. ìAnd we continue to punt. This is not to anybodyís surprise.îMeadows continued, suggesting that if the government does shut down after December 21, he does not ìthink it would open back up until those discussions happen in earnest on a bipartisan basisî when Democrats regain control of the House of Representatives.Meadowsí contention mirrored President Trumpís recent thinking, which, according to a Bloomberg report, suggested that Trump will likely not support a one-week- or two-week stop-gap spending bill to avert a partial government shutdown.President Trump tweeted Monday that America can save billions of dollars every year with a wall along the U.S. border.ìAnytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line,î Trump wrote. ìTime for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control!îAnytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/12/15/dem-rep-roybal-allard-republicans-have-the-responsibility-to-keep-government-open/,"During Fridayís Democratic Weekly Address, Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA) said Republicans ìhave the responsibility and the power to keep our government open.îTranscript as Follows:†ìHello. Iím Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard of Californiaís 40th Congressional District, and I serve as the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security.Appropriators understand we have a critical responsibility that transcends politics: to keep our government funded, so it can serve the needs of the American people.Unfortunately, House Republicans and the President have ñ once again ñ walked away from that responsibility. Due to their obstruction and failure to govern, Republicans are driving our nation to the brink of another disastrous government shutdown ñ at a time of great economic uncertainty, and right in the middle of the holiday season.Hereís the bottom line. Republicans still control the House, the Senate,†and the White House. They have the responsibility and the power to keep our government open.But this week, before the eyes of the American people, President Trump declared that heíd be ëproudí to shut down the government, saying ëI will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it downí if he cannot force American taxpayers to spend billions of dollars on an immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.Democrats support a strong homeland security policy, that protects our borders and honors our values as a nation. Yet, the President is proposing squandering $5 billion on this border wall ñ when our nation has so many homeland security vulnerabilities that, if left unaddressed, threaten the safety of the American people.We need funding to hire more law enforcement agents to focus on opioid, gang, trade and child exploitation investigations.We need more funding for the Coast Guardís air and sea fleets, including to pay for the first heavy icebreaker since the 1970s ñ because, as the Arctic ice recedes, Russia, China,†and other countries are winning the race to lay claim to the vast resources of that region.We need thousands of additional customs officers to help intercept illicit drugs and other contraband, almost all of which comes into our country through the ports of entry.And we need to be investing more in first responder grants to better prepare states and localities to prevent and respond to terrorism and disasters of every kind.These critical national security needs cannot be met if we waste $5 billion on an unnecessary and ineffective border wall.On January 3, Members of Congress will take an oath: to support the Constitution and protect the American people. Democrats are ready to honor that oath on Day One.Democrats have presented the President with options to keep the government open. Itís President Trumpís choice to keep government open, or to shut the government down ñ and the American People are waiting for his response.And if Republicans do steer our nation into a Trump Shutdown, we will swiftly pass the remaining appropriations bills with a CR for Homeland Security to re-open the government.On Election Day, the American people spoke, and demanded a government that would work for them.House Democrats are ready and proud to deliver For The People: lowering their health costs, increasing their paychecks, cleaning up corruption, and protecting our national security.Letís get to work.îFollow Ian†Hanchett on Twitter†@IanHanchett

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2018/12/11/nearly-2-in-3-trump-voters-support-government-shutdown-for-border-wall/,"Nearly 2-in-3 supporters of President Trump and Republican voters say they support shutting down the federal government in order to secure full funding for a border wall on the†United States-Mexico border.The latest Marist Poll reveals that 65 percent of Trump supporters and 65 percent of GOP voters say†the president should not compromise on his proposed border wall, even if it means a government shutdown.Among those who call themselves ìstrong Republicans,î nearly eight-in-ten say Trump should shut down the government to secure the border wall funding.A plurality of about 47 percent of Trumpís base, the white working class, say the president should stay strong on the border wall and not compromise, even with the possibility of a government shutdown.Non-college educated white men,†50 percent; white evangelical Christians,†53 percent; and Americans living in rural communities, 51 percent, are the most supportive demographic groups of shutting down the government to secure the $25 billion needed to build the border wall.When asked if building the border wall to stop soaring illegal immigration at the southern border was an ìimmediate priority,î about 67 percent of Trump supporters and 63 percent of Republican voters said yes, the border wall is an immediate priority for the nation.A plurality of the white working class, 42 percent, said the border wall is an immediate priority, as well as 45 percent of non-college educated white men and 42 percent of Americans in rural communities, who said the same.As Breitbart News reported, Trump said on Tuesday he is fully committed to shutting down the federal government if Democrats do not help fund his border wall, although Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he and fellow Democrats would not waver in refusing to fund the wall.Currently, the House version of the Department of Homeland Security funding bill, as†Breitbart News†reported, includes only $5 billion for the border wall but ties the funding to†a†variety of cheap labor giveaways to the big business lobby, the outsourcing industry, and the open borders lobby, including:The House DHS spending bill does not include any additional funding for the Border Patrol to effectively detain illegal aliens without releasing them into the American general public.The bill also does not provide Trump with the funding for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to hire an additional 1,000 ICE agents. Trump has said for more than a year that he wants to increase the number of ICE agents, but the GOP Congress failed to provide the funding.The†continuing rise†of illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico border, researchers say, indicates that Fiscal Year 2019 will see the largest level of illegal immigration into the country in more than a decade.John Binder is a reporter†for Breitbart News.

BREITBART,https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2018/12/11/pelosi-i-told-trump-to-pray-for-biblical-wisdom/,"Tuesday, Minority House Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told reporters that she asked President Donald Trump to pray for ìunderstanding and wisdom.îPelosi said, ìI thought we would open the meeting with a prayer, which I did.îShe continued, ìI told him about King Solomon, when he was to become king of the Jews, he prayed to God, he said, ëHow can I ever follow King David? I need you to give me great understanding and wisdom, Lord.í And after he prayed and prayed and prayed, God came to him and said, ëSolomon, because you did not ask for longevity, great wealth, or vengeance against your enemies, I will give you more wisdom than anyone has ever had.í The wisdom of Solomon.îShe added, ìIt had nothing to do with that. It had everything to do withólet us be prayerful and listen to each other and have an understanding of where people are coming from on all of this. Whatever you think about it, how many times did he mention the word wall? Thatís all he could say. How many times did he mention that? How obsessed he is with the wall. Is it worth shutting down the government and hurting the American people? The economy has uncertainty and people are losing their jobs and the market being in a mood, unpredictably, that again. Services being cut off from people who need them. It is not the right thing to do. It is the wrong thing to do and he shouldnít do it no matter what he thinks of his campaign promise.îFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN
