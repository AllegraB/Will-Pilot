"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/trump-netanyahu-jerusalem-embassy.html","WASHINGTON — In the midst of his campaign, President Trump vowed to bring peace to the Middle East by playing it down the middle between Israel and the Palestinians. “Let me be sort of a neutral guy,” he said. Two years later, any hopes of being the neutral guy are long gone.In a meeting at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel put on display perhaps the closest relationship between leaders of their two countries in the seven decades since Israel declared independence. As for the Palestinians, they are no longer on speaking terms with the president, who is busy cutting their aid.Few if any doubted that Mr. Trump came into office more supportive of Israel than the Palestinians and he trumpeted his pro-Israeli credentials, but any semblance of straddling the line between warring camps has vanished and the notion that he could bring them together appears more distant than ever. Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu lavished praise on each other on Monday, and the president said he might visit Jerusalem in May to preside over the politically potent transfer of the American Embassy to the disputed holy city.Mr. Trump insisted that he still had “a good chance” of forging peace and expressed optimism that the Palestinians were ready to return to discussions. “The Palestinians, I think, are wanting to come back to the table very badly,” he said, despite evidence to the contrary. Then he acknowledged what would happen if he is wrong. “If they don’t, you don’t have peace.”The White House has said it is close to finishing a peace plan that it could release soon. But the conditions hardly seem ripe. The two men who met in the Oval Office on Monday are both fighting off investigations. The president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was leading the effort for him, just lost his top-secret security clearance. And the Palestinians are angry about the embassy.“I can’t see him actually proposing anything,” Oded Revivi, chief foreign affairs envoy for the Yesha Council, which represents West Bank settlers, said of Mr. Trump. The president seems unlikely to come up with a plan more acceptable than those that have been rejected in the past, Mr. Revivi said, and “he doesn’t want to fail where others have failed.”The meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu, their fifth since the president’s inauguration 13 months ago, demonstrated just how close the two have become while the Palestinians remain off at a distance. The two celebrated Mr. Trump’s decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the American Embassy there from Tel Aviv in defiance of much of the rest of the world.Mr. Netanyahu extolled Mr. Trump for the decision, comparing him to three of the most important figures in the history of the Jewish people: King Cyrus of Persia, who 2,500 years ago freed the Jews from exile in Babylon and permitted them to return to Jerusalem; Lord Arthur James Balfour, the British foreign secretary whose declaration in 1917 first paved the way for a Jewish homeland in Palestine; and President Harry S. Truman, who recognized Israel’s existence 11 minutes after it declared independence in 1948.Just as Israelis remember those historical figures, Mr. Netanyahu said, “we remember how a few weeks ago President Donald J. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.”“Mr. President,” he continued, “this will be remembered by our people through the ages. As you just said, others talked about it. You did it.”Unlike Mr. Trump, however, Mr. Netanyahu mentioned the goal of peace with the Palestinians only in passing and focused instead on the topic he always makes his top priority when he visits Washington, namely Iran.He hoped to use the visit to encourage Mr. Trump to tear up President Barack Obama’s agreement with Tehran limiting its nuclear program or renegotiate it to toughen its provisions, particularly with respect to ballistic missiles. He also sought consensus on how to counter Iran’s presence in Syria.“Iran must be stopped,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “That is our common challenge.”He voiced deep skepticism about the prospect of a Palestinian state, recalling how Gaza fell under the control of Hamas after Israel withdrew. “You can bring models, theoretical models, say it will be good if we give them a state,” he told the reporters. “Empirically, it doesn’t work with what we see. When we leave land, terror organizations take it up. Immediately.”Mr. Trump, by contrast, was still more interested in seeking what he has called “the ultimate deal” between Israel and the Palestinians. “We’re working on it very hard,” he said with Mr. Netanyahu at his side in the Oval Office. “Look, it would be a great achievement even from a humanitarian standpoint. What better if we could make peace between Israel and the Palestinians? And I can tell you, we’re working very hard on doing that and I think we have a good chance.”Palestinian leaders, who also claim Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, have given no public indication that they would return to discussions any time soon. In response to the president’s Jerusalem move, they declared that they no longer saw the United States as a neutral broker with the Israelis. Mr. Trump then withheld $65 million in aid for Palestinian refugees.But Mr. Kushner went to the United Nations recently to hear Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, speak in an effort to show respect shortly after the president publicly pressed Israel on settlement construction in the West Bank.The Monday meeting came at a time when both Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu are under increasing domestic pressure from investigations bearing down on them and their families. Shortly before their get-together, Mr. Trump was lashing out at the investigation into whether his team cooperated with Russia during the 2016 election, while reports from Israel indicated that a former confidant of Mr. Netanyahu’s had made a deal with the police in a corruption investigation of the prime minister.“They have an awful lot in common and they both may be desperately in need of a friend and someone who understands what they’re going through,” said Mara Rudman, a former deputy special envoy for Middle East peace under Mr. Obama. “And they happen to be showing it for the world to see.”Mr. Netanyahu later said their mutual woes — they both use the phrase “witch hunt” to describe the inquiries into their activities — never came up during their meeting. Instead, they relished the chance to showcase their partnership during the part of their session when cameras were on.“The relationship has never been better,” Mr. Trump declared.“It’s never been stronger,” Mr. Netanyahu agreed.Mr. Trump has made his decision to move the embassy a selling point among his supporters, lauding it during a recent speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference as one of his major achievements. His administration announced that it would formally open the Jerusalem embassy in May to coincide with the 70th anniversary of Israel’s independence by redesignating an existing consular facility.The president said on Monday that he may attend. “We’re looking at coming,” Mr. Trump said. “If I can, I will.”As he has before, Mr. Trump argued that his decision to recognize Jerusalem resolved a tough issue dividing Israel and the Palestinians. “We’ve taken it off the table,” he said. “So this gives us a real opportunity for peace.”Hardly any veterans of Middle East peacemaking, including some who support moving the embassy, share this view. Mr. Trump’s unilateral declaration does not mean that the Palestinians have given up on Jerusalem; instead, they have dug in. Many former negotiators have envisioned a peace deal in which both sides operate their capitals out of Jerusalem, the Israelis in the west and the Palestinians in the east.As he often does, Mr. Trump boasted that he had already cut the cost of building a new embassy, but he seemed to be conflating two different expenses. “They put an order in front of my desk last week for a billion dollars,” he said. “I said a billion? What’s that for? They said, ‘We’re going to build an embassy.’ I said we’re not going to spend a billion dollars. We’re actually doing it for about $250,000.”The State Department has estimated that construction of a new embassy will cost about $500 million. Mr. Trump’s reference to $250,000 presumably is the cost of making minor adjustments to the existing consular facility so that it can house an office for the American ambassador and be formally redesignated an embassy while a new facility is constructed.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum-nafta.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump, facing an angry chorus of protests from leaders of his own party, including the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, insisted on Monday that he would not back down from his plan to impose across-the-board tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But the White House was devising ways to potentially soften the impact of the measures on major trading partners.The intense maneuvering, which began before Mr. Trump’s unexpected announcement of the tariffs last Thursday, is likely to delay any formal rollout of the measures until next week, according to several officials who have been briefed on the deliberations.On Monday, Mr. Ryan, the most powerful Republican in the House, broke with the president, declaring through a spokeswoman, “We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan.” The tariffs, Mr. Ryan’s spokeswoman said, would “jeopardize” the economic gains from the recent Republican tax cuts.Mr. Trump appeared little moved by the pushback. One of his all-important barometers — the stock market — rebounded on Monday after falling sharply immediately after the announcement of the tariffs last week as the Republican dissent fueled optimism that Mr. Trump would ultimately reverse course. Opponents of tariffs, including many economists, warn they could damage economic growth by igniting a ruinous trade war, a prospect that Mr. Trump has alternately welcomed or dismissed as unlikely.But a person close to the White House said that the president was itching to impose tariffs, and that Monday’s stock market rebound had reassured Mr. Trump that he was in the right.“We’re not backing down,” the president said at the White House on Monday, as he reeled off a familiar litany about trade deals that he said had driven out factories and deprived American workers of jobs.But Mr. Trump did open the door to a compromise, at least with Canada and Mexico, which are in negotiations with the United States to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. If the two countries agree to a “new & fair” Nafta, they could be exempt from the tariffs, Mr. Trump said in a tweet on Monday morning.The debate over tariffs has become a litmus test for Mr. Trump, putting his longstanding suspicion of free trade up against the equally fervent support for it among Republicans and members of his own administration.Inside the White House, the debate has pitted hard-liners like Peter Navarro, the president’s trade adviser, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross against more pro-trade voices, like Mr. Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, who argue that the measure could disrupt international alliances and global supply chains.Republican lawmakers have criticized tariffs as undercutting the $1.5 trillion tax cut that they worked in lock step to pass last year, saying tariffs are essentially a tax increase that would slow economic growth. On Monday, they floated the idea of congressional action to try to block tariffs, should the president impose them.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, circulated a letter Monday expressing concern over the tariffs. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said he spent the weekend speaking with members of Congress and “senior administration officials” about his opposition to the president’s plan.“As you know the administration is split itself,” Mr. Sullivan said from the annual CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, noting that details of the tariffs remain sparse.Mr. Trump has heard all sides’ arguments, but his view has remained steadfast, one White House official said.Still, the official said, the president is mindful enough of the arguments against potentially tanking the stock market that he has been somewhat open to a move to narrow the scope and effects of the tariffs while avoiding the perception that he was relenting. That would echo the approach the administration took to winding down the president’s promises on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which has protected young immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children.The unsettled nature of a final policy was magnified by a conversation on Sunday between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain.Ms. May, a person briefed on the call said, warned Mr. Trump how dangerous the tariffs would be. Mr. Trump disagreed, but concluded the conversation by telling Ms. May that he had not made a final decision on what to do.The president originally announced that he wanted to put new tariffs into effect this week, but a legal review has not been concluded. On Sunday, Mr. Navarro said the tariff announcement could come this week or the following week at the latest. He also reaffirmed that companies might be able to seek exemptions for certain foreign products they need for their business, a process likely to lead to months of furious lobbying.A coalition of 25 industry associations representing farmers and companies that use steel and aluminum has started lobbying the administration and lawmakers, arguing that the tariffs are far broader than necessary and would create higher prices on American companies that buy and use metals.The president and his advisers have repeatedly maintained that any tariffs will be imposed on imports from all countries without exception. The Commerce Department has concluded that imports of steel and aluminum pose a threat to national security, a determination that gives the president broad authority under United States law to impose tariffs.But that legal standing will undoubtedly be challenged by other countries and companies, both in court and at the World Trade Organization, which requires that members treat all other members equally on trade. Creating exceptions for countries like Canada and Mexico for non-national security reasons like Nafta could invite challenges at the World Trade Organization, said Jennifer Hillman, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center.“Unequivocally, I think there will be cases filed at the W.T.O., and there is plenty of ground to challenge this,” Ms. Hillman said.On Monday, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said Mr. Trump decided to link a tariff exemption to a revised Nafta deal “a couple of days ago” as Mr. Lighthizer prepared to travel to Mexico City to meet with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts.“It makes sense, since this is a major irritant, to have it be considered,” Mr. Lighthizer said in Mexico City after meeting with Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo of Mexico and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland of Canada. He said the situation could be modified for Mexico and Canada given a successful Nafta renegotiation, as well as “perhaps other countries in other contexts where we have those kinds of problems.”Even if Canada and Mexico were exempted from the tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, officials said the United States would impose a quota on those countries’ exports to prevent them from being used as a conduit for metals shipments from other nations.Neither Canada nor Mexico appeared mollified by the prospect of a tariff exemption in exchange for bending to United States demands on Nafta. Ms. Freeland reiterated comments that any action that ensnared Canada would be “completely unacceptable.”“México shouldn’t be included in steel & aluminum tariffs,” Mr. Guajardo said in a tweet. “It’s the wrong way to incentivize the creation of a new & modern #NAFTA.”Michael Camuñez, a former Commerce Department official who advises international firms doing business in Mexico, called the proposed tariffs and the tweet a “terrible development” for the Nafta negotiations “because all parties have indicated that they will not negotiate with a gun against their head.”The talks in Mexico City produced no meaningful progress, and ultimately would be decided by one man — Mr. Trump, Mr. Camuñez said. Negotiators have continued to clash over provisions in the pact, including rules for auto manufacturing, and the United States has continued to insist on changes that its trading partners say are nonstarters.Mr. Camuñez said Mexico and Canada would retaliate “with good reason” if the steel and aluminum tariffs were imposed, an outcome that could lead to a breakdown in negotiations. “That would escalate tensions and that could lead the president to conclude that these negotiations aren’t going anywhere and blame the Mexicans and the Canadians,” Mr. Camuñez said.Mr. Trump has threatened additional retaliation if other nations erect their own trade barriers, saying in a tweet over the weekend that the United States would make it harder for the European Union to sell cars in the country if it imposes tariffs on American imports.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/trade-deficit-tariffs-economists-trump.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s fixation  with America’s widening trade deficit is fueling his decision to impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Only a small group of experts share Mr. Trump’s fixation, and few see tariffs as an effective tool to narrow the so-called trade gap.America’s trade deficit is the gap between how much in goods and services it imports from foreign countries, and how much it exports. Mr. Trump complains about the metric frequently, saying the trade imbalance is a measure of America’s weakness on trade policy.“We lost, over the last number of years, $800 billion a year,” he said in the White House on Monday, while defending his tariffs against criticism from Republican leaders in Congress. “Not a half a million dollars, not 12 cents. We lost $800 billion a year on trade.” He went on to say that the country “lost $500 billion” a year to China, though it was not clear what figure he was citing, given that America’s annual trade deficit with China has never climbed beyond $375 billion.Most economists do not see the trade gap as money “lost” to other countries, nor do they worry about trade deficits to a large degree. That’s because trade imbalances are affected by a host of macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. For instance, America’s trade deficit narrowed dramatically during the Great Recession, when national consumption faltered.Mr. Trump has long argued that the trade deficit hinders economic growth, and that reducing it will accelerate American job creation. Even those who agree with that view say there are better ways to reduce the imbalance than through tariffs, which can backfire and further widen the trade deficit if other countries impose reciprocal tariffs.“If you look across countries, there’s no evidence that high tariffs reduce your trade deficit,” said Joseph E. Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and a co-author of a 2017 book of policy recommendations on how to reduce trade imbalances.“The trade deficit is a terrible metric for judging economic policy,” said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist and former chairman of President Barack Obama’s National Economic Council. Mr. Summers said tariffs would actually worsen deficits by making American companies that ship steel and aluminum overseas less competitive, and by inviting foreign retaliatory tariffs against other exports.A year ago, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing the Commerce Department and the United States trade representative to conduct a 90-day review on the causes of America’s persistent trade deficits. That review has not yet been released. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported last month that the trade deficit grew to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2017, up from 2.7 percent the year before.The deficit in goods alone with China grew to $375 billion last year, an 8 percent increase from 2016.The deficit in goods and services is on pace to reach about $330 billion, depending on fourth-quarter data that has not yet been reported, which would also be an increase from the year before.The tangible source of America’s persistent trade deficit with China is consumer goods: electronics, housewares and so much else that Americans buy regularly at Walmart or Costco. Those deficits have been exacerbated, economists generally agree, through concerted action by the Chinese government to prop up exports, by holding down the value of China’s currency and directly subsidizing some exporting industries.When it was admitted to the World Trade Organization in 2001, China got access to markets around the world and in turn committed to opening its own markets to countries such as the United States, said Eswar S. Prasad, a trade economist at Cornell University. “China did not keep up its end of the bargain,” Mr. Prasad said. “It did not provide easy access to its own markets. And for a long period after the Asian financial crisis — 2000 until the end of that decade — they gave themselves a competitive advantage by holding down the value of their currency.”The United States actually runs a trade surplus in services with China, as it does with many other countries, in part by attracting Chinese students to study at American colleges, which counts as an export.Mr. Prasad and most other trade experts say bilateral trade deficits are not a good measure of whether countries are living up to their promises on market access, or whether certain countries are better negotiators of trade agreements. They compare the global economy to a neighborhood. Consumers might spend a lot of money with a shopkeeper who never buys anything from their store in return, but they also receive money from other customers whose stores they never frequent.“A bilateral balance doesn’t really tell you anything about what the economy is doing,” said Scott Lincicome, an adjunct fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, “just like my bilateral deficit with my grocery store doesn’t tell you anything about whether I’m in debt.”Mr. Trump’s own Council of Economic Advisers, in a report last month, seemed to play down alarms over bilateral trade deficits. “The United States has a bilateral goods deficit and a services surplus with many of its major trading partners,” council members wrote. “Overall, the United States has a goods deficit and a services surplus with the world. The services surplus is consistent with the structure of the private sector, which has evolved during the last few decades toward more services output as a share of G.D.P.”Economists who share Mr. Trump’s concern with the overall trade deficit, or at least some degree of it, say there are better ways than tariffs to reduce it. Dean Baker, a liberal economist who writes frequently on trade policy, said targeting currency values is the best route; if other countries’ currencies strengthen relative to the dollar, it becomes more attractive for their consumers to buy American exports.Mr. Gagnon has a list of recommendations but said one dwarfs all others: reducing America’s growing federal budget deficit, which is fueling foreign investment in the United States as the government turns to other nations to finance its spending.“There are things we could do,” he said, “but I hate to recommend them when we’re not doing the most important thing, which is bring down our massive fiscal deficit.”Mr. Trump, he noted, recently signed  sweeping tax cuts that will add an estimated $1 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years, even after accounting for the faster growth it could bring.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/trump-trade-tariffs-nafta.html","WASHINGTON — Paul D. Ryan, the Republican House speaker, criticized President Trump’s proposed steel and aluminum tariffs on Monday, saying they could lead to a damaging trade war.“We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan,” a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan said in a statement. “The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don’t want to jeopardize those gains.”The statement was a dramatic departure for Mr. Ryan, a top leader in Mr. Trump’s own party, who worked in lockstep with the president to pass a $1.5 trillion tax cut last year. While other Republican lawmakers have come out against the president’s trade action, this was Mr. Ryan’s first public comment since Mr. Trump announced last week that he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.Mr. Trump has shown no sign that he plans to retreat from the trade action. On Monday, he used the tariffs to threaten two of the United States’ closest trading partners, saying in a tweet that the tariffs would only “come off” of Canada and Mexico if a new and “fair” multilateral trade pact was signed.The statement continued Mr. Trump’s running Twitter defense of the tariffs, which he has positioned as necessary to help the United States protect itself against foreign competitors. But his administration continues to sow confusion over the breadth, scope and legality of the tariffs on steel and aluminum that Mr. Trump announced last Thursday. The White House has said those tariffs would apply to imports from all countries with no exemptions.Mr. Trump’s tweet came as the United States, Mexico and Canada are wrapping up the seventh round of talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement in Mexico City. Negotiators have continued to clash over provisions in the pact, including rules for auto manufacturing, and the United States has continued to insist on changes that its trading partners say are nonstarters.“We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada,” the president tweeted Monday. “NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U.S.A.”Opening up exceptions for countries like Canada and Mexico for other factors like Nafta could also invite more challenges at the World Trade Organization, said Jennifer Hillman, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. That body requires that members treat all other members equally when it comes to trade. “Unequivocally, I think there will be cases filed at the WTO, and there is plenty of ground to challenge this,” Ms. Hillman said.On Sunday, two of the president’s top trade advisers defended the tariff plan but left room for the president to change his mind. Peter Navarro, the head of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, said the tariff announcement could come this week or the following week at the latest. Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, acknowledged that the president could change his mind, while adding that he had no reason to do so.The president’s announcement was cheered by steel and aluminum companies but rattled stock markets, allies and industries that purchase metal to make their products, who could see their prices rise as a result. The European Union, Canada and other countries have already threated retaliation on American products and cases against the United States at the W.T.O. Mr. Trump has threatened additional retaliation in response, saying in a tweet over the weekend that the United States would make it harder for the European Union to sell cars here if it erects trade barriers on American imports.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/politics/trump-white-house-chaos.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump pushed back on Tuesday against reports that his White House is in chaos, following the resignations of senior staff members and as the special counsel’s investigation into Russian election meddling inched closer to his inner circle.In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump said “people will always come & go.” He added, “There is no Chaos, only great Energy!”It was an odd defense for a man who has thrived on chaos and has used it as a way to both organize people and manage them.In his tweet, Mr. Trump suggested more resignations may be coming: “I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection).”The New York Times and others reported on the cascading chaos of last week, with the announcement of the resignation of one of his longest-serving aides, Hope Hicks, and the threat of another staff resignation after Mr. Trump announced a new trade policy against the advice of one of his top economic advisers, Gary D. Cohn.Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, had his security clearance downgraded, significantly limiting his access to some of the most serious national security issues the president faces. The White House also pushed back on rumors that Mr. Trump planned to fire his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, resigned early last year and is cooperating with the special counsel in its ongoing investigation.The president’s tweet about chaos was one of several on a range of topics, including immigration policy and the prospects of a denuclearized North Korea. Mr. Trump was also critical of the Oscars record-low ratings. He said, “Problem is, we don’t have Stars anymore — except your President (just kidding, of course)!”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/upshot/texas-primary-democrats-voter-enthusiasm-turnout.html","The 2018 elections formally begin with the Texas primary on Tuesday, and early voting tallies are already being interpreted as yet another sign of Democratic strength heading into the midterms.It’s not without reason. In early voting, Democratic primary voters outnumbered Republicans in Texas by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent. The number of Democratic early voters, presumably motivated in part by distaste for President Trump, more than doubled compared with 2014.The surging Democratic tallies are even viewed by some as a sign that Texas may emerge as a fairly competitive state in the midterm elections.Is that a reasonable conclusion? Looking back at primary elections since 2004, there’s some reason to think so. Without obvious extenuating circumstances (like a high-profile presidential primary for one party but not the other), primary performance can be cautiously interpreted as a harbinger of the general election.In terms of this year’s midterm elections, there are two ways to look at the primaries: at the national level; and by state and district. Over all, the national primary vote is a rough if imperfect indicator of the national political environment. The primary vote by state and district is an equally rough, though potentially more analytically useful, measure of partisanship.NationallyPerhaps the most straightforward way to judge whether primary results can foreshadow the general election is to compare the primary vote of the average congressional district with the eventual average congressional district result in the midterm election.This seems to do a decent job of prediction, based on limited data going back to 2004, using vote history data from L2, a nonpartisan vendor of voter files. The two notable exceptions — 2004 and 2012 — are fairly easily dismissed, since only one party had a presidential primary in those years. However, there just aren’t many data points, so caution is warranted.In a way, primaries resemble special elections. Nonpresidential primaries are relatively low-turnout affairs that provide a clue about which side’s base is more engaged. That’s extremely important in midterm elections.But there are differences, too: Primary turnout is less volatile than in special elections, which often have ultralow voter participation. Primaries occur in almost every jurisdiction in the country, while special elections (particularly if analyzed without adjusting for population) are often deeply unrepresentative. And primaries are partisan ballots, not contests between two candidates of different parties, so you can interpret their results as a more direct proxy for partisanship preference.State and DistrictThe national primary vote might be somewhat predictive of the national House vote, but it isn’t nearly so simple to make a similar prediction by state or district.How could that be? In most states, voters are confined to one party in the primary but may vote for whoever they like in the general. So the primary vote is an imperfect measure of partisan preference, not a measure of how voters feel about a particular race.But that doesn’t mean it’s useless. Presidential vote choice, the most common indicator of a district’s partisanship, is also a deeply imperfect measure, so there’s value in adding the primaries to the mix.There are places like West Virginia, where Republicans dominate in presidential elections but where the right kind of Democrat can take advantage of the state’s latent Democratic tradition. Conor Lamb might be doing so in the special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th District, which adjoins West Virginia and still has a Democratic registration advantage. And there are places like Orange County, Calif., or the suburbs of Dallas and Atlanta where one could wonder whether a strongly Republican tradition will cut against Democratic chances in places where Mr. Trump struggled.The primary vote is another good measure of the partisan makeup of a state.Take one of this year’s first primary states: Illinois. Based on recent presidential election results, it might appear that a Republican incumbent, Mike Bost, should be well positioned to hold a district that Mr. Trump won by 15 points. But this district has a strong Democratic tradition; Senator Tammy Duckworth actually carried Mr. Bost’s district by more than a 10-point margin against an incumbent Republican last November.Primary votes there reveal the district’s Democratic tradition: Even in 2016, Democratic primary voters outnumbered Republicans in the presidential primary. This suggests that Mr. Bost might be much more vulnerable than the typical Republican in a district that voted for Mr. Trump by so much.It’s possible that Mr. Trump’s presidency has realigned partisanship along the lines of the 2016 presidential election, and that Mr. Bost, for example, will be fairly safe in his district. If true, the primaries will be one of our first clues.Democrats might see a big surge in primary turnout in well-educated, traditionally Republican areas, like the suburbs of Dallas or Houston. In 2016, the primary vote there was 2-to-1 in favor of the Republicans.The primary vote does a decent job of anticipating this kind of change in partisan allegiance. Democratic primary strength has steadily eroded in many Southern states where the party was once strong in down-ballot races, for instance.But that doesn’t mean you can just take primary results at face value. In Indiana, the 2008 Democratic primary yielded a spike in Democratic turnout that presaged a Democratic surge in the general. But the Republicans didn’t have a competitive presidential primary at all — so you couldn’t look at the overall primary vote breakdown and conclude that the state was now solidly Democratic.The competitive Democratic primary in the 2010 Arkansas Senate race probably kept the state’s primary vote from trending toward the Republicans in that year, even as politically similar Tennessee broke hard toward the Republicans.The lesson is that it’s difficult to read too much into the result of a single primary. It may be more useful to look at multiple years of data, in part because there are unique circumstances in individual primaries, like whether one party had a high-profile contest to generate national media coverage. It’s also important to consider the circumstances in each state, such as whether the primary contest is open or closed. But if you can account for this, there’s useful information.In Texas, Republicans are counting on the state’s G.O.P. tradition to insulate them from Mr. Trump’s unpopularity. That’s especially true in well-educated, suburban districts like Texas’ Seventh or 32nd District, where Mr. Trump lost but Republicans traditionally have a 2-to-1 edge in the primary vote. In theory, that kind of Republican tradition should be a meaningful drag on Democratic chances compared with the typical area where Mr. Trump was defeated.A strong Democratic showing in a partisan primary in Texas would indicate that Republicans can’t count on vestigial partisan strength to insulate them from Mr. Trump’s distinct weakness among college-educated voters.Alone, a Democratic primary ballot victory won’t make the Democrats favorites in any of Texas’ Republican-held congressional districts, let alone statewide. But it would suggest that Republicans should not be optimistic about their chances to survive a wave election in Texas, and in well-educated, traditionally Republican suburbs elsewhere across the country.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/business/media/paul-schweizer-google-facebook.html","Conservatives are zeroing in on a new enemy in the political culture wars: Big Tech.Arguing that Silicon Valley is stifling their speech and suppressing right-wing content, publishers and provocateurs on the right are eyeing a public-relations battle against online giants like Google and Facebook, the same platforms they once relied on to build a national movement.In a sign of escalation, Peter Schweizer, a right-wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton, plans to release a new film focusing on technology companies and their role in filtering the news.Tentatively titled “The Creepy Line,” Mr. Schweizer’s documentary is expected to have its first screening in May in Cannes, France — during the Cannes Film Festival, but not as part of the official competition. He used the same rollout two years ago for his previous film, an adaptation of his book “Clinton Cash” that he produced with Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News.”The Creepy Line” alludes to an infamous 2010 speech by Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google at the time, who dismissed concerns about privacy by declaring that his company’s policy was “to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it.”The documentary, which has not been previously reported, dovetails with concerns raised in recent weeks by right-wing groups about censorship on digital media — a new front in a rapidly evolving culture war.If the mainstream media is a perennial enemy of the right, Big Tech is a fresh and novel foe, arguably more relevant to 2018. Facebook, Google and their ilk are facing tough questions about their inability to police the content they distribute, including Russian propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. The companies have also been accused by lawmakers, critics and activists of monopolistic tendencies and manipulative product design.The critique from conservatives, in contrast, casts the big tech companies as censorious and oppressive, all too eager to stifle right-wing content in an effort to mollify liberal critics.“This could end up being the free speech issue of our time,” said Alex Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart News, which has published articles accusing Google and Facebook of, among other sins, political bias. “The Silicon Valley elites are saying: ‘We don’t care what you want to see — we know what you should see. We know better.’”Big Tech is easily associated with West Coast liberalism and Democratic politics, making it a fertile target for the right. And operational opacity at Facebook, Google and Twitter, which are reluctant to reveal details about their algorithms and internal policies, can leave them vulnerable, too.“It’s the perfect foil,” said Eli Pariser, a former executive director of the liberal activist group MoveOn.org and the author of “The Filter Bubble,” a book about how consumers find information online. “There’s not even a real basis to establish objective research about what’s happening on Facebook, because it’s closed.”Google, Facebook and Twitter loomed large at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., where dozens of guests squeezed into a standing-room-only ballroom for a discussion called “Suppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.”Among the panelists were James O’Keefe, the guerrilla filmmaker who has tried to undermine news outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN, and James Damore, an engineer fired by Google after he circulated a memo arguing that biological differences accounted for the low number of women in engineering.Mr. Damore — a new celebrity in the right-wing world, who, in an interview, said of his first foray to CPAC, “There’s definitely a lot of people that want to take selfies” — described a culture of dogmatic liberalism at Google.“There are political activists in all of these companies that want to actively push a liberal agenda,” he said. “Why does it matter? Because these companies are so ubiquitous and powerful that they are controlling all the means of mass communication.”Before Mr. Damore spoke, organizers distributed baseball caps to guests emblazoned with an illustration of Twitter’s bird logo, upside-down and with its eyes crossed out.The panelists accused social media platforms of delisting their videos or stripping them of advertising. Such charges have long been staples of far-right online discourse, especially among YouTubers, but Mr. Schweizer’s project is poised to bring such arguments to a new — and potentially larger — audience.Mr. Schweizer, 53, was a speechwriting consultant to President George W. Bush. His reporting has been cited by The Times and “60 Minutes,” although he often uses a bombastic style akin to that of Breitbart News.He is also the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit organization. He and Mr. Bannon founded it with funding from the family of Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund manager and donor to Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign.Mr. Schweizer declined to identify the film’s financial backers. A spokeswoman for the institute said it was not involved in the project.In some ways, the complaints from the right about Big Tech mirror the grumblings of legacy news organizations, which have expressed concern that online algorithms wield too much power over how readers gain access to their content.Jeffrey A. Zucker, the president of CNN, derided Google and Facebook as “monopolies” and called for regulators to step in during a speech in Spain last month, saying the tech hegemony is “the biggest issue facing the growth of journalism in the years ahead.” And former President Barack Obama said at an off-the-record conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last month that he worried Americans were living in “entirely different realities” and that large tech companies like Facebook were “not just an invisible platform, they’re shaping our culture in powerful ways.” The contents of the speech were published by Reason magazine.In the right’s more internet-savvy quarters, tech platforms have been a regular — and fruitful — subject of discussion since before the 2016 election. In May that year, Facebook was forced to respond to claims that the curators of its Trending Topics feature had suppressed conservative news sources, a controversy that called attention to Facebook’s editorial power.That charge of editorial bias was echoed last weekend by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, who accused YouTube of planning to delete his organization’s account, a claim that was widely shared among conservatives.YouTube did delete some videos that accused teenage survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting of being “crisis actors,” and it issued “strikes,” or warnings, to the accounts of Infowars and Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and Infowars contributor. (YouTube denied that it had plans to delete the Infowars account.)Facebook has also caught flak for adjusting  the algorithm for its News Feed to emphasize posts from “friends, family and groups” over content from public pages. The change was part of an effort by the company to answer criticism, but also to reinvigorate its oldest and most profitable product, which recently recorded a decline in American daily users for the first time in its history.The Facebook adjustment has affected virtually every media organization that is partly dependent on the platform for audiences, but it appears to have hit some harder than others. They include right-wing sites like Gateway Pundit and the millennial-focused Independent Journal Review, which was forced to lay off staff members last month.The social news giant BuzzFeed recently bought ads on Facebook with the message, “Facebook is taking the news out of your News Feed, but we’ve got you covered,” directing users to download its app. Away from the political scrum, the viral lifestyle site LittleThings, once a top publisher on the platform, announced last week that it would cease operations, blaming “a full-on catastrophic update” to Facebook’s revised algorithms.Right-wing media has pounced. In late February, citing statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip, Breitbart published an article on the effects on the president’s Facebook page with the headline “EXCLUSIVE: Trump’s Facebook Engagement Declined By 45 Percent Following Algorithm Change.” The drop, the article insinuated, occurred “following a year of pressure from left-wing employees and the mainstream media for ‘allowing’ the president to win the 2016 general election.”Still, the brewing backlash did not stop Google and Facebook from courting the very crowd that now seems ready to declare them enemies. Both companies were sponsors at this year’s CPAC, leading to a few awkward moments.Facebook, which sponsored a “help desk” for attendees featuring smiling representatives and cookies frosted with emoji icons, provided a demonstration of its virtual reality program, Oculus. But the company was forced to apologize for including a first-person shooter simulation, given that the conference took place a week after the Parkland massacre.Google, which has co-sponsored CPAC three of the past six years, held a lavish reception for attendees featuring an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.Mr. Marlow, the editor of Breitbart, was asked in an interview what he thought about Google’s giving a party in the midst of a crowd that is gunning for it.“The least they can do,” Mr. Marlow said, “is buy us a drink.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/politics/bryant-neal-vinas-terrorism-cooperation-fbi-witness-protection.html","Bryant Neal Vinas, a convicted terrorist from Long Island, showed up recently for dinner at Katz’s Delicatessen on the Lower East Side in oversize glasses with black rims, a thin attempt to alter his appearance.After he was released from federal prison last year, Mr. Vinas assumed he would have no need for a disguise. He thought he was going into witness protection, with a home far away and a new identity, after he helped the American government battle Al Qaeda as one of the most important cooperators in the government’s fight against terrorism.Captured in 2008 after training for months at Qaeda camps, Mr. Vinas quickly turned on his fellow jihadists and began helping American investigators dismantle the group. Even the federal judge who sentenced him described his cooperation as “remarkable.”“I helped them kill my friends,” Mr. Vinas explained while eating pastrami on a hoagie roll with mayonnaise, his choice of condiment drawing a weird look from his lawyer and the waiter. He added, “If that doesn’t show how you’re willing to turn your life around, I don’t know what will.”But the government decided against giving him protection, and Mr. Vinas, 35, has found himself unexpectedly back in New York, where he was raised and converted to Islam more than a decade ago. The F.B.I. and the Justice Department declined to comment, but a senior government official said there were concerns about whether Mr. Vinas would adapt to the program and potential conflicts with law enforcement officials who administer the witness protection program.Nonetheless, the decision could affect future government cases as defense lawyers weigh whether to help prosecutors. The F.B.I. and federal prosecutors have long relied on informants to build cases against mob bosses, crooked Wall Street traders and drug dealers, and current and former law enforcement officials questioned whether potential cooperators would decline to help the government without a guarantee of safety in return.“How often do you get an American who went into Al Qaeda?” asked Jack Cloonan, a former F.B.I. agent who investigated the group. “I would think you would want to do everything you could for him. If I were the agent, I would be hard-pressed to accept this.”In a series of interviews, his first since being freed, Mr. Vinas gave an unusually revealing look at life inside Al Qaeda. He spoke of a training camp, where he slept in flea-ridden sleeping bags but befriended other young men from around the world, and gained access to Qaeda leaders, who discussed with him the most effective ways to cause mass destruction inside the United States. He suggested blowing up the Long Island Rail Road, or a Walmart.Mr. Vinas became interested in Islam before the Sept. 11 attacks after meeting a Muslim woman at a mall. He converted in 2004 at a mosque in Queens, did odd jobs in New York and eventually fell under the spell of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric and Qaeda recruiter in Yemen whose YouTube videos were popular among Islamic extremists.Mr. Vinas had few prospects and even less money, and had grown distant from his family. As the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq dragged on, he grew to hate American foreign policy and thought he had a moral and religious obligation to defend Muslims.Fighting in Afghanistan, he thought, would give him a purpose.“If I had had a future, it would have been different,” he said.He traveled to Lahore, Pakistan, in 2007 and eventually linked up with militants who provided training and took him to Afghanistan. Six months later, Mr. Vinas was living at a safe house in Waziristan, a tribal area in northwest Pakistan, with Qaeda recruits from Egypt, Kuwait, Turkey and Saudi Arabia.By March 2008, Mr. Vinas had begun basic training at a Qaeda camp in northwest Pakistan. The living arrangements were primitive; trainees had to share the flea-infested sleeping bags. The food — rice, potato stew and boiled roots — gave him diarrhea and dysentery.He met many Qaeda leaders, including Saleh al-Somali, the chief of external operations, who planned an attack on New York’s subways that the F.B.I. thwarted.In a conversation with Younis al-Mauritani, a senior Qaeda member, Mr. Vinas suggested bombing the Long Island Rail Road as a way to hurt the New York economy.“It was just an idea that was talked about,” Mr. Vinas recalled. He also advised attacking a Walmart, but the idea was dismissed.Mr. Vinas made friends easily, like a Pakistani who had lived in Texas and loved barbecue and the Grateful Dead. Mr. Vinas’s closest friend was a gregarious 6-foot-5, 300-pound Kuwaiti who enjoyed American fast food and spoke excellent English.Mr. Vinas said his friend wanted to be a suicide bomber because it was “one click to paradise.” But Al Qaeda instead made him work on its newsletter.As much as Al Qaeda hated the West, he said, the group’s fighters enjoyed its exports, like Pepsi and Danish yogurt. He said Mr. Somali raved about McDonald’s and Hardee’s.Many of the people he met died in drone strikes.The Pakistani authorities arrested Mr. Vinas in October 2008 in the Hayatabad neighborhood of Peshawar, where he had traveled to find a wife. The Pakistanis interrogated him, he said, and notified the American government that he had been caught. Mr. Vinas recalled thinking that he would be sent to the United States military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.Instead, he was flown to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and then to New York to be prosecuted. “It was a long trip,” Mr. Vinas said, and members of the F.B.I.-led Joint Terrorism Task Force took him to Katz’s after his arrest.“A pastrami sandwich can really soften a hard heart,” Mr. Vinas said.He immediately started providing information to the F.B.I. and pleaded guilty in 2009 to federal terrorism charges.He was later transferred to a federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., and put in the witness security program inside its walls, according to former law enforcement officials. He had company: gang members, mobsters and another valuable F.B.I. informant, Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali terrorist captured in international waters near Yemen in 2011.Mr. Vinas spent eight years at Otisville.In all, he took part in 100 interviews, reviewed 1,000 photographs and helped in more than 30 law enforcement investigations, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors have said he was the “single most valuable cooperating witness” about Qaeda activities spanning his time in Afghanistan and Pakistan.Last year, a federal judge sentenced Mr. Vinas to just three more months in prison based on the belief that he was headed to witness protection. The judge was “cautiously optimistic” that Mr. Vinas, who he agreed was a “complex individual,” would stay out of trouble. Mr. Vinas thought he was going to “fade into oblivion somewhere” in witness protection.Federal prosecutors as well as the F.B.I. agents who handled the case pushed hard for witness protection, said Steve Zissou, Mr. Vinas’s lawyer, who believes that Mr. Vinas remains in danger.“That’s not what we do to people who help the United States,” he said. “Vinas paid his dues. At the minimum, he should be given an opportunity to rebuild his life and be safe and secure.”“He never hurt anybody,” Mr. Zissou continued.The information that cooperators provide on people and places beyond the F.B.I.’s reach helps the bureau make cases it likely could not otherwise.“Cooperators are critical because you need an insider’s view,” said Christopher LaVigne, a former federal terrorism prosecutor in Manhattan. “It’s almost essential at terrorism trials. There’s only so much you can obtain and use from overseas.”The government, he said, has to live up to its obligations: “Cooperation is a two-way street.”But one day before he was released, Mr. Vinas learned that he would not be granted protection, angering the judge and Mr. Zissou. The Justice Department’s Office of Enforcement Operations, which approves or denies program applications, conducted a review and turned down Mr. Vinas, the senior government official said. A psychologist who examined Mr. Vinas during his final days in prison said he could be a possible threat to the people protecting him. The psychological evaluation caught everyone off guard, including the judge and Mr. Zissou.Mr. Zissou dismissed the assessment. “He’s not a threat to anybody,” Mr. Zissou said. Another psychologist evaluated Mr. Vinas after his release and said he was not a danger, but the Office of Enforcement Operations did not change its decision.The F.B.I. put him in an extended-stay hotel in New York. Farbod Azad, the F.B.I. agent on his case, once brought him Fruity Pebbles and milk. Mr. Vinas thought that was a nice gesture, but then Mr. Azad said the F.B.I. was done paying for the room.Another government agency paid for another month, Mr. Zissou said, and then Mr. Vinas was sent to what is known as a three-quarters house in New York. He wears an ankle monitor and has a curfew.Mr. Vinas is now on food stamps and Medicaid. He does odd jobs for his lawyer and has had little luck finding a job. He applied to Uber Eats but never heard back. He considered washing windows, but the union said it was not accepting applications.Mr. Vinas realizes he cannot escape what he did. He is still hopeful about his future, but he knows he will not be living anonymously. Perhaps what happened is a blessing.“I don’t have to hide anymore,” he said. “And I am not going to live in fear.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/health/trump-medicaid-arkansas.html","WASHINGTON — Arkansas will be the third state to require many Medicaid recipients to work or train for jobs, after the Trump administration granted it permission on Monday.But the administration held off on approving another request from the state that could have much broader consequences for the future of the program — a proposal to cut back the expansion of Medicaid that was instituted under the Affordable Care Act.Seema Verma, the Trump appointee who oversees Medicaid, did not elaborate when asked twice about the delay at a news conference with Gov. Asa Hutchinson in Little Rock. She said only: “We are still working through some issues in that particular area.”She and Mr. Hutchinson, a Republican, sought instead to emphasize the momentum that work requirements have gathered in the two months since Ms. Verma issued guidance to states allowing them to insist that many people work or prepare for jobs as a condition of keeping their Medicaid coverage. Ms. Verma said eight additional states had submitted work proposals and nine others had signaled interest in the requirements, the first such limits in the more than 50 years since the program was created to provide health insurance to poor Americans.Mr. Hutchinson, who is running for re-election, exhibited the zeal with which Republicans have pursued work requirements this year, saying he expected to roll out Arkansas’s even before the states that already won approval to do so, Kentucky and Indiana.“We are ready with our systems,” Mr. Hutchinson said, noting the state had been preparing for more than a year. “This will be going fairly quickly.”The Arkansas work requirements are somewhat softer than those of the other two states. People younger than 50 will be expected to work, or to train or search for jobs; attend school full time or volunteer — 80 hours a month. Kentucky and Indiana are imposing the requirement on people younger than 65 and 60, respectively. But Arkansas’s plan has harsher consequences for not meeting the requirement: those who do not comply for three months out of a year will be locked out of coverage until the following year.“This is not about punishing anyone,” Mr. Hutchinson said. “It’s about giving people an opportunity to work. It’s about giving them the training they need. It’s about helping them move out of poverty and up the economic ladder.”So far, only one other state, Massachusetts, has joined Arkansas in seeking permission to roll back its Medicaid expansion, and make the program available only to people with incomes below the federal poverty level: $12,060 for a single person, or about twice that amount for a family of four. Under the terms of the Affordable Care Act, states that chose to expand Medicaid had to provide it to everyone with incomes up to 138 percent of that level: $16,642 for a single person.But if the Trump administration allows Arkansas to scale back its Medicaid expansion population, some of the other 31 states that expanded the program will likely want to follow, as a way to save money and appease conservative legislators who think the Obamacare expansion went too far. Other states may be tempted to expand Medicaid, after holding back for years, if they can limit it to those earning at or below the poverty level. The federal government initially paid the full cost of the expansion, but now states are on the hook for 6 percent of the cost; their share will gradually grow to 10 percent over the next few years.The Arkansas proposal would move about 60,000 people out of the program, by lowering the income threshold to the federal poverty level.Mr. Hutchinson wants those earning between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level to move to the Affordable Care Act marketplace, where they would get federal subsidies to buy private insurance. But that could end up costing the federal government more money — another reason the Trump administration may be slow to approve it. President Trump frequently refers to the marketplaces as “failing” and has taken a number of steps to weaken them.Regardless, Mr. Hutchinson said Monday he was optimistic about winning approval to shrink the expansion population after meeting recently with Alex Azar, the new Health and Human Services secretary.Mr. Hutchinson has long been under pressure from conservative Republicans in the Arkansas legislature who say the Medicaid expansion has proved too expensive, with far more people enrolling than originally estimated.Arkansas is anticipating spending about $136 million in general revenue on its Medicaid expansion in the coming fiscal year, with the federal government spending an additional $2 billion. The state uses federal Medicaid funds to buy private insurance for the poor — an alternative that conservative Republicans found acceptable when it was first passed in 2013. About 285,000 people are now enrolled in the Medicaid expansion.Cindy Gillespie, the director of the Arkansas Department of Human Services, said the state was planning to activate an online portal on March 30 where those subject to the requirement will be expected to record how they’re meeting it each month. In June, the state will start phasing it in, relying largely on its Department of Workforce services to connect job seekers with employment, education or training.Kentucky, for its part, is sending out the first notices about its work requirement this week and plans to start rolling it out in July. Indiana will not roll out its work requirement until next year.Like Kentucky and Indiana, Arkansas will exempt people who qualify as “medically frail” from the work requirement, as well as those who are pregnant, in treatment for substance abuse, in school full time or caring for children or someone incapacitated. Nor will those who qualified for Medicaid before the Obamacare expansion — children and disabled or elderly adults — be subject to it.Only people from the ages of 30 through 49 will be subject to the requirement this year, and state officials have estimated that about 60 percent of them — 59,714 out of 98,632 — either work already or will qualify for exemptions.Younger enrollees, down to the age of 19, will be subject to the work requirement starting next year.The National Health Law Program, a nonprofit advocacy group that has already sued to stop Kentucky’s work requirement, said Monday that Arkansas’s also “appears well outside the bounds of the limited authority” that the Department of Health and Human Services has to change Medicaid provisions.“The state’s work requirement program, beyond being legally suspect, will disproportionately harm the most underserved populations,” said Jane Perkins, the program’s legal director.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/thad-cochran-retire-senate.html","WASHINGTON — Senator Thad Cochran, an octogenarian Republican from Mississippi who serves as chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, announced Monday that he is resigning from the Senate on April 1 because of ill health — a decision that will create two Senate races in his home state in November.“I regret my health has become an ongoing challenge,” Mr. Cochran, 80, said in a statement. “I intend to fulfill my responsibilities and commitments to the people of Mississippi and the Senate through the completion of the 2018 appropriations cycle, after which I will formally retire from the U.S. Senate.”Mr. Cochran, who previously served three terms in the House, was first elected to the Senate in 1978, becoming the first Republican in more than 100 years to win a statewide election in Mississippi. He is the tenth-longest serving senator in United States history.Senator Roger Wicker, the junior Republican senator from Mississippi, is already running for re-election this year and has drawn a primary challenge from the same firebrand state senator, Chris McDaniel, who nearly unseated Mr. Cochran in 2014.Mr. Cochran’s retirement means that Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, will have 10 days to appoint an interim senator. A special election would then be held on Election Day in November to fill the rest of Mr. Cochran’s term, which expires in 2020.Multiple Republican officials said Mr. Bryant was likely to pick somebody who would run for the seat in November, avoiding a caretaker. The question now is whether Mr. McDaniel will drop his challenge to Mr. Wicker and try to claim Mr. Cochran’s seat.Mr. McDaniel, a hard-line conservative with a history of making inflammatory statements, had remained silent about his 2018 intentions for months, waiting to see whether Mr. Cochran would resign. By waiting until Monday to reveal his intention to step down, Mr. Cochran effectively forced Mr. McDaniel to enter the race against Mr. Wicker.Yet even as he formally declared his bid last week, Mr. McDaniel did not rule out changing races.“While it is certain that Mississippi will have two U.S. Senate races this year, I am currently focused on my campaign against Roger Wicker,” he said in a statement Monday, “but all options remain on the table as we determine the best way to ensure that Mississippi elects conservatives to the United States Senate.”Mr. Wicker, for his part, was asked by reporters at the Capitol if he was relieved to see Mr. Cochran step aside. “No,” he said. “It’s sad news.”Mr. Bryant has not offered any hints about whom he would appoint to replace Mr. Cochran, but Republicans close to the governor said he would not choose Mr. McDaniel.Immediately after Mr. Cochran put out word on Monday that he would leave the Senate after nearly four decades, the senator’s top aide and close adviser, Brad White, said, “I hope he appoints somebody who can win a general election.”Asked if that includes Mr. McDaniel, Mr. White said, “No.”President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, have encouraged Mr. Bryant to appoint himself, arguing that the party needs to block Mr. McDaniel and forestall any potential replay of the Roy S. Moore debacle last year in Alabama that handed the Democrats a seat in the Deep South.Mr. Bryant has to date resisted the entreaties. If he does not take the seat, the governor is expected to consider Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who is also thought to want to run for governor when Mr. Bryant becomes term-limited in 2019, and Secretary of State Delbert Hoseman. Other possibilities include the State House speaker, Philip Gun, and the state auditor, Stacey Pickering.Democrats have not won a Senate race in Mississippi since 1982, when the veteran Senator John Stennis defeated Haley Barbour, but state and national Republicans worry about whether their grip on the state’s two seats could be in peril should Mr. McDaniel find success. Last week, David Baria, the State House Democratic leader, announced his intention to run for Mr. Wicker’s seat. Democrats have also wooed Brandon Presley, a cousin to Elvis Presley and the chairman of the state’s Public Service Commission, to run for the Senate.Mike Espy, a former Democratic congressman and agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration, said late Monday that he would consider running for Mr. Cochran’s seat.Mr. Espy, who is African-American and from a prominent Delta family, could be a formidable candidate in a state where black voters make up much of the Democratic Party.Democrats are watching which race Mr. McDaniel chooses, hoping to put their most formidable candidate against the state senator.Mr. Cochran has been a genteel presence in the Senate for decades, but in recent years his physical decline has become apparent. On Monday, as the Senate voted on two judicial nominations, he was guided into the chamber by aides and was silent as reporters peppered him with questions.His decision to leave opens up the coveted chairman’s spot on the Senate Appropriations Committee, where leadership is determined by seniority. The senator next in line is Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. Asked if he wants the job, Mr. Shelby said, “It would be a great honor, but I’m not there yet,” and added, “I would be interested at the proper time.”Longtime members of the Senate said they were sorry to see Mr. Cochran go. “I’m devastated,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the most senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.“I assumed we would serve out our time together here,” Mr. Leahy said, adding, “He has always, always, always kept his word, and I wish to heck some other senators around here would learn to do that.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/sam-nunberg-special-counsel-grand-jury.html","WASHINGTON — It began with a subpoena. It ended with a question about whether its recipient was drunk on live television.Sam Nunberg, a onetime Trump campaign aide who recently met with investigators for the special counsel, set cable news alight on Monday when he declared that he was subpoenaed to go before a grand jury on Friday, but that he was unlikely to appear or to provide documents he was ordered to hand over.He indicated he did not know what the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was seeking by ordering him to appear before the grand jury and to turn over a number of documents. There was no way to authenticate the subpoena; Mr. Mueller’s office declined to comment.But Mr. Nunberg said he was unconcerned about the potential for being arrested. By midafternoon, he had been interviewed on MSNBC and CNN. Fox News soon joined in with coverage.On air, Mr. Nunberg denigrated Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, as a “slob.” Twitter cataloged his insults, mesmerized by his repeat performances. One CNN host asked him if he had been drinking.By evening, Mr. Nunberg told reporters he might comply with Mr. Mueller’s demand after all. Unless he doesn’t, of course.And so it went with Mr. Nunberg, a protégé of the self-described dirty trickster Roger J. Stone Jr., who has been a focus of aspects of the various investigations into possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.Part of the subpoena document, which Mr. Nunberg provided to The New York Times, is dated Feb. 27 and makes no mention of requiring him to appear before the grand jury. It calls only for him to preserve documents from Nov. 1, 2015, through the present related to several people connected to the Trump campaign. They include President Trump; the departing White House communications director, Hope Hicks; the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski; Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist; Mr. Trump’s longtime bodyguard, Keith Schiller; the former Trump Organization lawyer Michael D. Cohen; and Mr. Stone, a longtime confidant of Mr. Trump’s.“They have requested a ridiculous amount of documents,” Mr. Nunberg said. “Should I spend 30 hours producing these? I don’t know what they have. They may very well have something on the president. But they are unfairly targeting Roger Stone.”The subpoena also demands any documents related to Carter Page, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who was secretly surveilled by the Justice Department as part of the Russia investigation, as well as Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, and his deputy, Rick Gates. Mr. Manafort has been indicted on a string of money laundering and fraud charges, and Mr. Gates recently pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mr. Mueller’s investigators.The list of people about whom Mr. Mueller is seeking information from Mr. Nunberg raises questions about his target, as does the time frame. Mr. Nunberg was fired by Mr. Trump during the summer of 2015 and thus was gone from the campaign in November. And he and Mr. Lewandowski are known to be combatants.Still, Mr. Nunberg — whose mentor, Mr. Stone, goes by the motto that all press is good press — spent hours on Monday engaged in a media tour with The Times, The Washington Post, CNN and MSNBC, describing his plans to flout the subpoena and professing his lack of concern about what could happen to him.“I was fired within six weeks” of the campaign’s start, Mr. Nunberg told The Times, despite having “saved” Mr. Trump during a fight with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, that summer after Mr. Trump’s remark that Mr. McCain was not a war hero because he was captured in Vietnam. Mr. McCain was shot down during the war and imprisoned for more than five years in Hanoi, refusing early release even after being beaten repeatedly.Mr. Nunberg added that the president often sounded “like a moron, but this whole thing is a witch hunt.”Mr. Nunberg said he anticipated his lawyer, Patrick J. Brackley, would fire him for speaking publicly. Mr. Brackley did not immediately respond to an email asking whether that was the case.Mr. Nunberg could avoid appearing before the grand jury if his lawyer sent prosecutors a letter asserting his Fifth Amendment rights not to incriminate himself. If that does not happen, Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors could ask a judge for a bench warrant for Mr. Nunberg’s arrest.Mr. Nunberg has spoken with the Senate Intelligence Committee in its own investigation into Russian election meddling, according to a person familiar with the matter. He has not spoken with the House Intelligence Committee, according to three of its members. Its own examination of Moscow interference has languished amid partisan infighting.Mr. Stone, asked for comment, said he was not surprised that his information was being sought.“I was part of the Trump campaign, have been the president’s friend and adviser for decades, and would expect that Mueller’s team would ask for any documents or emails sent or written by me,” Mr. Stone said in a text message. “But let me reiterate, I have no knowledge or involvement in Russian collusion or any other inappropriate act.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/speaker-paul-ryan-trump.html","WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a fierce believer in America as a land of immigrants, recently attended a dinner party with a so-called Dreamer. When she pleaded with him to help young undocumented immigrants like herself gain legal status, he hesitated — the House, he said, would pass only legislation that President Trump would sign.He again held back last month after the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee confronted him over their conclusion that Republican aides on the House Intelligence Committee had leaked the private text messages of a senior senator to Fox News. The senators asked for no specific action, and Mr. Ryan offered none.But when Mr. Trump challenged Republican free-trade orthodoxy, Mr. Ryan — a fervent advocate of trade accords for decades — had to respond, albeit four days later and through his press secretary. The speaker, his spokeswoman said, was “extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war” that could be sparked by the president’s steel and aluminum tariffs.On one contentious issue after another — the investigation of Russian interference in American elections, trade, immigration and gun control — a speaker who rose to prominence as an outspoken, almost brash leader, determined to bring his party along with his vision of governance, has receded. Instead, he wields his gavel gingerly.Even on one of his signature issues, free trade, he has mostly worked behind the scenes to change the president’s mind.“I think Ryan’s expectations had to be dramatically reduced when Trump became president,” said Peter Wehner, a onetime adviser to former President George W. Bush who is close to the speaker. “I think in a lot of ways he was forced into a defensive posture rather than an offensive posture.”To supporters like Mr. Wehner, Mr. Ryan’s approach is pure pragmatism and smart politics. Facing a divided Republican conference and a mercurial president of his party, they say, he has little choice but to curb some of his own instincts, work behind the scenes and steer Mr. Trump gently. He also must guide House Republicans into a very difficult midterm election campaign, where his main job is to ensure that vulnerable members get re-elected. And those close to Mr. Ryan note that, with the exception of trade, he has not had serious policy disagreements with the president.But Mr. Ryan had modeled himself as a different kind of leader, the youthful face of a new brand of conservatism that was to broaden his party’s appeal and move it beyond 1980s-style Reaganism. His 2012 run for vice president lifted his national profile and fortified his standing. So to critics, the leader once described as “the intellectual center of Republicans in the House” has abandoned principles to hang onto a job he ostensibly never wanted.“I’m tired of saying deep in his heart there is a different Paul Ryan,” said Charles J. Sykes, a conservative commentator and former radio host in Mr. Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin, who for years promoted Mr. Ryan as a potential presidential candidate.Conservative critiques of Mr. Trump, from senators such as Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have gone beyond policy disagreements, to temperament, defenses of democratic institutions and law enforcement, and the conduct of foreign policy. And other Republican leaders are speaking out. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is giving almost daily speeches on the Senate floor pushing for action on a modest but bipartisan bill to fortify the existing background check system for gun purchases.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee and a loud supporter of Mr. Trump, nonetheless scorched his tariffs as “a tax hike the American people don’t need and can’t afford.”Mr. Ryan has repeatedly urged Mr. Trump to abandon the tariffs in private, according to one person familiar with their conversations. In public, he has held his tongue. He declined to be interviewed.“I always imagined that there was room for an alternative conservative vision to Trumpism, and Paul Ryan was ideally suited to be that leader of a non-Trumpist conservative Republican Party, but he’s chosen not to assume that role,” Mr. Sykes said. “It’s very disappointing to see he’s become so comfortable as an ally and an enabler of Trump.”For Democrats, the speaker’s deference to Mr. Trump is the stuff of ridicule — and a constitutional dereliction of duty by the man three steps from the presidency.“Can you imagine Tip O’Neill or Sam Rayburn or any of the portraits in this gallery saying, ‘I don’t know whether I can be for that, I’ve got to go down the street and ask permission of the president’?” asked Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, referring to previous speakers whose portraits hang just outside the House chamber.To be sure, Mr. Ryan has had some achievements, notably the rewrite of the federal tax code, which for the speaker marked the realization of a long-held dream. He pushed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act through the House, only to see it die in the Senate. And he helped negotiate a two-year budget deal that should bring some peace to Washington even as it balloons federal spending.“Speaker Ryan has taken on all the challenges of the modern speakership and deftly kept the conference united while advancing an historic conservative agenda,” said Mr. Ryan’s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong. She cited in particular the tax code rewrite and the budget deal’s provisions for “the rebuilding of our depleted military.”Mr. Ryan has not always been so deferential. When Mr. Trump attacked a Mexican-American judge during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Ryan called the comments the “textbook definition of a racist comment.” When the infamous Access Hollywood tape came out, showing Mr. Trump boasting of sexually assaulting women, Mr. Ryan saw to it that Mr. Trump was disinvited to a rally in Wisconsin.“They’re from entirely different worlds,” Mr. Wehner said. “That said, Ryan knows he has to deal with Trump, and Trump has probably figured out he has to rely on Ryan.”Now 48, Mr. Ryan became the youngest speaker since 1869 when he was elected to the post in the fall of 2015, replacing John A. Boehner, who was effectively pushed out by conservatives in his unruly conference. Mr. Ryan told his colleagues then that he would accept the speakership only if all factions would unite behind him.To a certain extent, he has succeeded.But in the name of unity, he has governed with a light hand. Last month, the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee confronted Mr. Ryan after they concluded that the House Intelligence Committee had leaked a senator’s private texts — a serious breach of protocol. Although the senators raised concerns about the direction of the committee under its chairman, Devin Nunes of California, Mr. Ryan apparently chose not to intervene.“The speaker heard the senators on their concerns and encouraged them to take them up directly with their counterparts,” said his spokeswoman, Ms. Strong.If Mr. Ryan is known for one quality, House Republicans say, it is his willingness to listen. Members of his conference view him as “inclusive and fair,” said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania.But in a chamber where 218 votes are required to pass legislation, Mr. Ryan still faces the same fundamental problem as his predecessor: He has difficulty bringing his fractious conference together. That means he must watch his step.Unlike Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, who was speaker from 2007 to 2011, he is not a forceful presence in the House chamber. As speaker, Ms. Pelosi ruled the House with an iron fist, guiding dozens of bills large and small into law. She engineered passage of even doomed bills like a climate change bill that died in the Senate — and likely cost Democrats seats in the 2010 Republican landslide. She emerged as the undisputable face of her caucus, to some members’ chagrin.That is not Mr. Ryan’s style.“It’s hard for anyone be a strong speaker in the traditional sense around here because the speaker is only as strong as his conference allows him to be,” Mr. Dent said. “And because on many issues the speaker cannot get 218 Republican votes, that weakens his position.”Apart from the tax overhaul, that has made for narrow legislative proposals. With Republicans under intense pressure to address gun violence after the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., Mr. Ryan swatted away any suggestion last week that the House would take expansive action.The chamber has already adopted a measure to make modest changes to the national instant background check database, coupled with a measure pushed by the gun lobby to expand the reach of concealed weapons permits. The speaker said Republican leaders now are waiting for the Senate to act.“I’m not going to micromanage this,” he said at a news conference.But there are consequences to Mr. Ryan’s low-key style. Big issues like immigration are languishing with no resolution in sight. Causes that were once Mr. Ryan’s signature fights — an exploding budget deficit, soaring Medicare and Social Security spending and an entrenched welfare state — are on nobody’s must-do list. Even Mr. Boehner, never viewed as a policymaking powerhouse, at least tried to negotiate a “grand bargain” with the White House that was to slow entitlement spending, cut other parts of the government and raise revenue to balance the budget.Mr. Ryan’s break with Mr. Trump on trade came only after several other Republicans made clear that they were not standing by the president. Republicans are running for re-election on the strength of the economy, hoping that voters credit their policies, especially the tax cuts. But a trade war marked by a spike in consumer prices could jeopardize their survival strategy.To Representative Brian Mast, Republican of Florida and a combat veteran who lost both his legs in Afghanistan, Mr. Ryan’s suggestion that the House wait for the Senate to act on guns is not good enough after the Parkland slaughter.“If we believe that tax reform is a do-or-die issue that we have to get done but we can’t say that protecting our kids is that same kind of issue, then that’s not leadership,” said Mr. Mast, who backed an assault weapons ban after the bloodshed in Parkland.Conservatives, meanwhile, have put Mr. Ryan on notice that he does not have free rein. Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was instrumental in the ouster of Mr. Boehner, and he suggested last month that a misstep on immigration in particular could cost Mr. Ryan his job.“I can say that it is a defining moment for this speaker,” Mr. Meadows said then. “If he gets it wrong, it will have consequences for him.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/world/asia/nastya-rybka-trump-putin.html","BANGKOK — A Belarusian escort with close ties to a powerful Russian oligarch said from behind bars in Bangkok on Monday that she had more than 16 hours of audio recordings that could help shed light on Russian meddling in United States elections.The escort, Anastasia Vashukevich, said she would hand over the recordings if the United States  granted her asylum. She faces criminal charges and deportation to Belarus after coming under suspicion of working in Thailand without a visa at a sex-training seminar in the city of Pattaya.Ms. Vashukevich, who described herself as close to the Russian aluminum tycoon Oleg V. Deripaska, said that audio recordings she made in August 2016 included discussions he had about the United States presidential election with people she declined to identify.Mr. Deripaska, a billionaire with close ties to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, also has business ties to Paul J. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman. Mr. Manafort is under investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel looking into the campaign’s connections to Russia.“If America gives me protection, I will tell everything I know,” Ms. Vashukevich said on Monday. “I am afraid to go back to Russia. Some strange things can happen.”Her assertion could be easy to disregard were it not for a 25-minute video investigation posted last month on YouTube by the Russian opposition figure Aleksei A. Navalny, which relies heavily on videos and photographs from Ms. Vashukevich.She and nine people from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus were arrested late last month in Pattaya, a city about 70 miles south of Bangkok known for its adult entertainment scene. Most of those arrested, including Ms. Vashukevich, 21, who also goes by the name Nastya Rybka, are accused of working without a permit. Some are also accused of not having a valid Thai visa.Ms. Vashukevich and Alexander Kirillov, the organizer of the sex seminar, spoke to three reporters while standing behind bars and a mesh screen during visiting hours at the Immigration Detention Center in Bangkok. Immigration officials stopped the interviews midway and told the reporters to leave the facility.Ms. Vashukevich, wearing a bright green T-shirt with the word “detainee” in Thai, is a long way from the days she spent sailing on a yacht with Mr. Deripaska and his friends, including Sergei E. Prikhodko, a deputy prime minister.According to her version of events, she was working for a modeling agency when she and several other models were sent to spend time on Mr. Deripaska’s yacht. She later posted photographs and videos on social media showing Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Prikhodko together on the yacht.Financial records show that companies controlled by Mr. Manafort owed millions of dollars to Mr. Deripaska. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Manafort offered to give Mr. Deripaska private briefings on the campaign.Mr. Navalny charged in his video that Mr. Deripaska’s yacht trip was an attempt to bribe Mr. Prikhodko, and that Ms. Vashukevich was one of “several” prostitutes aboard the vessel. In the video, the tycoon and Mr. Prikhodko can be heard discussing Russian-American relations. The video also highlights a book Ms. Vashukevich wrote titled “Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire.”Russia has tried to block Mr. Navalny’s video, which had nearly 6.4 million views on YouTube as of Monday. A spokesman for Mr. Deripaska has said the allegations of bribery and prostitutes on the yacht were a “hot story that appears far from being the truth.”In the interview at the immigration center on Monday, Ms. Vashukevich said that she had often recorded conversations between Mr. Deripaska and his associates, and that she had 16 to 18 hours of recordings, including conversations about the United States presidential election.“They were discussing elections,” she said. “Deripaska had a plan about elections.”But, she added, “I can’t tell you everything.”Some of the conversations were with three people who spoke English fluently and who she thought were Americans, she said.“It is not only about me,” she said. “It concerns a lot of people in America and other countries.”Ms. Vashukevich and Mr. Kirillov, who also goes by the name Alex Lesley, are prominent on social media and are considered by some to be publicity seekers.Ms. Vashukevich took part in a small protest in Moscow last year defending Harvey Weinstein after he faced numerous accusations of sexual abuse. Standing mostly naked near the American Embassy, she and four other women held signs with slogans such as “Hands Off Harvey” and “Harvey Weinstein Welcome to Russia.”Ms. Vashukevich said she arrived in Thailand on Feb. 16, and that she was only an observer at the sex seminar but did not work at the event.Several attendees said that no sex had been involved, and that the multiday training had focused on improving communication and on perfecting the art of seduction.Those who are taken to the immigration detention center are often on the verge of being deported. But an immigration official said that Ms. Vashukevich and five others taken to the center still faced criminal charges for their part in the seminar. They will be sent back to Pattaya for court proceedings.Ms. Vashukevich described being held in a crowded cell with more than 100 women and only three toilets. She said a Thai official had asked her to sign a paper saying that she believed she would be safe in Russia, but that she had refused.In general, people seeking asylum must apply in the country where they hope to take refuge.A spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Bangkok said she was aware of the arrests but declined to discuss the case or any asylum request.Mr. Kirillov said that he believed publicity would help protect them. “I think the press makes us a little bit safer because if they killed us in the prison, everyone would know,” he said.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/old-death-row-executions-supreme-court.html","WASHINGTON — The nation’s death rows are starting to look like geriatric wards. Condemned inmates in many states are more likely to die of natural causes than to be executed. The rare ones who are put to death often first spend decades behind bars, waiting.It turns out that executing old men is not easy. In November, Ohio called off an attempt to execute Alva Campbell, 69, after the execution team could not find a suitable vein into which to pump lethal chemicals. The state announced that it would try again in June 2019, by which time he would have been 71.But Mr. Campbell suffered from what one judge called an “extraordinary list of ailments.” He used a walker, could barely breathe and relied on a colostomy bag. He was found lifeless in his cell on Saturday, having died in the usual way, without government assistance.In Alabama last month, state officials called off the execution of Doyle Lee Hamm, 61, also because they could not find a suitable vein. Mr. Hamm has at least two kinds of cancer, cranial and lymphatic, and he may not have long to live with or without the state’s efforts.Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of another Alabama inmate, Vernon Madison, 67, who suffers from dementia and cannot remember the crime that sent him to death row. The court, which has barred the execution of juvenile offenders and the intellectually disabled, is now turning its attention to old people.In 1985, Mr. Madison killed a police officer, Julius Schulte, who had been trying to keep the peace between Mr. Madison and his ex-girlfriend, Cheryl Greene, as she sought to eject him from what had been their shared home. Mr. Madison shot Ms. Greene, too, wounding her.Mr. Madison remembers none of this. He has suffered at least two severe strokes, and he is blind and incontinent. His speech is slurred, and what he says does not always make sense.He has asked that his mother be told of his strokes, but his mother is dead. He soils himself, saying “no one will let me out to use the bathroom,” though there is a toilet in his cell. He says he plans to move to Florida. He can recite the alphabet, but only to the letter G.Mr. Madison also insists that he “never went around killing folks.”A court-appointed psychologist found that Mr. Madison had “significant body and cognitive decline as a result of strokes.” But the psychologist testified that Mr. Madison understood what he was accused of and how the state planned to punish him. According to Steve Marshall, Alabama’s attorney general, that is enough.The Supreme Court’s precedents bar the execution of people who lack a “rational understanding” of the reason they are to be put to death.Mr. Marshall told the justices that Mr. Madison satisfied that standard. “The ability to form a rational understanding of an event,” he wrote in January in a brief urging the justices to stay out of the case, “has very limited relation to whether a person remembers that event.”Mr. Madison’s case, which has been bouncing around the court system for more than 30 years, has taken some unusual turns.His first conviction was reversed because prosecutors violated the Constitution by excluding all seven potential jurors who were black. His second conviction was thrown out after prosecutors committed misconduct by using expert testimony to tell the jury about evidence never properly introduced.At Mr. Madison’s third trial, the jury voted to sentence him to life in prison. But Judge Ferrill D. McRae, of Mobile County Circuit Court, overrode that verdict and sentenced Mr. Madison to death.I interviewed Judge McRae in 2011, not long before he died. I had sought him out because he had achieved a rare distinction. He had overridden six jury verdicts calling for life sentences, a state record, while never rejecting a jury’s recommendation of death.Alabama juries are not notably squeamish about the death penalty, but Judge McRae said they needed to be corrected when they were seized by an impulse toward mercy. “If you didn’t have something like that,” he said of judicial overrides, “a jury with no experience in other cases would be making the ultimate decision, based on nothing.”Alabama abolished judicial overrides last year.In 2016, Mr. Madison came very close to being put to death. A deadlocked eight-member Supreme Court refused to vacate a stay of execution issued by a federal appeals court, with the court’s four conservative members saying they would have let the execution proceed. Justice Antonin Scalia had died a few months before, leaving the Supreme Court short-handed. Had Justice Scalia lived, Mr. Madison would almost certainly be dead by now.The case took some additional procedural twists, and Mr. Madison returned to the Supreme Court in January after a state court again ruled against him. The Supreme Court stayed his execution, though the court’s three most conservative members — Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch — said they would have let it go forward.The case, Madison v. Alabama, No. 17-7505, will be argued in the fall, and it will give the court a chance to consider some profound questions.“Mr. Madison is one among a growing number of aging prisoners who remain on death row in this country for ever longer periods of time,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote in a concurring opinion when the court considered an earlier appeal. “Given this trend, we may face ever more instances of state efforts to execute prisoners suffering the diseases and infirmities of old age.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/trump-nuclear-russia-containment.html","WASHINGTON — Just hours after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia boasted last week about producing “invincible” new nuclear arms designed to evade American missile defenses, President Trump’s nominee to command the nation’s military cyberunits was being grilled at a Senate confirmation hearing about another vexing Russian threat.Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone, the nominee to run the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, acknowledged that plans were in place to strike back at Moscow for its election hacking. Those actions would require Mr. Trump’s approval.But General Nakasone said the Russians, as well as America’s other adversaries in cyberspace, seem unimpressed.“I would say right now they do not think much will happen to them,” he said. “They don’t fear us.”The Russian muscle-flexing and the American hand-wringing captured a strategic vacuum that now envelops Washington as Mr. Putin pursues what he views as a complementary new-generation nuclear arsenal, as well as cyberweapons.By comparison, the United States is still uncertain how to make use of its cyberweapons after spending billions of dollars to build an arsenal. It is concerned that the Russians — along with the Chinese, the Iranians and the North Koreans — could easily retaliate against any attack, striking American banks, utilities, stock markets and communications networks.And in the nuclear sphere, the Trump administration has yet to offer a strategy to contain or deter Russia beyond simply matching the weapons buildup. Mr. Trump himself has largely remained silent about his vision to contain Russian power, and has not expressed hope of luring Moscow into new rounds of negotiations to prevent a recurrent arms race.The threat that Russia poses on both fronts has helped push the United States to declare a fundamental shift on national security: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis asserted in January that “great power competition,” not terrorism, is now the primary American focus.Washington’s response — at least in the nuclear realm — also harks back to the Cold War era: a cycle of move and countermove. This time, however, it involves not just building larger stockpiles, but also developing new types of weapons of greater sophistication, matched with more advanced missile defenses.“Putin has become the best friend of the U.S. nuclear arms industry,” said nonproliferation expert Gary Samore. He negotiated with the Russians during the Clinton administration, when optimism ran high that the era of nuclear competition was over, and again during the Obama administration, after Mr. Putin had begun Moscow’s current nuclear modernization.The Pentagon believes that many of the new plans that Mr. Putin announced last week to bolster his arsenal — including undersea nuclear torpedoes, nuclear cruise missiles and other new weapons — are years away from deployment. He has called his new missiles “invincible,” as some can evade missile defenses, and started a contest to name them.Mr. Putin has blamed the United States’ failure to embrace past arms control treaties as the reason for his buildup. But he has particularly complained about American nuclear defenses, which he said were aimed as much at Russia as they were at North Korea. American officials have said that is a wild misstatement of the technology’s reach.In his State of the Union speech in January, Mr. Trump demanded that Congress “modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal.” That was followed in February by the administration’s Nuclear Posture Review, which was more specific. It called for new, low-yield nuclear weapons that it justified on the basis of recent Russian advances. It also described in detail a once top-secret Russian autonomous nuclear torpedo that is designed to cross the Pacific.Additionally, the nuclear review abandoned earlier promises by the Obama administration that nuclear weapons would be a diminishing part of American security and defense. “Past assumptions that our capability to produce nuclear weapons would not be necessary and that we could permit the required infrastructure to age into obsolescence have proven to be mistaken,” the document said.Drafts of a new missile defense strategy, which may be published later this month, include suggestions that the program may now turn to developing missile defenses against Russia and China, not just countering states like North Korea with smaller arsenals.“We must no longer think in terms of building just ‘limited’ missile defense capabilities,” concluded a report that was issued last year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “The United States should begin the journey to develop a next-generation missile defense.”It called for pursuing a “space-based kill layer” that would try to shoot down swarms of enemy warheads and missiles — a step that would go beyond the Reagan administration’s “Star Wars” research on space arms and no doubt prompt new rounds of reaction from Mr. Putin and the Russian military.Particularly striking is the absence of much interest in Washington or Moscow for arms control talks.From President John F. Kennedy’s time in office through President Barack Obama’s, new treaties were negotiated that first limited atmospheric testing, then the numbers of weapons that could be deployed. The result was an 85 percent decline in the number of nuclear weapons in the world.But the most recent arms reduction treaty, called New Start, expires in early 2021. Mr. Trump has not expressed interest in renewing it. And there is evidence that even before its scheduled sunset, expensive new cycles of technological action and reaction are beginning to take shape.Over the past few months, most talk of restraint has been cast to the wind as Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump take steps to rebuild their arsenals, according to arms control advocates. Doing so portends a new generation of nuclear weapons, as such moves and countermoves create a rationale for building more.Lisbeth Gronlund, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, based in Cambridge, Mass., said Mr. Putin’s announcement last week “further ratchets up what is clearly a new arms race, making the world a more dangerous place.”But what worries veterans of that Cold War is less the new technology than the old rhetoric.“None of this changes the fundamental picture of what the U.S. and Russia do to each other,” Matthew Bunn, a Harvard professor who is one of the directors of the Managing the Atom project, told a group of journalists at the Nieman Foundation in Cambridge on Friday.He said what is changing “is the degree of tension” that revives the dangers of miscalculations that could lead to military action — the great fear at the height of the Cold War during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.The cyberchallenge is the newest one, and thus is not captive to the strategies of past generations. But in public statements in recent weeks, Mr. Trump’s top intelligence officials have conceded that the president has yet to discuss strategies with them to prevent the Russians from interfering in the midterm elections this year. Mr. Trump has expressed severe doubts that the Russians meddled in 2016, contradicting the conclusions of his intelligence officials.Two days before General Nakasone’s hearing last week, the man he would replace at the N.S.A. and Cyber Command — Adm. Michael S. Rogers — offered striking testimony in what is likely to be his last public appearance on Capitol Hill before leaving office.Four years ago, after he took command, Admiral Rogers said one of his goals was to assure that American adversaries would “pay a price” for their cyberactions against the United States that “will far outweigh the benefit” derived from hacking. He also frequently said that the retaliation might not necessarily be a counter-cyberstrike, but could involve economic sanctions or diplomatic isolation.However, last week Admiral Rogers conceded that his own test had not been met.Pressed about what pressure he had put on the Russians, he said: “We’re taking steps, but we’re probably not doing enough.” He also dismissed sanctions that Congress approved last year — and that Mr. Trump has failed to impose — as insufficient to change “the calculus or the behavior” of Mr. Putin.At General Nakasone’s confirmation hearing two days later, Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, said that “the problem is not technical,” but political, given the United States’ impressive cyberarsenal.“We are not responding in any way that’s adequate to the challenge we face,” Mr. Sasse said.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/us/politics/trump-trade-tariffs-peter-navarro-wilbur-ross.html","WASHINGTON — The White House continued to sow uncertainty on Sunday about the stiff tariffs President Trump said he would impose on steel and aluminum imports as key advisers defended the policy but left room for the president to change his plans.Peter Navarro, an adviser and the architect of many of Mr. Trump’s campaign trade promises, confirmed on Sunday that the president would not exclude any country from the tariffs but said individual companies could apply for exemptions for certain products.Mr. Trump, meanwhile, engaged in a weekend-long tweet storm defending his policies and saying the United States had been on the “losing side” of global trade deals for too long.“We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday night. “Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry, it’s time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”Mr. Trump rattled stock markets last week with his impromptu announcement that he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports and as business executives said the president would make no country exceptions.“As soon as he starts exempting countries, he has to raise the tariff on everybody else,” Mr. Navarro said on “Fox News Sunday.” “As soon as he exempts one country, his phone starts ringing from the heads of state of other countries.”But Mr. Navarro left room for change in the timing of the tariffs, which the president said would be signed this week. “Toward the end of the week,” Mr. Navarro said in a separate appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” when asked when the tariffs would be announced. “At the latest, it would be the following week.”Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, also appeared to leave room for the president to change his mind.“Whatever his final decision is, is what will happen,” Mr. Ross said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “What he has said he has said. If he says something different, it’ll be something different.”“If he for some reason should change his mind, then it will change,” Mr. Ross added, noting that he had no reason to believe that the president would do so.That followed similar equivocation by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, who was asked on Friday whether Mr. Trump was committed to the tariffs he announced in a hastily arranged meeting on Thursday. “Never say never, but I think he’s pretty committed to moving this forward,” she said.The announcement of tariffs on Thursday capped off a chaotic week at the White House, which has been bedeviled by staff departures and fierce disputes over policy. Some top White House staff were unaware the president was going to roll out these tariffs until he did so on national television.Mr. Navarro and Mr. Ross have been among the staunchest defenders of the trade action, which would hit global trading partners like Canada and South Korea much more than China, which the administration has described as the primary culprit in putting American metal makers out of business. Both men backed the tariffs, saying the benefits to American metal makers would be considerable and the costs to industries that use those metals in their products — like automakers and food packagers — negligible.Mr. Ross described the effect of the tariff as “a fraction of a penny on a can of beer.” Mr. Navarro clashed with Chris Wallace of Fox News, who tried to get the economic adviser to admit that those costs, when multiplied by all products that use steel and aluminum over the entire economy, would escalate into the billions of dollars. Mr. Navarro said he saw the costs as “insignificant” in the mission to preserve the steel and aluminum industries, which have seen factories pick up and move from the United States to cheaper parts of the world.The White House’s plan continued to face fierce criticism, including from Republicans who believe free trade is in the interest of the economy.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, criticized the tariffs for falling more heavily on American allies than on China, which he said had earlier flooded the global market with steel.Economists say the tariffs, if applied without exceptions, would harm allies like Canada, South Korea and the European Union, which export more steel to the United States than China does. Shortly after the tariffs were announced, the European Union responded by saying that it was already preparing to levy retaliatory tariffs on American products, including orange juice, bluejeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.“You’re letting China off the hook,” Mr. Graham said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “China wins when we fight with Europe.”Joshua B. Bolten, the head of the Business Roundtable and chief of staff in the George W. Bush administration, called the tariffs “a huge mistake.”Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Mr. Bolten acknowledged that the president was trying to fulfill his campaign promises and help American workers in the steel and aluminum industries. But Mr. Bolten said the tariffs would cause “huge damage across broad sectors of the economy” that use steel and aluminum in their products, or that face retaliation from angry trading partners.That did not dissuade Mr. Navarro, who doubled down on comments he made on Friday arguing that trading partners would not retaliate against the United States because they fear losing access to the valuable American market.“All we are asking for is fair and reciprocal trade,” Mr. Navarro said on “Fox News Sunday.” “What we need to do here is keep the rhetoric down.”Since the announcement, the president has only ratcheted up his language on trade, tweeting several times about trade policy and the disadvantage he believes the United States faces. He criticized past trade policy, threatened to levy a tax on countries that retaliated against the tariffs and called for rebuilding the steel industry.“When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,” he tweeted on Saturday.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/us/politics/kellyanne-conway-white-house.html","WASHINGTON — A year ago, few “on the outside” — a phrase perhaps tellingly favored in the Trump White House — would have guessed that Kellyanne Conway would be the one hanging on as other high-profile aides pull their rip cords.A year ago, Ms. Conway, the president’s counselor, told Americans of the fictional “Bowling Green massacre,” drawing ridicule from cable TV hosts and liberal critics. She declared that the White House was merely presenting “alternative facts” when it described an inauguration crowd in superlatives that did not comport with reality. She was painted into an unhinged “Saturday Night Live” caricature. For a pollster with a long history of working well with the news media, the attacks were jarring, according to her allies.But in this White House, a lot can change in a year.More than a dozen high-profile departures later — and amid tumult, scandal and an ever-unfolding investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia — Ms. Conway, 51, is one of the few remaining prominent aides from the campaign. In a White House with the highest turnover rates in decades, she has survived by knowing when to step back from the spotlight, keeping the president’s ear, focusing on a policy issue significant to the poor and working class, and maintaining an unflinching loyalty to President Trump even as she outmaneuvers rivals on the staff.The public criticism hasn’t abated, but Ms. Conway’s skin is thicker than it used to be.“I don’t respond to or read 99 percent of it,” Ms. Conway said in a brief interview on Saturday, “because it is so reflexive and unthoughtful.”She couldn’t resist adding a half-jab, half-joke: “I do wonder what everybody is so miserable about.”Alongside aides including Hope Hicks, who said last week that she would depart her role as White House communications director, Ms. Conway ran the campaign through its stormy final days, and then followed her candidate to the White House. In those early months, in an act born of savvy or necessity, Ms. Conway stepped back from the media glare to focus on demonstrating to her colleagues and her critics that she was as capable on policy as she was sparring with talking heads on TV.Her choice seems to have paid off.“She has this unique position that she’s earned,” said former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who worked closely on the opioid crisis with Ms. Conway and credited her with urging the president to personalize the issue through his brother’s experience with addiction. “She’s gotten a bad rap at times, but I think that’s because of some of the really awful people inside the White House who have been trying to hurt her, as opposed to anything the press came up with on its own.”In recent months, Ms. Conway has watched, somewhat from the sidelines, as John F. Kelly, the president’s current chief of staff, came in and pledged to bring order to the West Wing, dispatching a number of aides who had once envied the access Ms. Conway cultivated with the president.“He came around and wanted to know what everyone had been working on for the first six months,” Ms. Conway said, “and some of us were just better equipped to handle that question than others.”For the president, Ms. Conway, an outspoken opponent of abortion, is one of his most prominent ties to the conservative movement.Representative Mark Meadows, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Ms. Conway had been wise to engage in public appearances only “at times when the president has asked her to engage.”“It’s not about Kellyanne,” he said. “It’s about the president of the United States and this country.”Mr. Meadows added: “The limelight is not the primary concern for getting her agenda done, and I think that has served her well.”She has told allies in and outside the West Wing that her respect is not just for the president, but the presidency as an institution. Still, one of her biggest strengths, those who know her say, is that she has always understood whom she works for. Loyalty to her clients always came easily, but this time, her client just happens to be in the Oval Office.“I think that she is the president’s political adviser and she is someone who is very skilled on television,” Mr. Christie said. “She’s unique in the White House in someone who can give him both political and policy advice.”Mr. Christie said that, early on, this prompted other aides to target her. A friend of Ms. Conway’s, who didn’t want to be identified because of the social opprobrium she would face as a Democrat, said Ms. Conway had particularly struggled with Reince Priebus, the president’s former chief of staff, during the first chaotic months of the administration. She also survived efforts to curtail her influence by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, who for months privately bristled over Ms. Conway’s getting credit for the campaign victory.But, that friend said, she learned that if her colleagues did not take her seriously, she could use it to her advantage. She kept her head down while other aides burned out, and kept her access to the president.In fact, her portfolio has grown, with the addition of the opioid crisis and coordination with cabinet secretaries, which originally fell under Mr. Kushner’s purview. On Thursday, she put together an opioid summit meeting with cabinet members at the White House, which the president briefly joined.Other Republicans say her loyalty to Mr. Trump — and thus her ability to survive in his chaotic White House — is no virtue.“She has no shame,” Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, said in a text message, “and that is a quality the president values.”Ms. Conway, of course, would see it differently. She refers to those who have lasted from the campaign until now as “unbroken threads.”She was not originally part of the campaign, but her friends say she has known the president for more than a decade, and has come to understand him and how to speak with him in ways few aides do outside of Ms. Hicks and Keith Schiller, Mr. Trump’s longtime bodyguard, who left the White House last year. For a president hit by crosscurrents on policy, Ms. Conway has frequently been a voice reminding him of his campaign promises.She has called supporters from the final days of the Trump campaign members of the “October 8th coalition,” for defending Mr. Trump after audio of him bragging about sexual assault had leaked.A mother of four who moved her family to Washington last year, Ms. Conway has faced near-constant attack for defending Mr. Trump’s track record with women. But she has also willingly stepped into battle, including when she criticized women for joining the Women’s March the day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration last year.“I frankly didn’t see the point,” Ms. Conway said at the time.But she and her allies say the attacks against her often have a sexist undertone. And she has bristled at a line of thought in liberal spheres and on social media that she and other women have advanced in the White House by keeping their heads down in a misogynistic workplace.“President Trump is more kind, open, gracious and respectful to the women in the White House than the so-called pro-women movement that criticizes everything from what we wear to what we say to what we believe,” Ms. Conway said. “I wouldn’t work there if he weren’t open to my opinion. It would literally make zero sense for me to be there.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/world/europe/state-department-russia-global-engagement-center.html","WASHINGTON — As Russia’s virtual war against the United States continues unabated with the midterm elections approaching, the State Department has yet to spend any of the $120 million it has been allocated since late 2016 to counter foreign efforts to meddle in elections or sow distrust in democracy.As a result, not one of the 23 analysts working in the department’s Global Engagement Center — which has been tasked with countering Moscow’s disinformation campaign — speaks Russian, and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts.The delay is just one symptom of the largely passive response to the Russian interference by President Trump, who has made little if any public effort to rally the nation to confront Moscow and defend democratic institutions. More broadly, the funding lag reflects a deep lack of confidence by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson in his department’s ability to execute its historically wide-ranging mission and spend its money wisely.Mr. Tillerson has voiced skepticism that the United States is even capable of doing anything to counter the Russian threat.“If it’s their intention to interfere, they’re going to find ways to do that,” Mr. Tillerson said in an interview last month with Fox News. “And we can take steps we can take, but this is something that once they decide they are going to do it, it’s very difficult to pre-empt it.”The United States spends billions of dollars on secret cybercapabilities, but these weapons have proved largely ineffective against Russian efforts on Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere that simply amplify or distort divisive but genuine voices in the United States and elsewhere.The role for the Global Engagement Center would be to assess Russian efforts and then set about amplifying a different set of voices to counter them, perhaps creating a network of anti-propaganda projects dispersed around the world, experts said.“There are now thousands of former Russian journalists who have been exiled or fired who are doing counter-Russian stuff in exile who we could help,” said Richard Stengel, who as the under secretary for public diplomacy in the Obama administration had oversight of the Global Engagement Center.Concerted campaigns to highlight the roles of Russian troll farms or Russian mercenaries in Ukraine and Syria could have a profound effect, Mr. Stengel said.At the end of the Obama administration, Congress directed the Pentagon to send $60 million to the State Department so it could coordinate governmentwide efforts, including those by the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security, to counter anti-democratic propaganda by Russia and China. This messaging effort is separate from other potential government actions like cyberattacks.Mr. Tillerson spent seven months trying to decide whether to spend any of the money. The State Department finally sent a request to the Defense Department on Sept. 18 to transfer the funds, but with just days left in the fiscal year, Pentagon officials decided that the State Department had lost its shot at the money.With another $60 million available for the next fiscal year, the two departments dickered for another five months over how much the State Department could have.After The New York Times, following a report on the issue by Politico in August, began asking about the delayed money, the State Department announced on Monday that the Pentagon had agreed to transfer $40 million for the effort, just a third of what was originally intended.State Department officials say they expect to receive the money in April. Steve Goldstein, the under secretary for public diplomacy, said he would contribute $1 million from his own budget to “kick-start the initiative quickly.”“This funding is critical to ensuring that we continue an aggressive response to malign influence and disinformation,” Mr. Goldstein said.On Wednesday, Mark E. Mitchell, a top official in the Defense Department, said much wrangling remained before any of the promised $40 million is transferred to the State Department.“We’re still a ways off,” Mr. Mitchell said.The delays have infuriated some members of Congress, which approved the funding transfer with bipartisan support.“It is well past time that the State Department’s Global Engagement Center gets the resources Congress intended for it to effectively fight Kremlin-sponsored disinformation and other foreign propaganda operations,” Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Wednesday.Adele Ruppe, the center’s chief of staff, defended the administration’s broader efforts to counter Russian propaganda, pointing out that the State Department had provided $1.3 billion in assistance in 2017 to strengthen European resilience to Russian meddling. But that money was largely obligated during the Obama administration, and the Trump administration has proposed slashing that assistance by more than half for the coming year, to $527 million, and to $491 million for the next year.While it waits for the funding transfer from the Pentagon, the center, which has a staff of around 60 people, including 23 contract analysts, will continue working on its original mission: countering jihadist and extremist propaganda.Most of the center’s leaders are working in temporary assignments, a product of Mr. Tillerson’s halt in promotions. The analysts work in a warren of cubicles in the basement of a tired building that once housed the Office of Strategic Services, the World War II predecessor to the C.I.A.The analysts are divided into five teams that largely work in four languages: Arabic, Urdu, French and Somali. The analysts said in interviews that they had notched some significant victories, including a video montage proving that the Islamic State had itself destroyed Al Nuri Grand Mosque in Mosul, Iraq, and a widely seen cartoon in French depicting the miserable life of an Islamic State fighter.Still, these efforts are a small fraction of what Congress envisioned. A 2015 internal assessment found that the Islamic State had been far more nimble on social media than the United States had been. In May, Congress more than doubled the center’s budget, providing an additional $19 million over its earlier budget of $14 million. But by Jan. 1, the department had spent just $3.6 million of the additional $19 million, Mr. Goldstein said.James K. Glassman, the under secretary for public diplomacy during the George W. Bush administration, said the center’s uncertain funding and temporary leadership reflected the administration’s lack of interest in countering either jihadist or Russian propaganda.“They’ve got the vehicle to do this work in the center,” Mr. Glassman said. “What they don’t have is a secretary of state or a president who’s interested in doing this work.”Mr. Tillerson is focusing his energies instead on drastically shrinking the department, leaving a significant part of its budget unused and hundreds of important decisions unmade.Last year, the State Department spent just 79 percent of the money that Congress had authorized for the conduct of foreign affairs, the lowest such level in at least 15 years and well down from the 93 percent spent in the final year of the Obama administration, according to an analysis of data from the Office of Management and Budget.Because of the hiring and promotion freezes that have left large sums unspent, as well as Mr. Tillerson’s refusal to delegate spending decisions, the department had a backlog of more than 1,400 official requests for Mr. Tillerson’s signoff at the end of last year, according to a former senior diplomat who left the department then.
                Eric Schmitt, David E. Sanger and Adam Goldman contributed reporting.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/06/591039154/5-laws-of-political-gravity-in-midterms-do-they-still-apply-in-the-age-of-trump","The 2018 election cycle has officially begun, with the first primaries being held in Texas on Tuesday.In every campaign cycle, analysts look at the fundamentals — the political laws of gravity that, in the past, have influenced elections. In 2016, Donald Trump seemed to defy a lot of these laws, and Republicans are hoping they can do the same this year to prevent the hit the party in power usually takes at this point in a president's first midterm.Here are five laws of political gravity to watch as the 2018 campaign plays out:1. When a president's approval rating is below 50 percent, his party doesn't fare well at allHistorically, parties that hold the White House lose seats in midterms — even more when they also have complete control of Congress, and even more when the president's approval rating is under 50 percent.The Republican Party has a bad news trifecta here.Since the Great Depression, when a president's approval rating has been below 50 percent in his first midterm, his party has lost an average of 41 House and five Senate seats.Midterms are a referendum on the president and his party. Trump is still popular with his base, but because he's so historically unpopular with so many other voters his ability to help his fellow Republicans is diminished. His ""strongly disapprove"" numbers have been consistently higher than his ""strongly approve"" numbers.The latest tracking poll from Gallup showed that 39 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing, while 55 percent disapprove. And his approval rating in the RealClearPolitics average is a similar 40 percent approve, 56 percent disapprove.2. The party with the intensity and enthusiasm on its side winsDemocrats have it — and it's fueled by animus toward President Trump, just like Republicans in 2010 and 2014 were motivated by antipathy to President Obama. (Democrats lost a total of 76 House seats and 15 Senate seats in those two Obama-era midterms.)In the handful of special elections since 2016, and in the Virginia and New Jersey 2017 elections, Democratic turnout has been up. There are hundreds of new Democratic candidates running in races where Democrats have failed to field a candidate in the past, and polls consistently show that Democrats are more interested and enthusiastic about the 2018 campaign than Republicans.As the Washington Post noted Saturday, about 1,200 candidates had registered to run as Democrats for the House by the end of 2017 — a clear record for a single party and the first time since before the wave election of 2010 that Democrats outnumbered Republicans at the same point in an election cycle.3. When people are in a bad mood, the party in power suffersVoters' attitudes about the state of the country — Are we in a recession? Are we at war? — is always one of the most important factors.Americans remain pessimistic about the direction of the country. On average, just 35 percent think the country is headed in the right direction, while 56 percent think it is on the wrong track.And this year, the measurement isn't working the way it usually does in at least one big respect. The direction of the country and a president's approval rating is typically tied to voters' views about the economy. But right now, the economy is doing pretty well — with Americans' attitudes about the economy reaching a 17-year high in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll — and increasing numbers of people are saying they like the GOP tax cuts.So why isn't Trump more popular? In fact, he's suffering poor approval ratings with the very upper-middle class, suburban voters who are probably benefiting the most from his tax cuts.Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report said that it's as if voters are saying to the president, ""Yeah, we feel good about the economy, but we don't really feel good about you.""There is a wild card on the economy — Trump's threatened tariffs and a possible trade war. On Monday, the president said that he didn't think there would be a trade war if he goes ahead with steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, but a few days earlier he tweeted that ""trade wars are good, and easy to win.""Republicans worry Trump's tariffs could undermine the stock market and economic growth — two factors they're counting on to help them in November.4. The party that has the structural advantages can sometimes mitigate damageThis is the bright spot for Republicans.Even though many Democratic candidates have raised impressive amounts of money to stock their war chests, Republicans have a lot more outside money than Democrats do. The Koch Brothers alone have pledged to spend a whopping $400 million electing Republicans this year, 60 percent more than they spent in the 2016 presidential election.Many GOP congressional districts are also drawn to protect incumbents, and because Republicans control more state legislatures, they have overwhelmingly drawn those districts to advantage their party.Republicans are hoping the mighty fortress of redistricting will help them defend against a big blue wave — if one materializes. They are trying to fight back against a state court ruling in Pennsylvania that redrew the state's congressional district and is likely to eat into the GOP's 13-to-5 statewide advantage in House seats. But challenges to maps drawn by Republicans in Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan and North Carolina are unlikely to impact the 2018 election.5. The party that turns out their base usually winsWho actually comes out to vote is an important factor in any election — and it's hard to predict. But it's especially true in midterms, when activists traditionally dominate. Consider: There is about a 30 percent drop off in turnout from presidential to midterm years.In 2016, Donald Trump surprised a lot of political handicappers when he got more rural, white, working-class voters to the polls than most turnout models predicted. And things are often favorable for the GOP in a midterm.""The people who turn out the most tend to be older people, tend to be whiter people, tend to be people who are married, and tend to be people who are well educated,"" says demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution. ""Most of them tend to favor the Republicans.""But there's one flaw in that profile for Republicans — highly educated voters generally do not like Trump. In fact, more than half of white college graduates have strongly disapproved of him. And, since 2016, they have been turning out for Democrats.This will make it harder for Trump to help Republican candidates in the kind of suburban districts won by Hilary Clinton in 2016. The suburbs are precisely where Democrats are hoping to build their comeback. Clinton won 23 districts where a Republican was elected to the House in 2016. Democrats need to pick up a net of 24 seats to take back the House.What's more, Trump won independents in 2016, but they've flipped.To make up for it, Trump needs to turn out big numbers of his white, non-college-educated supporters to the polls this year — just like he did when he defied the odds two years ago.""Coalitions that are built in presidential elections don't always translate into midterm elections,"" Walter points out. ""Just ask Democrats who were counting on the Obama coalition of 2008 to come out in 2010. They didn't."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/591001865/ex-trump-campaign-aide-vows-to-fight-mueller-subpoena-in-tv-tirades","Updated on March 6 at 11:45 a.m. ETA former campaign aide to Donald Trump appears to have changed his mind and will not fight a subpoena he says he has received in the Russia investigation — after daring special counsel Robert Mueller to arrest him in multiple media appearances.Sam Nunberg called reporters and TV news programs on Monday and said live that he'd gotten a grand jury subpoena as part of Mueller's investigation asking for communications with other people in the Trump orbit — but that he won't comply.""Let him arrest me,"" Nunberg told The Washington Post. ""Mr. Mueller should understand I am not going in.""Nunberg then went on multiple MSNBC and CNN shows to publicize his refusal to comply with the Mueller probe. He said he had been summoned to appear before a grand jury on Friday but would not, nor would he produce evidence.What followed was a rambling, at-times incoherent series of exchanges as Nunberg asked for legal advice, opined about whether Trump colluded with Russia, and relitigated an internal Trump campaign power struggle from 2015 — all live, on the air, in real time.""I think that [Trump] may have done something during the election,"" Nunberg told MSNBC's Katy Tur, adding later, ""I don't know that for sure.""""I'm not cooperating,"" Nunberg said. ""Arrest me.""Nunberg is a lawyer who has been admitted to the New York state bar after graduating from Touro Law Center on Long Island, N.Y. All the same, he asked for legal advice from various cable news show hosts: ""What do you think Mueller's going to do to me?"" he asked Tur.""Do you think I should cooperate?"" Nunberg asked CNN's Jake Tapper. ""Why do I have to produce every email? I talk to [former Trump advisers] Steve Bannon and Roger Stone eight times a day.""""Sometimes life and special prosecutors are not fair,"" Tapper quipped.Discussing the request from the Muller team in an interview with the Associated Press later on Monday, Nunberg said he was like ""going to end up cooperating with them.""Nunberg also accused former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page of having played a role in the foreign attack on the election.In the Whitewater investigation during the Clinton administration, an Arkansas business associate of Bill Clinton named Susan McDougal spent 18 months in prison for not complying with a grand jury subpoena. McDougal spoke about Nunberg to the Washington Post on Monday, advising him, ""If you don't want to testify, don't go on television and do these teaser interviews."" ""I believe Carter Page was colluding with the Russians,"" Nunberg said on CNN.Page was a junior foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. He traveled to Moscow twice in 2016 and was the subject of surveillance by the U.S. intelligence community. Page stridently denies doing anything wrong.He and Nunberg never overlapped on the Trump campaign. The Trump campaign fired Nunberg in the summer of 2015, when the Trump candidacy was still in its infancy. Business Insider had written about Nunberg's racially charged Facebook posts from years prior, and the nascent political organization jettisoned him.At the time, Nunberg's firing was viewed as part of a broader struggle between Trump aides Corey Lewandowski and Roger Stone. Nunberg decided to relitigate this on Monday.""Corey wanted to push us out. That's the reality. Now Trump loves Corey. I don't know why he does,"" Nunberg said.By December of that year, Nunberg was saying that Trump's campaign was being led in the wrong direction and predicted that Trump would not win the Republican nomination. By March 2016, Nunberg had endorsed Trump opponent Ted Cruz. The drama continued into the summer of 2016, when Trump sued his former aide for $10 million, alleging Nunberg broke his nondisclosure agreement. After a time, that lawsuit was settled."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/590989957/ailing-mississippi-sen-cochran-to-resign-setting-up-2018-special-election","Updated at 6:02 p.m. ETCiting his ailing health, Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., announced he will resign on April 1, setting up a special election this November. ""I regret my health has become an ongoing challenge,"" Cochran said in a statement Monday. ""I intend to fulfill my responsibilities and commitments to the people of Mississippi and the Senate through the completion of the 2018 appropriations cycle, after which I will formally retire from the U.S. Senate.""Cochran, 80, chairs the Appropriations Committee and has been absent from the Senate for long stretches over the past year, and his resignation does not come as a surprise. However, it does mean that both of Mississippi's Senate seats will be on the ballot come November. According to state law, the remainder of Cochran's term, which expires in 2020, will be filled by a nonpartisan special election in conjunction with the regularly scheduled general election. If no candidate, regardless of party, gets 50 percent, it will go to a December runoff. In the meantime, Republican Gov. Phil Bryant will appoint an interim senator. The state's other senator, Republican Roger Wicker, is also up for re-election this year. He drew a primary challenge last week from state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who previously challenged Cochran in a particularly nasty fight in 2014. McDaniel actually topped Cochran in the first primary election, but failed to get a majority. In the runoff, with the help of crossover Democratic and African-American voters, Cochran prevailed. In a statement later Monday, McDaniel left open the possibly of switching from challenging Wicker to the now-open seat, saying that he would ""continue to monitor developments regarding his replacement and the Special Election that will follow.""""While it is certain that Mississippi will have two U.S. Senate races this year, I am currently focused on my campaign against Roger Wicker, but all options remain on the table as we determine the best way to ensure that Mississippi elects conservatives to the United States Senate,"" McDaniel said. Cochran was first elected to the Senate in 1978 — the first Republican elected statewide then in over 100 years — and had previously served three terms in the House. He leaves as the 10th-longest-serving U.S. senator ever. ""It has been a great honor to serve the people of Mississippi and our country.  I've done my best to make decisions in the best interests of our nation, and my beloved state,"" Cochran said in announcing his decision to step aside. ""My top concern has always been my constituents in Mississippi.  My hope is by making this announcement now, a smooth transition can be ensured so their voice will continue to be heard in Washington, D.C.  My efforts, and those of my staff, to assist them will continue and transfer to my successor.""The Jackson Clarion-Ledger noted that Cochran was a well-liked member of the Senate, dubbed ""Gentleman Thad"" by his fellow legislators, and that he was known for his ""quiet stately demeanor"" and often played ""piano to relax in his office."" Time magazine once called him ""The Quiet Persuader"" for his ability to work across the aisle. His perch atop the powerful Appropriations Committee — which he held during the mid-2000s before regaining it again when Republicans took back the Senate in 2014 — also allowed him to direct projects and money back home to Mississippi, including agricultural aid, funding for universities and federal contracts. That ""bringing home the bacon,"" however, drew the ire of fiscal conservatives and was the reason that many of them supported McDaniel in his 2014 primary challenge. But that same influence also proved critical after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, allowing him to steer billions of dollars to the state. ""The federal relief he helped secure is credited with preventing financial and social ruin in Mississippi and Louisiana after the hurricane's destruction,"" the Clarion-Ledger wrote. Former Gov. Haley Barbour wrote in his book America's Greatest Storm that the way Cochran was able to build bipartisan consensus to deliver aid to the devastated states along the Gulf of Mexico helped save Mississippi. ""On the Senate side, Thad Cochran was in charge, and few if any senators were of a mind to question what he wanted to do for the states hit by Katrina,"" Barbour wrote. ""[Cochran] is a quiet, polite gentleman, but he is tough as nails."" "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/590920670/from-fraud-to-individual-right-where-does-the-supreme-court-stand-on-guns","In the aftermath of the deadly Parkland shooting, attention has focused on legislation that could make its way through Congress and the Florida Legislature.But what does the U.S. Supreme Court have to say about gun control? After a couple of important cases nearly a decade ago, the court has, for the most part, turned away cases challenging gun laws.So why the reluctance, what's the history and is the right to bear arms an absolute one?From a ""fraud"" on the American public to an individual rightFor most of American legal history, the consensus was that the right to bear arms was not an individual right, but rather a right for those called to military service, the militia.Former Chief Justice Warren Burger, a conservative, said the idea that there was an individual right to bear arms was ""a fraud."" If he were writing the Bill of Rights now, he said in 1991, ""There wouldn't be any such thing as the Second Amendment.""He declared on PBS that the Second Amendment ""has been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.""But that all changed with some scholarly work and cases brought by gun rights advocates.In 2008, in District of Columbia v. Heller, the court said there is an individual constitutional right to have a handgun in one's home for self-protection. Two years later, in a second case, the court made clear that its decision applied to the states as well as the federal government.Not an absolute rightThe court has never said, however, that the right to bear arms in this country is absolute.In declaring an individual right to bear arms, the court made clear that there are limitations on that right, just as there are limitations on other constitutional rights.There is a First Amendment right to free speech, but someone can't yell ""fire!"" in a crowded theater. And a person can't parade loudly through a residential area at 2 a.m. either.Similarly, the court said in 2008 that the right to bear arms doesn't bar the government from regulating firearms.The justices specifically said the government can ban firearms for felons or the mentally ill; it can ban guns in sensitive places, like schools and government buildings; and it can impose conditions and qualifications for the commercial sale of guns.In addition, the court also seemed to say that ""particularly dangerous and unusual weapons,"" such as military-style assault weapons, could be prohibited.Why so reluctant?The court has certainly had the opportunity to say more on guns in recent years. But it has turned away numerous gun cases since Heller.Just last month, for example, the court refused to hear a case testing California's 10-day waiting period to buy a gun. Justice Clarence Thomas was the only dissenter, and he accused the court of turning the right to bear arms into a ""disfavored"" constitutional right.Last June, he and Trump-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented when the court refused to hear a challenge to a general ban on concealed-carry weapons outside the home.And in the years before that, the court refused to hear challenges to bans on assault weapons, bans on weapons for someone who is the subject of a protection order in a domestic dispute, and more.There are two cases the court ruled on recently. One was to uphold a law banning a gun for anyone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Justice Thomas dissented from that one, as did Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in part.In 2014, the court by a 5-to-4 vote upheld a strict ban on the straw purchase of firearms —that is if, for instance, someone has a record of domestic violence and wouldn't be allowed to buy a gun, but a family member or friend buys one for that person.And there's no indication the court is anxious to take up more gun cases anytime soon. There are two possible explanations for this continued refusal to act — (1) that the court believes it laid down guidelines in its 2008 Heller decision and would just as soon stay out of this, and (2) more likely, neither side — those justices who believe that the Constitution allows strict gun laws or those who think that such gun control laws are unconstitutional — is sure it has the votes to prevail if the court takes up these issues.After all, Heller was 5 to 4, with Justice Anthony Kennedy the deciding vote. And it has long been assumed that the caveats in the decision were the price of his vote.There is, of course, a third possible explanation for the failure to take up gun cases: that some justices, especially in light of current circumstances, have evolving views on this subject."

You can barely buy a two-room apartment for less than 2 million shekels. (That's about $577,000).What's any of this got to do with U.S. politics? At a meeting at the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump told reporters that he had rejected a $1 billion plan to build a new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. Instead, he's going to build one for just $250,000.What a deal!But that's not quite the whole story.What did Trump say?Here's what Trump said in full about the cost of the new embassy with Netanyahu by his side:Trump quickly added: ""Now, it's temporary, but it'll be very nice.""He then boasted: ""$250,000 versus a billion dollars.""Turning to an already laughing Netanyahu, he asked rhetorically, ""Is that good?""What was Trump talking about?We checked it out. Is the United States somehow building ""it,"" as in a permanent embassy, for $250,000?No.Trump was probably conflating two things: a permanent new embassy to be built years from now and a temporary embassy office the U.S. is building inside an existing consular building in Jerusalem to be set up by May, NPR diplomacy correspondent Michele Kelemen and international correspondent Daniel Estrin, based in Jerusalem, report.""Internal modifications to allow the embassy to open in an existing facility in May is anticipated to cost $200,000 to $400,000,"" a State Department official tells Kelemen.As for financing the permanent embassy, The Associated Press reported in late February:In January, Trump chafed at the $1 billion cost of the new U.S. Embassy in London. He canceled a trip to London for a ribbon-cutting because he said it was a ""bad deal.""The U.S. Embassy in London remarkably put out a statement defending itself, as NPR's Frank Langfitt reported."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/06/591077604/netanyahu-details-his-talk-with-trump-on-iran-and-palestinians","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed his Oval Office meeting with President Trump, offering praise for the U.S. leader's knowledge about Iran, but dodging questions over investigations Netanyahu faces back home.The prime minister does not grant many interviews to reporters based in Israel — except to those reporters who travel with him abroad.Between his Oval Office meeting and his keynote address Tuesday before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Netanyahu sat with a couple dozen reporters at a large round table Monday in the president's official guest house across the street from the White House, and took questions.Back in Israel, Netanyahu and his spokespeople have given up most traditional media interviews in favor of Facebook missives and videos. But on trips abroad, the prime minister tends to brief Israeli journalists and Israel-based international reporters who travel with him. On his trip this week to Washington, D.C., are reporters from NPR, The New York Times, The Washington Post and the major Israeli outlets.The conversation was Israeli-style: freewheeling, uninhibited and pushy. There was a lively debate among journalists and spokespeople about the ground rules of what would be off the record.Initially, the atmosphere was tense. Netanyahu declined to address on record Monday's explosive news in Israel — that his confidant and former media adviser Nir Hefetz agreed to cooperate with police as a witness for the state and offer testimony in corruption cases Netanyahu faces.Israeli media reported Hefetz would testify that Netanyahu's son and wife interfered in his decision-making on matters of national security. Hefetz is the third Netanyahu confidant to make a deal with authorities to provide information for their corruption probes in exchange for a promise of lesser punishment.Netanyahu's spokesman raised questions about the police's recruitment of state's witnesses, and Netanyahu himself has accused police investigators of a plot to frame him.NPR asked Netanyahu to respond to criticism that by raising doubts about the police's motives he was attacking the Israeli democratic institution of law enforcement. Netanyahu said he was ""not willing to answer"" and did not accept the ""premises"" of the question.Netanyahu said his police investigations did not come up in his meeting with Trump. In response to a question from NPR about a Washington Post report that Israel was among four countries seeking to take advantage of Jared Kushner to gain leverage, Netanyahu said the matter did not arise in their discussion and declined to comment further.The prime minister steered the conversation to his meeting with Trump, which lasted 2.5 hours, according to his office. The central issue Netanyahu raised, he said, was: ""Iran, Iran and Iran.""""The president is very knowledgeable about Iran,"" Netanyahu said. ""He has impressive knowledge of the details.""Trump faces a May deadline to decide whether to impose nuclear sanctions on Iran again, which would effectively render the U.S. as pulling out of the Iranian nuclear agreement.""The president will decide whether to renew the agreement,"" Netanyahu said. ""He was very interested in my estimations and my recommendations."" His advice: ""Fully fix, or get rid of it, fully nix. This is what I told him.""He said the two leaders discussed the Palestinians. As for Trump's long-anticipated peace proposal, Netanyahu said he ""did not see a draft"" during Monday's meeting. But he would not say whether he has seen a draft before.When asked if he believed in the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — establishing Palestine alongside Israel — Netanyahu said, ""I haven't named it. But I've defined it."" He said Israel did not seek to govern the Palestinians but that Israel must retain overriding security control of the West Bank, which Palestinians seek for a state, arguing that the Palestinians are not capable of rooting out violence.""There is no ability by the Palestinians to deal with these things. Who does the job is the Israeli security forces,"" Netanyahu said. ""You can say it will be good if we give them a state ... empirically it doesn't work with what we see.""The Palestinians have suggested an international monitoring force in the West Bank in the event of a Palestinian state — but refuse to accept any Israeli military presence long term.In a nod to his upcoming speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington on Tuesday, Netanyahu addressed a question about Israel becoming increasingly a polarizing and partisan issue in the U.S., especially among American Jews.Liberal streams of Judaism, which are dominant in the U.S., say they are discriminated against in Israel, and complain about Netanyahu tabling a decision to build an official mixed-gender prayer space at the Western Wall, the Jewish holy site in Jerusalem. Netanyahu said the move faces ultra-Orthodox opposition and ""I am trying to unjam it."" Netanyahu pledged there would be an upgraded prayer space there.""I want every Jew to be comfortable in Israel,"" Netanyahu said.Later Israeli reporters bantered with Netanyahu about television, and Netanyahu offered a TV recommendation: Big Blue Live, a PBS wildlife documentary.""Big Blue — you have to see it. It's amazing,"" he told reporters."

Steve Lebsock, who is accused of sexually harassing or intimidating at least nine legislators, staffers and lobbyists, as NPR member station KUNC first reported in November.And as the vote on Lebsock's fate approached, two legislators who had been vocal in advocating for the accusers began taking additional steps to protect themselves.""I bought a bulletproof vest,"" Assistant Majority Leader Alec Garnett told the chamber on Friday, tearing up. ""And I'm wearing it. It's right here.""He patted his chest.""I'm wearing Kevlar,"" he said. ""Because I fear for retaliation. I am in the chamber of the House of Representatives, and I'm wearing a bulletproof vest because I fear retaliation for telling the truth and standing up for victims of sexual harassment. I've been wearing it for three weeks.""Garnett, a Democrat, told The Denver Post that he was specifically worried about the potential for violence from Lebsock, who he said had threatened to ""take [him] down.' ""He said he had stopped buttoning up his shirt or tying his tie before getting to work.""Because once I get in here I have to put on my bulletproof vest, because my wife doesn't want to see me put it on,"" Garnett explained. ""So I walk into my office. There's a sign that says 'Harassment Free.' And I put on my bulletproof vest. And I button up my shirt and I go into the members' bathroom and I tie my tie.""Rep. Matt Gray, also a Democrat, told the chamber he had started wearing one of the vests, too.""I put mine on in the parking garage so my kids don't have to see and I don't have to explain to them what it is,"" he said.The Post reports that Lebsock cried as he replied to hearing about the vests.""Members,"" he said. ""I am an honorably discharged Marine Corps veteran. And if someone walked in here — members, you would have had me here to protect you. Even the ones that don't like me. I'm just hoping you know that.""A Republican member of the House, Lori Saine, told KUNC's Bente Birkeland recently that many in her party's caucus carry concealed guns in the Capitol, which she said makes her feel secure.But Democratic Rep. Jonathan Singer told KUNC he thought guns in the Capitol were a bad idea.""When you enter a government building, when there are heated vigorous debates and people are on edge, sleep deprived and — you know, let's be honest — there are people in this building who are drinking, that is a deadly mix,"" said Singer.Democratic Rep. Faith Winter was the first to file an official complaint of misconduct against Lebsock, who she says made aggressive and angry unwanted sexual advances toward her at a party celebrating the end of the 2016 legislative session. She decided to come forward with the allegations after learning that other women said they'd experienced similar harassment from Lebsock, suggesting a pattern of behavior.""The women in the building are going to be believed,"" Winter told Colorado Public Radio after the vote to expel Lebsock. ""They felt that their voices were heard and valued, and I think it's going to change the culture there.""Though some Republicans argued that expulsion was a ""nuclear option"" that appropriated the will of the voters, many members shared emotional stories of harassment, abuse or rape that they or their loved ones have experienced.Lebsock, who is still a candidate for state treasurer, left the chamber after his expulsion. Only later did members learn that minutes before his departure, he changed his affiliation to Republican — making it possible for the GOP to fill his now-vacant seat."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/590877835/congressional-republicans-lobby-trump-to-back-down-on-tariffs","Updated at 3:00 p.m. ETFears of economic and political backlash are motivating senior congressional Republicans to move forward this week with public and private lobbying efforts aimed at getting President Trump to change his mind about tariffs he intends to levy on steel and aluminium imports.""We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan,"" AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement. ""The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don't want to jeopardize those gains.""President Trump downplayed congressional GOP concerns. ""I don't think you're going to have a trade war,"" he said Monday at the White House, where he defended his decision to crack down on imports. ""People have to understand, our country on trade, has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world whether it's friend or enemy. Everybody.""The president noted that his efforts to renegotiate NAFTA continue as well. ""We are renegotiating NAFTA as I said I would, and if we don't make a deal I will terminate NAFTA,"" he warned.Congress is not ruling out possible legislative action to counter Trump's actions, although party leaders have no immediate plans to act if the president moves forward this week as stated with imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports.Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, and the panel's trade subcommittee chairman, David Reichert, R-Wash., have also drafted a letter to the president outlining concerns about new tariffs. They are seeking additional signatures from House Republicans. Aides said lawmakers were hoping to avoid a confrontation with the administration and instead work with the president to enact trade policies the broader GOP can get behind.""As the two chairmen have reinforced, the administration and Congress must work together on trade policies that build off the momentum of the president's tax cuts, which is why any tariffs should be narrow, targeted, and focused on addressing unfairly traded products, without disrupting the flow of fairly traded products for American businesses and consumers,"" Lauren Aronson, a spokeswoman for the Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement.Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is also expected to send a letter to the president this week asking him to reconsider his position. Hatch opposes new tariffs because he believes they will undermine any economic boost delivered by the GOP's tax cuts. ""Should the administration opt to move forward with tariffs on steel and aluminum, American manufacturers, businesses, and consumers would be forced to bear the brunt paying more for steel and steel products. Such action could very well undercut the benefits of the pro-growth tax reform we fought to get on the books,"" Hatch said in a weekend statement.The White House showed no indication Monday that the president was considering changing his mind. ""The president is resolute about this, and no one should be surprised either at that resoluteness or the fact that it's going to happen,"" said National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro, a top Trump aide who, along with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, has been the strongest administration advocate for new tariffs.""Understand that all the rhetoric that's being generated about this is being generated by the lobbyists on K Street and the politicians who are fundamentally opposed to what the president wants to do on behalf of the American worker and on behalf of the country,"" Navarro said. ""This is a very well-informed decision.""Trump's decision is the starkest break from traditional GOP economic philosophy on trade since taking office. The president has found few GOP allies on Capitol Hill, but Rust Belt Democrats up for re-election this year cheered the administration's decision. ""This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,"" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. Likewise, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., called Trump's decision a ""welcome step.""Republicans were frustrated and taken by surprise by the timing of the president's announcement last week that steel and aluminum tariffs were imminent. Republicans generally support a more targeted approach to pushing back on cheap foreign imports — a message they delivered directly to Trump in several recent meetings. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, one of the top Republicans in the Senate, was among those who were caught off guard last week when Trump made the announcement.""I don't know how to explain it because I've been in meetings with him on trade,"" Thune told reporters. ""Everybody's been very clear that we think some of the decisions that they're talking about making and policies they're talking about implementing would be very harmful to the economy at a time when it's really taking off.""Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has argued that a blanket tariff fails to directly punish countries like China for dumping low-cost steel in the American market. Graham said Sunday that Trump would ""let China off the hook"" while punishing U.S. companies that sell goods abroad by inviting retaliatory tariffs from other global trading partners. ""The reason our steel industry has been decimated is because of China dumping,"" Graham said in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation. ""China produces more steel than the world consumes for several years in a row. China is your problem, Mr. President.""Congress technically has legislative options to counter Trump's tariffs if he moves ahead with them despite opposition, but it would require a somewhat extraordinary move on the part of Republicans to craft legislation cracking down on their own president in an election year. Republicans would also likely need vetoproof majorities in both chambers to have any effect. And any legislative move would also upend orthodoxy on trade policy, which is generally enacted with the view that the president should be given latitude to manage international trade."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/590296136/robert-muellers-pace-measures-up-with-best-prosecutors-in-modern-history","The man leading the Justice Department's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election has been keeping busy.Special counsel Robert Mueller has been on the job for about nine months. But he has already charged 19 people with wrongdoing — and won guilty pleas from the president's former campaign vice chairman and his former national security adviser.Scholars who focus on politically charged investigations that may lead into the White House have been taking note.""Robert Mueller's pace in this investigation really is very similar to some of the best special prosecutors in modern history,"" said Ken Gormley, the president of Duquesne University and the author of two books on special prosecutors.These investigations carry special burdens: to move forward quietly, with no leaks, and quickly, to prove guilt or innocence.""The whole point of appointing an independent counsel in these kind of instances is to deal with the fact that there's a cloud over the highest levels of the executive branch and to restore public confidence, one way or the other,"" Gormley said.For many people, the model prosecutor was Archibald Cox, who investigated Watergate for a little more than a year before he was fired.""I'm not looking for a confrontation,"" Cox told reporters in 1973. ""I've worried a good deal through my life about the problems of imposing too much strain upon our constitutional institutions and I'm certainly not out to get the president of the United States.""During his tenure, Cox developed evidence about obstruction of justice by President Richard Nixon. The prosecutor who replaced Cox built on that work, ultimately leading to Nixon's resignation.Gormley said the current special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, is operating in that same mold.But at the White House, President Trump and his lawyers have been pressing the Mueller team to move faster. So is another familiar figure: former Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr.""The American people, I think, want to know, was there collusion,"" Starr told CNN last week. ""Let's get that answered. That would be my sense, if I were at the Justice Department.""Starr spent five years and more than $40 million investigating President Bill Clinton. Critics say Starr took too long and wandered away from his original mission. He was far from the only independent counsel to come under attack as a ""roving Frankenstein monster,"" Gormley said.In the category of ""no end,"" there was the investigation of Clinton's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry Cisneros. In 1995, then-Attorney General Janet Reno asked for an independent counsel to determine whether Cisneros should face prosecution for providing false information about payments to a former mistress.""I'm disappointed by that outcome but I'm hopeful that the investigation will be completed expeditiously,"" Cisneros told reporters at the time.But any hope Cisneros had for a speedy resolution went bust. The independent counsel in his case, David Barrett, kept working even after the law authorizing his work expired. Cisneros pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was later pardoned by the president. Still, Barrett's work continued. The final report emerged in 2006, nearly 11 years after he took office.Robert Mueller is a hard-driving former FBI director, not known for dallying in his work. He's already secured indictments against Russians for running an information warfare campaign aimed at the last presidential election.And yet, Wake Forest University professor Katy Harriger said measuring Mueller's success will be a challenge.""For some people, success will only be if somehow the president gets impeached,"" Harriger said. ""And for other people, success is a complete exoneration.""Push away that cloud of politics, she said, and success may be a report or a set of conclusions that most people can believe."

But by the time the candidate bounces through the door, they're unfolding dozens more chairs as the crowd zooms past 100.O'Rourke, who currently represents the El Paso area in the U.S. House, is running for the chance to unseat the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz. No Democrat has represented the Lone Star State in the Senate since 1993, but O'Rourke believes he can beat the odds, in part by campaigning aggressively in every part of this sprawling state.""Of the 254 counties [in Texas], we've visited 226 so far. This is 226 today,"" O'Rourke tells the crowd, who have been chanting, ""Beto, Beto!""O'Rourke has his work cut out for him. A recent Texas Politics Project poll showed nearly 40 percent of Texas voters have no idea who he is.But county by county, O'Rourke is slowly getting his name out with crowded, grass-roots events like the one in Pittsburg.""I love Beto, I came out to see him. I've probably seen him eight times. He stands for everything that Ted Cruz doesn't and I think he's the real deal,"" said retired teacher Barbara Rosel.O'Rourke's substantial fundraising has also drawn notice.""In the first 45 days of this year we raised $2.3 million with an average online contribution of 25 bucks,"" said O'Rourke as he spoke to NPR while sitting down for lunch at a Pittsburg restaurant called Hot Links. Cruz raised about $800,000 during the same period. ""I just haven't seen this kind of excitement and energy and willingness to do what it takes in Texas in my life,"" O'Rourke added.That fundraising may help him make up for the lack of awareness Texas voters have of the Democrat, according to Texas Tribune executive editor and political analyst Ross Ramsey. ""I think he'll have enough money, whether they vote red or blue in November, Texans will know who Beto O'Rourke really is,"" Ramsey told NPR.O'Rourke is capitalizing on an extremely restive Democratic electorate. Although Texas Democrats have been largely shut out of statewide office for the past two decades, they've been closing the gap with Republicans. In 2016, Hillary Clinton got 600,000 more votes in Texas than Barack Obama did just four years earlier. President Trump won the state by about 9 percent.O'Rourke says the president has a lot to do with the energy among Democrats.""They're coming out because they don't want a wall [with Mexico]. People are coming out because they don't want to hear the president refer to the countries of Africa as 's***hole' nations,"" said O'Rourke. ""People are coming out because they don't think the press is the enemy of the people, they think they're the best defense against tyranny. People are coming out because they want women to be treated with dignity and respect.""The tall, thin 45-year-old sometimes gets described as a West Texas version of John F. Kennedy. But it's O'Rourke's unabashed liberalism and earnest delivery that makes Democrats swoon.At the Pittsburg event, O'Rourke criticized the state's decision to shut down family planning clinics, arguing it has resulted in sky-high maternal mortality rates. In a state where guns are sometimes seen as a birthright, he argues for universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.O'Rourke has two challengers in this Tuesday's Democratic primary, but had a 50 point lead in the latest polling.This fall, it's likely O'Rourke will face Ted Cruz in the general election. Although Cruz's reputation with Republican voters suffered when he refused to endorse Donald Trump's nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention, he is an accomplished fundraiser and formidable opponent.Cruz's campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but Cruz is taking the race seriously.He recently warned Houston-area Republicans: ""The left is going to show up. They will crawl over broken glass in November to vote.""Early voting numbers in Tuesday's Texas primaries show that Democrats have more than doubled their numbers from the same point in the 2014 midterms, while Republicans are up only 15 percent, according to David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report.Ramsey warns that it's easy to read too much into early vote totals, since they may just indicate Democrats are taking advantage of the convenience of early voting. The final turnout on Tuesday will be a better indication of where things sit.""It's still a Republican state. It would take a lot of things to fall in place, but that said, up to this date O'Rourke has a lot of things going for him,"" Ramsey said.He added that many Texas political observers are reminding themselves that they saw the rise of another long-shot Senate candidate six years ago.His name was Ted Cruz."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/04/590313279/ahead-of-texas-primary-early-signs-of-a-2018-democratic-surge","Updated on March 5 at 7:13 p.m. ET The 2018 primary elections kick off this week, and Democrats are already seeing reasons to be excited deep in the red, beating heart of Texas.The Lone Star State holds the nation's first primary on Tuesday, and in the 11 days of early voting Democrats reached record levels in a midterm year. They surpassed GOP early voting turnout this year and their own party's numbers during the same period in 2016, a presidential election year where voting numbers are typically much higher, and more than doubled their turnout from the last midterm election in 2014.The rising Democratic enthusiasm mirrors what the party has already seen across the country in the nearly year and a half since President Trump was elected — more than three dozen state legislature seats changing hands, important wins in Virginia and New Jersey last year and mobilization through rallies and protests.Texas's primary brings the first actual voting in the 2018 midterm cycle, giving both parties a chance for a more concrete measure ahead of November's elections. Early signs of such a swell in a bulwark red state could be an even more ominous sign for Republicans nationally this fall if it's borne out by Tuesday's results.""Texas is the nation's bellwether right now,"" said Tariq Thowfeek, the communications director for the Texas Democratic Party. ""It's a good gauge of the incredible progressive energy we have across the country in a state that is ranked at the bottom of the barrel in voter turnout.""The Cook Political Report's David Wasserman found that in the top 15 counties in the state, the Democratic early vote had spiked 105 percent over 2014 numbers. On the Republican side, there had been only a 15 percent uptick.A surge in Democrats on the ballot It's not just an uptick in Democratic voters happening in Texas, but an increase in candidates putting their names on the ballot, too. Democrats are fielding a modern-day record number of candidates across the state. There are 111 U.S. House candidates running for the minority party, and they are spread across all 36 Texas congressional districts — the first time that's happened in 25 years, and a departure from two years ago when Democrats didn't run candidates in eight seats.On a state legislative level, Democrats have candidates in 132 of the 150 state House districts and in 14 of the 15 state Senate districts up for election this year. That includes four Senate districts where Democrats didn't field candidates in 2014 or 2012, and 20 new House districts where they didn't have candidates in either 2016, 2014 or 2012.Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, said that the Democratic surge is even more impressive given that it's usually GOP voters, not Democrats, who have been reliable in non-presidential years.""It's one word — enthusiasm. In a midterm election like this, what you normally expect to see is the Republicans' primary turnout might be twice what the Democratic turnout is, so to have the Democrats even with, and even slightly ahead, of Republicans in this midterm election is really extraordinary,"" Jillson said.Key suburban swing districts are likely to determine control of the House in 2018. There are several GOP-held districts like that which could be at play in Texas, such as Rep. Pete Sessions's suburban Dallas seat and Rep. John Culberson's suburban Houston district, which, along with Rep. Will Hurd's expansive border district that runs from San Antonio to El Paso, all voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016.""Going into this year, there was an expectation following the Women's March, in the wake of the elections in New Jersey and Virginia and all these special elections that something similar was likely to happen in the first-in-the-nation Texas primary, and I think it has,"" SMU's Jillson said. ""It signals a Democratic electorate that is motivated to make a statement against Donald Trump, and that motivation is nowhere more powerful than in female voters.""There's been a downside to the Democrats' surge of candidates in some places, however. In the primary to face Culberson, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently lobbed attacks against one candidate they didn't feel would be a strong challenger given past derisive comments about places in the state. That move prompted a backlash from some progressive groups and criticism from the head of the Democratic National Committee.Matt Angle, a longtime Texas Democratic strategist and director of the Lone Star Project, said the sheer number of candidates was still a positive thing for Democrats in a state where they've had trouble recruiting in the past, and noted that other primaries have been more civil. Those are encouraging signs, he said, for the way the state is trending politically.""Make no mistake — it's a tough lift in Texas. It's a state still that is a right of center state, but I'm very encouraged,"" Angle said. ""The excitement being generated now among candidates will not only build, it will consolidate.""Backlash to Trump President Trump under-performed past GOP presidential nominees in the state, carrying it in 2016 by only single digits, and a Gallup poll released at the end of January showed that the president's approval rating in Texas had dropped below 40 percent.While Trump's approval among Republican base voters remains strong, that dissatisfaction with the president is certainly driving Democratic turnout and convincing more disaffected voters to turn blue, Angle argued. For example, that has helped Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke in his upstart campaign to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. While O'Rourke still remains an underdog, he's been drawing large crowds and has even outraised Cruz recently with the help of small-dollar donors.""In Texas, I think what you do have a chance to do is build a really strong coalition of Democrats, independents and fair-minded Republicans who are disillusioned with the type of leadership they're getting,"" Angle said.Texas GOP strategist Derek Ryan pointed out that Democrats do have some major statewide primaries, such as the gubernatorial race, that could be driving some turnout, but admitted that Democrats have done a good job of recruiting candidates across the board, thus making those competitive races more appealing to some voters.Ryan also acknowledged that the rise in Democratic enthusiasm is worrisome for Republicans — especially because Democrats have gotten many low propensity voters to the polls. He's been diving into the early voting data, and his analysis found that many of those primary voters are ones that voted in 2016 — but haven't had a proclivity to vote yet in a midterm year when turnout typically drops off. And nearly a quarter of Democrats who cast early ballots were new voters who just registered in the past two years.On the GOP side, Ryan found that first-time primary voters only made up about 11 percent of the early vote share, which is a dip from the 2014 midterm primaries. However, on the Democratic side, first time primary voters comprise over nearly a quarter of the early vote — way up from the 14 percent four years ago.""While I don't think that Texas is going to turn blue this cycle, I do think with these turnout numbers, it could have a significant impact in some races, and some leaning Republican races in November,"" Ryan said.Matt Mackowiak, another Republican strategist in the state and chairman of the Travis County GOP, argued that the true test of Democratic enthusiasm will be on Tuesday night. He pointed out that early voting numbers also looked strong for Clinton back in 2016, but that was her high watermark and Election Day voting couldn't match Republican totals.""For Republicans, if this is evidence of a significant enthusiasm gap, then that would be something to worry about,"" Mackowiak said. ""I'm not sure that it is yet, and just because you have stronger turnout in the primary doesn't mean it translates into Election Day vote in November.""But he admitted that the early numbers should give Republicans some pause and they certainly don't hold any good news if the trend continues on Tuesday.""There's no way to look at this as positive for Republicans — it's either inconsequential, or it's bad,"" Mackowiak said."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/03/590583598/before-trump-announced-tariffs-icahn-sold-off-millions-in-steel-related-stocks","Updated at 5:20 p.m. ETA former adviser to President Trump sold off $31.3 million in stocks he owned in a steel-dependent company, just days before the president announced hefty tariffs on foreign-made steel.Carl Icahn, a billionaire investor and Trump's former ""special adviser to the president on regulatory reform,"" sold the shares between Feb. 12 and Feb. 22, according to an SEC filing that was first reported on by the left-leaning website ThinkProgress.The shares Icahn sold, in the Manitowoc Company, have lost value fairly steadily over the past month but took another tumble Thursday and Friday after Trump announced that he would impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel.Manitowoc is a global manufacturer of cranes and is therefore highly dependent on steel. Reuters mentioned that the company's stock fell more than 6 percent Thursday in a story about how companies around the world were reacting to the tariff announcement.Icahn sold the stock for between $32 and $34 a share in February, but the price of a share at market close on Friday was $26.93. The sale represented roughly a third of Icahn's total ownership stake in the company, according to CNBC.""After the trades, Icahn owned 4.85 percent of the company, down from his previous stake of 7.5 percent,"" CNBC's Tae Kim reported. The resulting 4.85 percent stake means Icahn does not have to report further sales of the company's stock to the SEC, according to The Street.Before last month, Icahn had not been active with the Manitowoc stocks in years, reported The Washington Post. The last time he traded it was in January 2015.In February, however, he began selling his shares in the company before the public knew a steel tariff could be on the immediate horizon. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced that he was recommending the tariff to the president on Feb. 16.Icahn has not commented publicly about the trades and has not responded to requests for comment by NPR, made on Saturday.On Friday, a White House spokesman dismissed the idea that the president would have fed Icahn any insider information, pointing to the fact that Trump has long said both publicly and privately that he wanted to impose tariffs.Icahn told CNBC in an interview on Thursday that he hadn't ""had much interaction with [Trump] at all in the past four or five months.""The $31 million represents a drop in the bucket of Icahn's vast wealth. He ranks No. 27 on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans for 2017, with an estimated net worth of nearly $17 billion.From virtually the moment Trump named him an adviser to deal with ""the strangling regulations that our country is faced with,"" Icahn faced questions about how the policies he advocated for would help his finances.He advocated for policies and vetted two Cabinet nominees, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton, as NPR's Peter Overby reported, despite owning an oil refinery company with a significant stake in policies mandated by the EPA and a large stake in a company that was being investigated by the SEC.He ended up quitting the position in August 2017, just hours before The New Yorker published a long article detailing his conflicts of interest.""I never had access to nonpublic information or profited from my position,"" Icahn wrote in his letter announcing his resignation from the role, ""nor do I believe that my role presented conflicts of interest.""The decades-long relationship between Trump and Icahn ""is one of friends turned foes turned friends,"" the Post reported. The two businessmen have known each other since the 1980s and had business dealings related to the Taj Mahal casino beginning in the 1990s, according to the Post.NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith contributed to this report."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/04/590660482/at-gridiron-dinner-trump-trades-jabs-with-his-opposition-party","Updated at 2:15 p.m. ETPresident Trump suited up in white tie and tails for an evening of levity and charm Saturday with his cordial hosts, the journalists he has affectionately referred to as ""the enemy of the American people"" — and had, as recently as a few hours beforehand, described as ""being mocked all over the world."" The journalists organizing the event, for their part, served up skits for him and a few pointed jabs at his administration.All in attendance dined on a three-course meal, laid out with ""Fake Menus.""Welcome to the Gridiron Club and Foundation's 2018 spring dinner. Here, in the crowded basement ballroom of a swanky D.C. hotel, the mockery is at least kind of the point: For 133 years, journalists have invited a constellation of Washington's bright stars in media and politics to reach across whatever distances divide them for a good verbal kick in the shin — and a hearty laugh about it together.You can see how this might get weird.""I know the Gridiron is really an old tradition in Washington — been around a long time, and one that's important to many of you in the media,"" Trump told the journalists gathered in the room, whom he termed his ""opposition party"" at one point in his half-hour comedy set. ""So I was very excited to receive this invitation to come here and ruin your evening in person.""Trump takes the stageIt was just the latest Gridiron invitation accepted by a U.S. president, all but one of whom have attended the ritzy, closed-door dinner since the elite media organization's founding in 1885. (We're casting a stern eye in your direction, Grover Cleveland.)But it's fair to say this time felt different: Trump famously turned down Washington's high-profile political media schmoozefests during his first year in office, not only rejecting the Gridiron but the White House Correspondents Dinner last year, as well. In fact, to this point, the only media gala Trump has planned to take part in during his young presidency was one of his own creation, The Highly-Anticipated 2017 Fake News Awards, and that turned out to be a Web page.Still, standing behind the podium and flanked by a minor pantheon of Cabinet members and aides, Trump appeared to relish the opportunity to let loose, training his fire on just about everyone during the roast-style event.There was his son-in-law seated to his left, Jared Kushner: ""You know, we were late tonight because Jared could not get through security.""His treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, sitting to his right: ""America has a proud history of treasury secretaries who sponsored the arts. Alexander Hamilton gave us so much. Andrew Mellon famously gave us the National Gallery — a tremendous gift. Steve has given us the blockbuster movie Lego Batman.""There was Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a favorite object of Trump's biting comments on Twitter, getting one this time in person: ""You know, it's weird, I offered him a ride over — and he recused himself!""Then he turned to his senior adviser Stephen Miller and wife, Melania.""I like turnover,"" he said. ""Now the question everybody keeps asking is, who is going to be the next to leave, Steve Miller or Melania?""""That is terrible, honey — but you love me, right?"" he added, turning to his wife as the joke was greeted with gasps from the audience. And after she mouthed something off-mic, he said to the crowd: ""I won't tell you what she said.""The governing rule behind the evening's roast-style comedy — as laid out by Gridiron President David Lightman at the start of the night — was to ""singe, not burn."" It was guidance Trump observed ... for the most part. To muddy a beloved adage: He reserved the brunt of his heat for some of the absent figures who had stayed out of the kitchen — such as his former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who Trump called one of CNN's ""true stars, the guy who got you the most scoops and inside info.""That included apparently ad libbed broadsides lobbed at former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (""man, she's crazy — but she's a fine woman""), former Vice President Joe Biden (""trust me, I would kick his ass"") and Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election: ""What is he, on some committee? That's the only thing he doesn't know, is what committee — because he's on the phone so much, he doesn't have any time. Hey!""And then he turned to Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California."" 'He must be impeached!' That's all she knows how to say,"" Trump told the crowd. ""And I say — and I get in trouble for this — 'she has to immediately take an IQ test,' and people go crazy.""""There's so much hatred,"" he added a few seconds later. ""We have to stop the hatred.""Building bridges with North Korea?At one point deep in Trump's set, a moment of genuine policy appeared to glimmer through the cloud of quips and digs — though whether that moment was to be taken seriously or lightly remains unclear.""I won't rule out direct talks with [North Korean dictator] Kim Jong Un — I just won't. As far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned, that's his problem, not mine,"" he said. ""He must be a fine man — do you think he's a fine man?""Late last month the South Korean leadership said North Korea was open to dialogue with the U.S., potentially dialing down the tensions that have simmered between the two countries in recent months. Trump himself has traded barbs with Kim throughout much of his presidency.""They, by the way, called up a couple of days ago. They said, 'We would like to talk.' And I said, 'So would we, but you have to denuke,' "" Trump said, shifting his tone.""Maybe positive things are happening now,"" he added. ""I hope that's true. I say that in all seriousness: I hope that's true.""Trump seemed happy with his performance at the dinner, tweeting early Sunday afternoon, ""The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something, and especially since this is for the American People!""Building walls with the warm-up actsTrump, of course, was but the closer. The sets and sketches before him teemed with other high-profile figures thrust into unfamiliar roles.""We practiced very hard for things that don't come naturally to us,"" said Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, referring to his wife, Anna Peckham. ""For me, comedy speech; for Anna, laughing at my jokes.""Cotton represented the GOP side of the aisle with his set, following the Democratic mayor of New Orleans, Mitch Landrieu. Encouraged by the fact Trump accepted the Gridiron invitation, Landrieu extended one of his own to the president: Come to the Big Easy, which has ""everything Donald Trump likes and talks about.""Parades, for instance — and walls.""You like walls. We've got one of those. It's called the levee,"" Landrieu said. ""Too much public leaking goes on during Mardi Gras all the time. Gold: we've got that too. There are enough gold doubloons in the city of New Orleans you could literally write your name across a building in huge gold letters. Not that anybody would want to do that.""And all the while — before, between and after the two politicians' sets — the journalists of the Gridiron Club carried out another tradition, dressing up and performing musical skits swiping broadly at politicians and themselves. Lifting the tunes to popular standards and swapping in some barbed lyrics of their own, not unlike the Capitol Steps, reporters and anchors traded in their gravitas for some amateur theatrics.Speaking of weirdness, it's not often the common viewer gets a good look at [name redacted, to protect professional dignity] in a silver sequined tuxedo; [yup, these are redacted too] giving Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" dance an honest, if imperfect try; and [you'd better believe this one's redacted] dancing in a peacock suit to the belted tones of a Carly Simon satire.""You're so vain,"" sang the pantsuited ladies in front of the dancing peacock as one woman, dressed as Hillary Clinton, crooned: ""Why can't you let this show be about me? I'm in pain! For 30 years the show's been about me.""In the end, though, this show was about Trump — or ""King Chaos,"" as Landrieu attempted to christen him. ""I mean, if it fits.""""I like chaos,"" Trump said in his own set. ""It really is good.""And he closed the night of sparring with one final haymaker.""I do want to say this is one of the best times I can ever remember having with the media,"" he said. ""This might be the most fun I've had since watching your faces on election night."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/03/590475332/a-week-lost-in-the-west-wing-reality-show","Updated at 9:43 a.m. ETIn the annals of tumultuous weeks for the still-young Trump presidency, there may not have been a more chaotic one than this, outside of his reaction to and the fallout from the summer's racist violence in Charlottesville, Va.""The chaos at the White House seems to be getting worse,"" said Alex Conant, a former spokesman at the Republican National Committee and senior adviser to Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. ""The constant staff turnover and the inability to turn the page on negative stories makes it impossible to push a positive agenda. There is really good work being done by this administration at the agency level, but it gets lost in the West Wing reality show.""Think about everything that happened just this week:There's no Hope: Communications director Hope Hicks, an original Trump loyalist, quits after reportedly telling the House intelligence committee that she sometimes tells white lies for President Trump. Trump berates her, asking her how could she be so ""stupid."" The next day, she announces her impending departure from the White House. Hicks was Trump's fourth communications director in just 13 months — and one of some 50 White House staffers who have quit, been fired or reassigned.Retreat on guns: Trump declares on Monday about the Florida school shooting, ""I really believe I'd run in there even if I didn't have a weapon."" He then holds a made-for-cable-TV White House meeting on guns Wednesday that shows his shallow policy understanding of the subject and the allegiances in the room. (We fact-checked it here.) He accuses senators of ""being afraid of the NRA."" He angers conservatives, and gun legislation is pushed off indefinitely. By Friday, he appears to retreat from more liberal positions on guns he had seemed to endorse in the Wednesday meeting and meets with the NRA, and they tweet praise for each other.He went to Jared: Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, sees his security clearance downgraded to a level that means he can't read the president's daily brief. It's also revealed that the president's daughter and Kushner's wife, Ivanka, is also reportedly being investigated by the FBI for one of her business deals. And it's announced the couple's spokesman will be leaving the White House.""Mr. Magoo"" fights back: Trump feuds again with his attorney general, questioning his handing off a review of use of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court by the FBI to the Justice Department's inspector general. Trump calls the move ""DISGRACEFUL!"" Behind his back, Trump reportedly calls Jeff Sessions ""Mr. Magoo."" Sessions stands up for himself and says as long as he is in the job, he'll do it with dignity. He then dines out in plain view at an upscale Washington, D.C., restaurant with Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, and Solicitor General Noel Francisco — an apparent show of unity in the topmost ranks of the Department of Justice.Man of God: White House chief of staff John Kelly, who stripped Kushner of his top-secret security clearance, jokes that he never wanted to leave the Department of Homeland Security and that he misses the staffers there more than ever, rolls his eyes and says, ""God punished me."" Kelly has had a rough go of it lately as chief of staff running a West Wing rocked by a domestic abuse scandal involving former staff secretary Rob Porter and questions about background checks and interim security clearances for Porter, Kushner and other staffers. But he told reporters Friday that he did not offer to resign over the Porter episode. ""I have absolutely nothing to even consider resigning over,"" the retired Marine Corps general said after walking some journalists through the timeline of how the White House handled revelations about Porter.Never get involved in a trade war in Asia! Trump hastily announces 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports to Make American Steel Great Again, but he winds up angering conservative business interests, including manufacturers and the oil industry. He also overrules economic adviser Gary Cohn, fueling speculation that he, too, is not long for this White House. Amid the backlash, Trump reacts by tweeting, ""trade wars are good, and easy to win."" The Dow drops 420 points on the news.Huh-D? Ben Carson, Trump's housing and urban development secretary, faces backlash for approval of lavish spending, which includes more than $31,000 for a new office suite dining room set. A former HUD official claims she was told by superiors, NPR's Brakkton Booker reports, to ""find money"" above the $5,000 spending limit to outfit the office.""Alex"" Baldwin at 5:42 a.m.: Inexplicably, Trump begins Friday by taking aim at Alec Baldwin, mistakenly calling the actor ""Alex"" Baldwin on Twitter (before deleting it). (The real Alex Baldwin didn't appreciate it.) Trump reposts online correcting the spelling and slamming Baldwin for his impersonation of Trump on Saturday Night Live (and saying Darrell Hammond is better). Baldwin responds, tweeting he would ""like to hang in for the impeachment hearings"" and alluding to the latest rumors of Trump's paramours.""Every day feels like a week, every week like a month ...""Watching it all has left veteran Republican strategists scratching their heads — and yet feeling unsurprised.""There were probably a dozen things that happened this past week that in isolation would have generated huge headlines and headaches for past White Houses,"" said Brian Jones, a GOP political consultant, who has worked on five presidential campaigns, including George W. Bush's, John McCain's and Mitt Romney's. ""Collectively, the pace of the bad news really seemed to quicken this week for Trump, which is notable given that this White House has established a new gold standard for wild news cycles.""Kevin Madden, another Republican campaign and Capitol Hill veteran, said he is not so sure that this week is worse than others — or if it just feels that way.""With this administration, every day feels like a week, every week like a month and every month like a year,"" he said. ""It's not that this one was different, because there have been weeks just as bad, but we've almost become inured to the past effect since there have been so many of them. The thing that's more and more apparent is that the trend line never seems to get better or the chaos less frequent. There's no sense that a stabilization is occurring or even on the horizon.""That is a point Jones drives home, noting that the ""containment team"" is dwindling in numbers and influence — and who knows what that could mean for the future of the Trump presidency.""Since Trump's election, there's been this underlying chaos in the White House, but on some level, it's been mitigated by people like Hope Hicks, Gary Cohn, immediate family members and a few others,"" Jones said. ""With that containment team either leaving the White House or being under fire, it seems like we're now in a new world of free-form chaos."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/03/590474158/the-last-bush-tries-to-survive-in-the-party-of-trump","In a dynasty that dates back over 60 years in American politics, there is just one member of the Bush family left in any state or federal elected office.Texas land commissioner George P. Bush is the one carrying the torch and facing a stiff primary on March 6, barely two years after his father Jeb's presidential bid failed as Donald Trump took over the Republican Party. To survive, the younger Bush has decided to adapt to — rather than resist — the new direction of the GOP.The Bush family political dynasty goes back to 1952. That's when Prescott Bush became a U.S. senator from Connecticut. Then his son George H. W. Bush became president. Jeb Bush would become governor of Florida. After six years as Texas governor, George W. Bush won the presidency, as well. Since he left office nearly a decade ago, there's been a lag.In 2014, George P. Bush announced he was running for Texas land commissioner.Almost as soon as Bush entered that race, he was projected to win. The entire campaign turned into more of a victory tour then political race.""He was a young, vibrant, good looking guy. So he looked like a central casting, next generation Bush candidate, starting in Texas but with national possabilities,"" Southern Methodist University political science professor Cal Jillson said.He breezed through the 2014 GOP primary, easily won the general election in a deep red state, and already had some Republican activists talking about future races for governor — or even president someday.Then the realities of holding office began to sink in. There are questions about how well his office has handled Hurricane Harvey relief. He's also received bad press over his handling of the Alamo. You know, the one we're supposed to remember all the time. Those issues brought criticism from some in the party, and motivated Bush's predecessor, former land commissioner Jerry Patterson, to challenge him in the GOP primary. Patterson had left the office in 2014 in a failed attempt to run for lieutenant governor.So facing a tough primary, George P. Bush has sought out the most coveted endorsement in Republican politics: President Trump.This might be considered a hard endorsement for Bush to get. Trump was the man who labeled his father ""low energy Jeb"" and blamed his uncle for 9/11 during the 2016 GOP presidential primaries. Trump even made a disparaging statement about the fact that George P.'s mother was born in Mexico. His father, uncle and grandparents all said they didn't vote for Trump in the 2016 general election.But George P. Bush endorsed Trump anyway.""From Team Bush, it's a bitter pill to swallow,"" Bush told supporters during a speech in 2016. ""But you know what? You get back up and you help the man that won, and you make sure that we stop Hillary Clinton.""And now that Bush needs help, President Trump is there to provide it. In a tweet from Feb. 27 Trump said, ""Texas [land commissioner] George P. Bush backed me when it wasn't the politically correct thing to do, and I back him now.""While this may appear to be a friendly relationship, the truth is President Trump has rejected much of what the Bush family stood for in politics — whether it's on immigration or foreign policy. Yet, George P. Bush is still trying to bridge that divide.SMU's Jillson wonders whether George P. Bush can fully evolve in what's now Trump's party. ""And now I think people have real questions about what the upside of George P. Bush as a politician and an office holder actually is,"" he said.If Bush loses his GOP primary race on March 6, that could have pundits across the country talking about the end of the Bush political dynasty.Still, it's a big family. Just because George P. was expected to lead the next generation doesn't mean one of his cousins won't.Remember, the family always believed Jeb would be the second president from the Bush dynasty, while George W. lost an early congressional campaign and seemed to enjoy running a baseball team into his forties."

He was praising the fact that the Republican tax legislation, signed into law in December, canceled out the provision of the ACA, or Obamacare, that penalized people who don't purchase health insurance.""[Obamacare] was the stupidest, dumb-ass bill that I've ever seen,"" Hatch said. ""Now some of you may have loved it; if you do, you are one of the stupidest dumb-ass people I've ever met.""In a statement on Friday, Hatch called the comments, which he appeared to be reading as part of prepared remarks, ""a poorly worded joke"" that was ""not reflective of my actual feelings towards my friends on the other side.""""While I occasionally slip up, I believe that my legislative record reflects my commitment to bipartisanship and civility much more than my flippant, off-the-cuff comment,"" his statement said.The majority of American adults, 54 percent, have a favorable view of the ACA, according to the most recent polling from the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll. That represents a shift, however. From the moment it was enacted in 2010, the law had been mostly unpopular. It only began to gain consistent popularity in December 2016, as the possibility it would be repealed intensified when Republicans took control of the White House and both houses of Congress.""I've been all over the world, a number of times, by the way, and frankly there's no other country that even comes close to ours,"" Hatch said Thursday. ""Well, there might be one or two that do pretty well, but they're really not in a league with us. As dumb as we are, and as stupid as some of our policies have been over the years, I can tell you that no other country can compete with the United States if we allow our true entrepreneurial spirit to go forward."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/03/590273206/the-russia-investigations-is-fisa-abuse-out-of-steam-intel-committees-on-edge","This week in the Russia investigations: The ""FISA abuse"" counter-narrative might be running out of steam — and so, apparently, is President Trump's relationship with Attorney General Jeff Sessions; the House and Senate intelligence committees are at daggers drawn; does anybody here know anything about cyber-stuff?The Russia imbroglio is so complex it's sometimes impenetrable. Maneuvering within it politically is much more difficult than any other big story these days.Example A: Republicans want to defend President Trump. One way they've done so is by making a highly wonky case against the FBI and Justice Department, arguing they abused the procedures involved with seeking surveillance warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.The bottom-line argument is easy to grasp — ""biased"" feds are out to get Trump — but keeping it going requires a huge amount of legal and technical explanation. The man who's supposed to be benefiting from all this work has signaled that he might be out of patience.When Attorney General Jeff Sessions tried on Wednesday to put more points on the board for the White House, President Trump smacked him down. Sessions had said he would recommend that the Justice Department's inspector general look into the FISA matter, injecting another day's worth of oxygen into the story. But Trump was all, like, c'mon maaaaan!The IG can't prosecute anybody!, Trump said. Plus he was appointed by President Obama, Trump said — although the IG had also served under George W. Bush — and all this kabuki isn't moving quickly enough or hitting hard enough!In short, the president made clear the ""FISA abuse"" narrative, which has its origins with Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee and House intelligence committee, is weak sauce.Sessions was stung. After all the humiliation he's endured and all the water he has carried, he seemed to say: Enough.The attorney general issued a rare riposte to a routine tongue-lashing from the president. He further tweaked the White House by signalling clearly that he is on Team Justice Department. Sessions made sure to be photographed dining out with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Solicitor General Noel Francisco. Sessions made clear in his statement that so long as he remains attorney general, the Justice Department will work by the book.In other words, Sessions will not launch a baseless criminal investigation into FISA abuse or take other actions that are not warranted, which Trump appeared to want.What does it all mean? Part 1: Sessions wants to stay in his job but keep his crayons inside the lines. He appears to remain confident that he can. Although Trump isn't happy with Sessions, the former senator enjoys a well of support from his former colleagues. That means if the president fired him, Trump might not easily get someone confirmed to take over the Justice Department who was not recused from its Russia investigation, as Sessions is.What does it all mean? Part 2: Sessions never appointed a second special counsel to investigate the first one, Robert Mueller, as Trump supporters and Trump's legal team wanted. Now, Sessions apparently does not believe there is enough evidence of FISA abuse to do more than request an IG investigation — which the IG's office can opt not to pursue. And even if the IG does open a case, it could take months or more to pay off, as Trump complained. Although the Justice Department likely will continue trying to help the White House to a certain degree, it will not act as his law firm on retainer.What does it all mean? Part 3: So, what evidence did which federal officials include in their briefing to which judge with respect to which warrant to request which authority to conduct surveillance on which person and why? The longer the story runs, the more difficult it becomes to tell. House intelligence committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has already suggested he might move on to the State Department, or to other targets in more memos.Trump's irritation suggests he may think it's time to turn the page.From a distance, Congress looks monolithic, but it contains worlds within worlds. People in the House don't necessarily like people in the Senate and vice versa, for example. The House goes fast and the Senate goes slow. The committees that authorize spending don't like the committees that appropriate money. And so forth.Against that backdrop, it isn't surprising when, for example, leaders or committees in the different chambers feud over drafting a bill or solving a problem in different ways.The House and Senate intelligence committees, however, were supposed to be different. Created after Watergate to take stronger control over the often infamous spy agencies, they were supposed to be bipartisan and collegial even when the rest of Congress wasn't.Then came the Russia imbroglio.The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has, in the view of critics, become just as much of a circus as the rest of the House. And while the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has retained much of its longtime fustiness and secrecy, cracks are beginning to appear — and it has not proven immune from spillover craziness either.When Senate intelligence committee vice chairman Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., unsuccessfully tried to get in touch with former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, author of the infamous dossier, Warner shared his efforts with the rest of the panel.But then someone on the Senate committee told the House committee about that outreach, which then told Fox News, which then ran a story that sought to tie in Warner with ""a Russian oligarch lobbyist.""The New York Times then told the story of that story.Warner and the intelligence committee's chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., went so far as to complain about Nunes to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.Longtime aficionados will recall they are not the first to make such complaints — Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray also made a visit to the speaker's office to complain about Nunes ahead of February's memo mania.All of this — leaks about leaks, intra-congressional strife, mega-skulduggery — is business as usual for much of Washington, D.C. That it has engulfed the intelligence committees, however, suggests that the last refuge is gone.In an ideal world, reporters and the public shouldn't have to be amateur intelligence analysts, piecing together elements to form a ""mosaic"" about the workings of their own government.That is how we are living our lives now, however, and some of the biggest areas missing from the picture are about the 2016 cyberattacks.The Department of Homeland Security says a number of state election systems were targeted. In at least one — Illinois — Russian hackers got in, but no one believes they did any harm. No vote tallies were affected, officials say.Yet estimates about the number of states affected have fluctuated from both official sources and via background quotes in press reports. NBC News said on Wednesday that seven states were ""compromised"" by Russian attacks. DHS fired back saying the story was wrong. NBC fired back saying DHS was wrong.Who's right? There's no way to know, as NPR's Miles Parks wrote this week — there is still no official box score for this game or final report that gives a definitive narrative.There also doesn't seem to be any good answer for when someone, whether it's Mueller, another federal agency or one of the congressional committee, will publish one."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/01/590076949/depth-of-russian-politicians-cultivation-of-nra-ties-revealed","Updated at 10:25 p.m. ETA prominent Kremlin-linked Russian politician has methodically cultivated ties with leaders of the National Rifle Association and documented efforts in real time over six years to leverage those connections and gain deeper access into American politics, NPR has learned.Russian politician Alexander Torshin said his ties to the NRA provided him access to Donald Trump — and the opportunity to serve as a foreign election observer in the United States during the 2012 election.Torshin is a prolific Twitter user, logging nearly 150,000 tweets, mostly in Russian, since his account was created in 2011. Previously obscured by language and sheer volume of tweets, Torshin has written numerous times about his connections with the NRA, of which he is a known paid lifetime member. NPR has translated a selection of those posts that document Torshin's relationship to the group.These revelations come amid news that the FBI is investigating whether Torshin, the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia, illegally funneled money to the NRA to assist the Trump campaign in 2016, McClatchy reported in January.In a letter to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate intelligence committee, the NRA denied any wrongdoing and suggested the FBI is investigating Torshin, not the NRA. Neither the NRA nor Torshin responded to inquiries from NPR.Investigations by Congress and the Department of Justice have revealed that the Russian government has sought to sharpen political divisions among American citizens by amplifying controversial social issues. Investigators have expressed concern about Russian links to the NRA, one of the most politically polarizing organizations in the U.S.Torshin is a former Russian senator and served as the deputy speaker of Russia's parliament for more than a decade. Known as a Putin ally, he also spent time on Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee, a state body that includes the director of Russia's internal security service and the ministers of defense, interior and foreign affairs.Translation of November 2016 tweet: ""For 15 years, I've traveled to the U.S. with official delegations, and more often — privately. In this time, I NEVER HEARD ONE BAD WORD ABOUT RUSSIA!""Torshin's use of NRA connections to open doors, and his 2015 claim to know Trump through the organization, raise new questions about the group's connections with Russian officials — at a time when the organization is being roundly criticized by its opponents, and at times the president himself, for opposition to gun control.The president has also defended the group in recent days as the gun debate has re-emerged following a Florida school shooting, including a tweet calling the group's leaders ""Great American Patriots.""The NRA has been a key part of Trump's conservative base. After a meeting with lawmakers in which Trump angered many conservatives for entertaining proposals for gun control, the president tweeted that he had another meeting with NRA leaders in the Oval Office on Thursday night.On his verified Twitter account, Torshin talked about how he knew Trump through the NRA, citing a connection at the group's 2015 convention. Responding to a tweet about comedian Larry David accusing Trump of being a racist, Torshin said he knew the businessman through the NRA, and he defended him.Translation of November 2015 tweet: ""A comedian should make people laugh! Right? So he is trying! I know D. Trump (through NRA). A decent person.""""I saw him in Nashville"" in April 2015, Torshin added later, the date and site of the NRA's 2015 convention. Trump gave a speech at that convention, the outlines of which would become familiar as his stump speech throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. The White House did not respond to repeated requests for comment by NPR but in 2017 denied to Bloomberg News that Trump has ever met Torshin.Among his tens of thousands of tweets, Torshin also documented his attendance at every NRA convention between 2012 and 2016, only some of which have been previously reported.Torshin's attendance at the NRA convention in 2016 is where he reportedly met with Donald Trump Jr.Torshin had made repeated attempts to meet with Donald Trump himself at that convention during the presidential election year, but there is no evidence of this occurring. A conservative activist with ties to Torshin aide Maria Butina reached out to the Trump campaign in 2016, saying that Russia was ""quietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the U.S."" and would try to use the NRA convention to make ""first contact,"" the New York Times reported.""Putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,"" the activist, Paul Erickson, wrote. ""He wants to extend an invitation to Mr. Trump to visit him in the Kremlin before the election."" Erickson has business ties to Butina, having started an LLC with her in South Dakota.Torshin has used his repeated trips to NRA conventions to cultivate relationships with top NRA officials. And his Twitter account documents that he has personally met with every person who has been president of the NRA since 2012.On Twitter, Torshin portrayed these meetings as more than merely casual encounters. In 2017, he tweeted that he was bringing a gift to then-NRA President Allan Cors and suggested he was familiar with Cors' hobbies.Translation of January 2017 tweet: ""Bought a gift for NRA President Allan Cors. Tanks are his favorite topic!""Cors is the founder of the Virginia Museum of Military Vehicles, according to its website.In a public Dropbox album that Torshin linked to from his Twitter account, he is seen meeting with former NRA President Jim Porter as well as another former NRA president, David Keene.His tweets suggest a longtime relationship with Keene, who repeatedly appears in photos as Torshin documents his visits, suggesting that their meeting was not merely coincidental. Keene did not respond to a request for comment.Torshin has also met the current president of the NRA, Pete Brownell, who was part of an NRA delegation that visited Moscow in 2015.These relationships that he cultivated appeared to open another door. Torshin came to the United States in 2012 as an international election observer and watched as ballots were cast during the Obama-Romney presidential contest in Tennessee. This was possible, he wrote, because of his NRA links.Translation of January 2015 tweet: ""I was there at Obama's last election! The NRA card, to me as an observer from Russia, opened access to any [polling] station.""""Tennessee resident Kline Preston requested Mr. Torshin to be an international observer in November 2012,"" Adam Ghassemi, a spokesman for the Tennessee secretary of state, told NPR. The Washington Post reported last year that Preston, a Tennessee lawyer, was the one who originally introduced Torshin to Keene back in 2011.The heat is on the Russian politician, who was alleged by Spanish police to have directed financial transactions for the Russian mob. Not only is the FBI reportedly investigating him — the bureau declined to comment for this story — but lawmakers involved in congressional investigations have also expressed interest in Torshin.Both the Senate and House intelligence committees are currently engaged in investigations into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee and a member of the Senate intelligence committee, has demanded that the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network hand over documents related to Torshin and the NRA.""The NRA and its related entities do not accept funds from foreign persons or entities in connection with United States elections,"" NRA General Counsel John Frazer wrote in response to a request from Wyden to turn over documents related to transactions between the NRA and Russian citizens. ""NRA political decisions are made by NRA officers and executive staff, all of whom are United States citizens. No foreign nationals are consulted in any way on these decisions.""Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told NPR this week that the committee's members have asked relevant witnesses about the NRA through the course of their investigation.""I can't go into what we've been able to learn thus far on that issue. I can tell you it's one of deep concern to me and to other members of the committee, that we get to the bottom of these allegations that the Russians may have sought to funnel money through the NRA,"" Schiff said. ""It would be negligent of us not to investigate.""Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of research firm Fusion GPS, alluded to Torshin and the NRA during his closed-door testimony before the House intelligence committee in November.""It appears the Russians, you know, infiltrated the NRA. And there is more than one explanation for why,"" Simpson told lawmakers. ""But I would say broadly speaking, it appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations. And they targeted various conservative organizations, religious and otherwise, and they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the NRA.""Not only are congressional investigators interested in the NRA's relationship with Russia, but this inquiry comes as the NRA is receiving additional pressure from groups hoping to pass more gun restrictions into law and as dozens of American companies have cut ties with the organization in response to the Parkland, Fla., shooting last month.""These revelations suggest that for years the NRA courted a top Putin ally who is now reportedly attracting scrutiny from the FBI,"" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told NPR. ""NRA leaders still haven't explained their close relationship with Russian officials in Putin's orbit. Until they do, people will continue to wonder what the NRA is hiding.""NPR's Alina Selyukh and Audrey McNamara contributed to this story."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/02/590308832/who-wants-to-arm-teachers-republican-men","Guns have dominated politics this week. And the one idea President Trump keeps coming back to is arming teachers.But a new NPR/Ipsos poll found that really only one group of people are in favor of training teachers to carry guns in schools — Republicans, especially Republican men.Overall, 59 percent of Americans are opposed to arming teachers, according to the poll.But about two-thirds (68 percent) of Republicans are in favor of it.Republican men, in particular, poll the highest of every subgroup — 71 percent of them would like to see teachers armed.Republican women also like the idea — 64 percent are in favor.On the opposite end of that spectrum, the least likely to support arming teachers are Democratic women — 86 percent of them are against it. Overall, 82 percent of Democrats don't think it's a good idea, and 60 percent of independents are also against it.What's more, Americans say arming teachers is the least likely way to prevent school shootings — behind stricter gun laws, metal detectors, hiring more school counselors or having armed guards.So there is a huge partisan divide on this issue, and once again, on yet another policy issue, it's the president talking to his base and not much beyond that.At a meeting with lawmakers on Wednesday, Trump indicated an openness to ideas favored by Democrats, too, though. He has expressed support for raising the gun-purchasing age to 21 and seemed open to measures favored by liberal Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who are pushing for reinstating the 1990s-era assault weapons ban and tackling domestic violence, respectively.But he met with the NRA Thursday night at the White House, saying it was a ""Good (Great) meeting.""Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, retweeted Trump and said Trump and Vice President Pence ""don't want gun control.""If Trump is indeed backing away from more gun control measures, it's similar to what he did on immigration and DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He had called for a bipartisan solution for immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but came to the country as children. Ultimately, though, he told lawmakers any such legislation would also need to include funding for his border wall and curbs on legal immigration. None of the proposed bills mustered enough votes to pass the Senate.So, on yet another culturally sensitive issue for his base, Trump appears to be backing away from a more bipartisan approach. (Trump has largely maintained his 37 to 42 percent average approval rating through most of his presidency, because his Republican base has stayed with him.)That might not be surprising, considering it may be what is keeping his approval rating from dipping any lower than it already has.The poll was conducted from Feb. 27-28 with a survey sample of 1,005 adults across the country, chosen randomly from Ipsos's online panel. They were interviewed in English, and the sample includes 351 Democrats, 341 Republicans and 203 independents. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/02/589849342/npr-poll-after-parkland-number-of-americans-who-want-gun-restrictions-grows","An increasing number of Americans, both Republicans and Democrats, want more gun regulation, according to a new NPR/Ipsos poll that surveyed people in the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting.Three-quarters of people polled said gun laws should be stricter than they are today. That's an increase — in a short period of time — from October 2017, when NPR conducted a similar survey in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting. Then, 68 percent said gun laws should be stricter than they were.The poll also found widespread bipartisan support for a range of gun-control policies, including:The only policy intended to curb gun violence that is opposed by a majority of Americans (59 percent) is the one most frequently touted by President Trump — the idea of training teachers to carry guns in schools.The poll also found that while nearly every gun policy was supported by a majority of both Republicans and Democrats, the one exception was arming teachers.There was a clear-cut partisan gulf — 68 percent of Republicans favored the idea of training teachers to carry guns compared to just 18 percent of Democrats. Arming teachers was by far the most polarizing policy suggestion; the poll found a 50-point divide between Republicans and Democrats.Trump's in sync with his baseThe president's outspoken criticism of schools as gun-free zones and his recent rhetoric calling for a comprehensive gun bill suggests he's acutely aware of how his base voters feel about gun policies — and the growing desire, even among Republicans, for some sort of stricter gun-control legislation.""We see in this study, a majority of Republicans saying that they are supportive of a variety of different gun-control measures, many of which Trump mentioned explicitly in his [White House] briefing,"" said Chris Jackson, director of the public polling team at Ipsos. ""And that's in contrast to a lot of Republican elected officials, who have taken a much more Second Amendment absolutist stance.""Although Trump remains friendly with the National Rifle Association and its leadership, he's recently shown a willingness to challenge GOP orthodoxy on guns.In a televised White House meeting with legislators Wednesday, Trump surprised (and angered) many of his fellow conservative lawmakers with his ad-hoc approach to gun-control policy. He questioned his fellow Republicans' relationship with the NRA and dismissed a concealed carry provision that conservatives wanted as a trade-off for some restrictions.""They have great power over you people. They have less power over me,"" Trump told GOP lawmakers at that meeting, adding, ""Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified.""Trump suggested he was open to expanding background checks and possibly raising the age to purchase an AR-15. (Both popular measures, according to the NPR/Ipsos poll).""President Trump is actually closer to where the Republican base is on the issue of guns than a lot of Republican elected officials,"" Jackson said. ""And I think this is something that Trump has done a lot through his political career; he often times finds himself closer to the Republican base than the establishment does.""Of course, the president has a history of adopting popular opinions and speaking to the polls, and then subsequently reversing his position and reverting to a more traditionally conservative attitude, as he did with his initial support for a bill that would protect DACA recipients from deportation.Americans want Congress to actAny hope for a quick legislative answer to the gun debate fell apart in the Senate Thursday. And although the Senate now has no plans to vote on gun legislation in the near future, the NPR/Ipsos poll finds that a majority of Americans (78 percent) say Congress needs to do more to address gun violence.But the intensity for congressional action lies with the Democrats — 93 percent of whom want more action, compared to 68 percent among Republicans.Jackson said the biggest change he's noticed since the October survey is the overall importance people are giving to the gun debate. Crime/gun violence is now the No. 1 issue worrying Americans. (Last October, it was terrorism).The shift since last fall is largely because more Democrats and independents say they're concerned about guns, but Republicans shifted some as well.And the poll found Americans are currently saying guns will be an important factor in their vote this November. Roughly two-thirds, or 63 percent, said so.Traditionally, gun control is one of those issues that's dominated by a small slice of the electorate — an energized group of committed gun-rights activists.But the political winds may be shifting.""This data indicates there's actually an increasing energy on the side of gun control,"" Jackson said. And ""given that guns have become very partisan, that may have really significant results in the midterms.""And there are signs the NRA's influence among voters may be declining. The NPR survey shows a decreasing number of Americans overall (led by a shift in Democrats' attitudes) said the NRA represents their views — just 36 percent overall down from 43 percent in October.Guns are still partisanThere are still some major disagreements along party lines that reflect the overall gun debate in the country.On the question of whether the country would be safer if more people carried guns, there was a huge divide, for example — 55 percent of Republicans felt the country would be safer, compared to just 15 percent of Democrats.And likewise, when people were asked whether they believed the premise that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun — there was a split along partisan lines — 71 percent of Republicans agreed, compared to 24 percent of Democrats.The split over Trump's handling of the Parkland shooting situation seems to mirror his overall approval rating and shows how much partisanship affects people's perspectives — 71 percent of Republicans approved of how the president handled the aftermath of the school shooting, compared to just 9 percent of Democrats.The poll was conducted from Feb. 27-28 with a survey sample of 1,005 adults across the country, chosen randomly from Ipsos's online panel. They were interviewed in English, and the sample includes 351 Democrats, 341 Republicans and 203 independents. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/02/589845319/national-weather-service-forecast-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-budget-cuts","Last year, according to government figures, there were 16 ""climate disaster events"" with losses exceeding $1 billion each in the U.S.So the weather is something to keep an eye on, and since 1870 what's now known as the National Weather Service has been doing that. But for the last several years, it's been doing so with serious staff shortages.Now, it faces the prospect of permanent job losses.The Trump administration wants to eliminate 355 jobs, and $75 million from the weather service budget.""The straw is close to breaking the camel's back right now,"" says Daniel Sobien, president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization. ""That will break the camel's back.""Sobien says there are vacant positions across the board. ""Tsunami warning centers are understaffed; the weather forecast centers are understaffed,"" he says, and places like the hurricane center and storm predictions center ""are having big vacancy problems, too.""The employees organization represents some 2,500 weather service workers. And Sobien says right now, 10 percent of the jobs at the service are vacant.The weather service has offices covering ""a quarter of the globe,"" Sobien says, from Guam and American Samoa to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Caribou, Maine.Mark Pellerito, a meteorologist and union shop steward at the Binghamton, N.Y., office, says they're down five positions out of 18 total jobs. Weather doesn't take a day off, he notes. The office needs to be staffed 24/7, meaning long hours, a lot of overtime and a family-work balance that is out of whack. ""As much as we love our job, which we really do,"" Pellerito says, ""this is something we've been passionate about since kindergarten."" But, he says, ""we love our families, too, and not seeing them makes it pretty difficult.""Overworked meteorologists can also put the public at risk. Tired people make mistakes, and Pellerito says the National Weather Service is no different. ""Perhaps we're stretched thin and we miss a warning. If you're the one who didn't quite get to your basement in time because of that one- to two-minute delay, it dramatically impacts your life.""Gary Szatkowski, now retired, was the meteorologist in charge at the Mount Holly, N.J., office, which provided forecasts for the Philadelphia area, and compares the staffing shortage to driving down the highway with bald tires. ""I couldn't tell you whether you're going to get a flat tire in the next mile or you might drive another 500 or a thousand miles on bald tires and not have a problem,"" he says. ""But it's a risky behavior and that's unfortunately the place the operations staff for the National Weather Service has been put in for a number of years.""The Commerce Department, which oversees the National Weather Service, declined to provide a spokesperson for an interview. But in an email, an official said the service plans to hire 80 additional meteorologists by April 1 to address the current staff shortage, and it is working to speed the hiring process, including expedited background checks.The official said under the proposed budget, the National Weather Service would ""begin implementing a series of operational reforms aimed at increasing staffing flexibility,"" which could mean ""reducing operational hours at various offices while maintaining meteorological services through collaboration with other NWS offices,"" and ""making better use of collaborative forecast processes, technological innovation, and a more efficient forecaster career path.""The official says that while the fiscal year 2019 budget would reduce positions by 355, this equates to 217 full-time employees.Still, Sobien says some offices, including those in San Francisco and Tampa, will have to close on nights and weekends with the result there will be ""really no coverage there."" He added, ""another office will look at the weather for them. It's a dangerous idea. They're risking peoples lives.""It's not clear what Congress will do with the proposed Trump budget. But weather service employees worry more cuts on top of current staff shortages will create the perfect storm at an agency that has been trusted and relied on."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/03/02/589921130/science-provides-few-facts-on-effects-of-gun-policies-report-finds","An analysis published Friday confirms the state of American gun policy science is not good, overall.The nonprofit RAND Corporation analyzed thousands of studies and found only 63 that establish a causal relationship between specific gun policies and outcomes such as reductions in homicide and suicide, leaving lawmakers without clear facts about one of the most divisive issues in American politics.The analysis is notable for its depth, if not for its overall finding — RAND spent two years and $1 million dollars on the project, which, beyond the analysis, also included a survey of gun policy experts and the construction of a research database on state gun laws. For decades, social scientists and other researchers have pointed to a profound, and purposeful, lack of federal funding for gun research and a lack of federal data-gathering on guns as enormous impediments to studying gun violence. The federal government has spent much less on research into gun violence than on similarly lethal issues, such as motor vehicle crashes, liver disease and sepsis.""Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on, we didn't find any evidence,"" says Andrew Morral, a behavioral scientist at RAND and the leader of the project.They found, for example, no clear evidence regarding the effects of any gun policies on hunting and recreational gun use, or on officer-involved shootings, or on mass shootings or on the defensive use of guns by civilians.There were some categories with better data, however, Morral says. There is relatively strong evidence, for example, that policies meant to prevent children from getting access to firearms — such as laws that require guns to be stored unloaded, or in locked containers — reduce both suicide and unintentional injury and death.Previous work has also found that places that require a permit (issued by law enforcement) for the purchase a firearm do reduce violent crime.There is also some evidence that prohibitions against purchase by people who have been diagnosed with mental illness reduce violent crime, and that ""stand your ground"" laws, which allow citizens who feel threatened in public to use lethal force without retreating first, lead to an increase in violent crime.In general, however, good studies were few and far between, the RAND researchers say.To help bridge the data gap for scientists, RAND has now compiled an open-source database of state-by-state gun laws going back to 1979. A similar, unrelated database run out of Boston University was published last year.""Given the lack of data in the firearm research field, [the RAND database] will be a welcome addition, and I'm sure it will be valuable to researchers,"" says Dr. Michael Siegel, the physician who leads the Boston University project. He notes that, since it launched, the Boston database has been most helpful for journalists writing about gun violence.""It's funny because I didn't actually think about that as a purpose of the project when we started it,"" says Siegel, ""but it seems to have become the primary use of the database so far (in addition to use by other researchers).""The RAND team also surveyed 95 gun policy experts from across the political spectrum about what they thought the effects of 15 different gun policies would be on 12 outcomes. The policies included universal background checks, bans on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, expanded mental illness prohibitions, minimum age requirements and required reporting of lost or stolen weapons.Many of the policies are now being considered by state and federal lawmakers, after a man used an AR-15-style rifle to kill 17 people at a Florida high school in February.The vast majority of the specialists RAND surveyed agreed that the primary objectives of gun policies should be reducing suicides and homicides, and that protecting privacy, enabling hunting and sport shooting and preventing mass shootings were secondary priorities.""That was a surprise, actually,"" says Morral. ""I think people on either side of gun policy debates think that the other side has misplaced values — or that it's a values problem, in any case. But that's not what we find. We find people prioritize the same things in the same order.""However, those surveyed varied widely in their predictions about how different policies would affect each outcome.""Where they disagree is on which laws will achieve those those objectives. So this is a disagreement about facts,"" says Morral. ""And the facts are sparse."""

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/01/589880256/planned-parenthood-plans-major-political-effort-in-key-states-for-2018-midterms","Add Planned Parenthood to the list of organizations looking to take advantage of President Trump's low approval ratings in the 2018 midterm elections.The organization is not new to the rough-and-tumble of electoral politics — and has often itself become a top issue for Republicans looking to slash federal funding for the organization — but this year Planned Parenthood Votes and Planned Parenthood Action Fund will launch their biggest-ever push to try to tip the balance in Congress and in key states.Planned Parenthood sees the Trump administration as a threat and, with a Republican-controlled Congress, sees the danger to abortion rights as great as it has been in decades. But the upside for progressive groups is that Trump has also inspired a newly energized movement in protest of his policies. The best example of this so far is the massive Women's March on Washington, D.C., a year ago, a day after Trump's inauguration, and the hundreds of smaller marches across the country on that day and since.Deirdre Schifeling, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, which along with Planned Parenthood Action Fund constitutes Planned Parenthood's political operation, says the group has committed an initial investment of $20 million to be used mostly on Senate and gubernatorial contests in eight states.""We will be supporting candidates who support reproductive rights,"" Schifeling says, adding that such rights are ""really at stake in the country, especially this year."" She says ""we support candidates who support access to Planned Parenthood and who support women and all people making their own health care decisions without interference from politicians.""Federal funding for Planned Parenthood — which is not an actual line item in the budget, but rather reimbursement for health care services provided to patients — has become a perpetual political battle in Washington. Republicans in Congress have long made ending any federal dollars for the organization a campaign issue. But so far, the funding survives.Planned Parenthood's target list of states includes Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which were instrumental in Trump's 2016 victory. The others where Planned Parenthood will pour in money and resources are Arizona, Florida, Minnesota and Nevada — each of which has hotly contested races.Notably, states so far not on the Planned Parenthood target list are two of the more conservative states, each of which has an incumbent Democratic senator on the ballot this year: Missouri and North Dakota. Both are states Trump won easily and where protecting abortion rights is a more difficult case to make with a more conservative populace.This year's Planned Parenthood spending will mostly fund a network of grass-roots volunteers to reach out to voters where health care and the right to an abortion are considered important. That likely means a focus on suburbs and female voters. Schifeling says there will be a ""robust door-to-door canvassing operation,"" but she adds that ""we will also be investing in paid digital and some paid TV [advertising] in key races.""Voter turnout will be the key. The money being committed this year is already $5 million greater than the $15 million Planned Parenthood spent on the 2014 midterm elections.Meanwhile, groups that oppose abortion rights are also expected to be active in many of the same states. The Susan B. Anthony List is one such organization. It has not released a dollar amount for its 2018 political operations, but it too will fund an aggressive door-to-door campaign in key states including Ohio, Florida and Missouri. Part of the argument these groups will use is that Trump has been their friend, that he named a solid conservative, Justice Neil Gorsuch, to the Supreme Court and that such gains need to be protected.For Planned Parenthood, a lesson of 2017 — when voter discontent over the Trump presidency helped fuel a swing of 16 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates from Republicans to Democrats and a near Democratic takeover — is that there are opportunities."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/01/589397317/repeal-the-second-amendment-thats-not-so-simple-here-s-what-it-would-take","""The Second Amendment.""If you've lived in America, you've heard those words spoken with feeling.The feeling may have been forceful, even vehement.""Why? The Second Amendment, that's why.""The same words can be heard uttered in bitterness, as if in blame.""Why? The Second Amendment, that's why.""Or then again, with reverence, an invocation of the sacred — rather like ""the Second Coming.""Talk of gun rights and gun control is back on full boil after 17 people were killed in the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, so the conversation turns to the Second Amendment quickly and often.We are talking, of course, about the Second Amendment to U.S. Constitution, in the Bill of Rights.It reads in full:Simple. And not simple. Assuming it means just what it says, just what does it actually say?Scholars have parsed the words, and courts and lawyers have argued over their meaning. Historians have debated what was meant by ""well-regulated militia"" back in 1789.Some say the framers only meant to protect well-organized militias in the respective states, forerunners of today's National Guard. Others say the framers also intended to shield the guns of individuals, the weapons they would use if those militias were called upon to fight.Heller brings some clarityTo some extent, the issue was clarified, if not settled, by the Heller decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008. The 5-4 decision held that the Second Amendment meant individuals had an inherent right to own guns for lawful purposes.Heller applied that standard to overturn a ban on privately held handguns, enacted in the District of Columbia. But the same basic reasoning has also been used to defend the private ownership of AR-15-type rifles such as the one used in Parkland and other mass shootings in recent years.Congress tried to ban ""assault-style"" weapons in 1994 but put a 10-year sunset provision in the law. It survived court challenges at the time, but when the 10-year term had passed, the majority control of Congress had also passed — from the Democrats, who had enacted the ban, to the Republicans, who let it lapse.Since then, all efforts to restrict the sale of such weapons have failed. Even relatively bipartisan attempts at strengthening other restrictions, such as the Manchin-Toomey background check expansion bill in 2013, have fallen short of the necessary supermajority needed for passage in the Senate.It was not, as President Trump alleged Wednesday, because of a lack of ""presidential backup."" President Barack Obama supported the bill, as Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, pointed out to Trump. Republicans filibustered the bill, which got 54 votes.In each case, defenders of gun rights have invoked the Second Amendment, the text that casts a long shadow across all discussions of guns in the U.S. At times, it seems to all but end such discussion.Parkland changes calculusBut now, the tide is running the other way. The Parkland shootings have created a new moment and a new movement, led by teenagers who survived the tragedy and took their protests to social media and beyond.Suddenly, even Trump is tossing out ideas about keeping students safe, arming teachers, restraining gun sales through background checks and higher age limits, and even banning accessories such as ""bump stocks"" that enable nonautomatic weapons to fire rapidly and repeatedly.And it's still unclear what Trump wants exactly. Republicans on Capitol Hill seem flummoxed by Trump's posture.After Trump's made-for-cable bipartisan meeting at the White House with members of Congress, Texas Republican John Cornyn, a leader on gun issues in the Senate, seemed to scratch his head.""I think everybody is trying to absorb what we just heard,"" Cornyn told reporters. ""He's a unique president, and I think if he was focused on a specific piece of legislation rather than a grab bag of ideas, then I think he could have a lot of influence, but right now we don't have that.""He added that he didn't think simply because the president says he supports something that it would pass muster with Republicans. ""I wouldn't confuse what he said with what can actually pass,"" Cornyn said. ""I don't expect to see any great divergence in terms of people's views on the Second Amendment, for example.""Ah, and there are those two words again — Second Amendment.If new restrictions are enacted — a prospect far from certain, as Cornyn rightly points out — they will surely be tested in the courts. There, it will be argued that they infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens to ""keep and bear"" firearms.In other words, they will run afoul of, that's right, the Second Amendment.Anticipating that, some gun control advocates — and at least one lifelong Republican — want to leap to the ultimate battlement and do it now. They want to repeal, or substantially alter, the formidable amendment itself.That would seem logical, at least to these advocates. If some 70 percent of Americans want more gun control and the Second Amendment stands in their way, why shouldn't they be able to do something about it?Someday, it is conceivable, the people and politicians of the United States may be ready for that. But it will need to be a very different United States than we know today.Why? Because amendments to the Constitution, once ratified, become fully part of the Constitution. Changing or removing them requires a two-stage process that has proved historically difficult.The Founding Fathers were willing to be edited, it seems, but they did not want it to be easy. So they made the amending process a steep uphill climb, requiring a clear national consensus to succeed.Why it takes consensusA proposed amendment to the Constitution must first be passed by Congress with two-thirds majorities in both the House and the Senate.The two chambers have not achieved such a margin for a newly written amendment to the Constitution in nearly half a century. The last such effort was the 26th Amendment (lowering the voting age nationwide from 21 to 18), and it cleared Capitol Hill in March 1971.(There has been another amendment added since, in 1992, but it had been written and approved by Congress literally generations ago. More about that curious ""zombie"" amendment below.)Even after surviving both chambers of Congress in 1971, the 18-year-old vote amendment still had to survive the second stage of the process — the more difficult stage.Just like all the other amendments before it, the new voting age had to be ratified by three-fourths of the states. That is currently at least 38 states. Another way to look at it: If as few as 13 states refuse, the amendment stalls.This arduous process has winnowed out all but a handful of the amendments proposed over the past 230 years. Every Congress produces scores of proposals, sometimes well over 100. The 101st Congress (1989 to 1991) produced 214.Some deal with obscure concerns; many address facets of the electoral process — especially the Electoral College and the choosing of a president. Many are retreads from earlier sessions of Congress. The one thing most have in common is that they never even come to a vote.Two that fell shortIn 1995, a watershed year with big new GOP majorities in both chambers, two major constitutional amendments were brought to votes in the Capitol. One would have imposed term limits on members of Congress. It failed to get even close to two-thirds in the House, so the Senate did not bother.The other proposed amendment would have required the federal government to balance its budget, not in theory down the road but in reality and in real time. It quickly got two-thirds in the House but failed to reach that threshold in the Senate by a single vote (one Republican in the chamber voted no).So even relatively popular ideas with a big head of steam can hit the wall of the amendment process. How much more challenging would it be to tackle individual gun ownership in a country where so many citizens own guns — and care passionately about their right to do so?Overcoming the NRA and other elements of the gun lobby is only the beginning. The real obstacle would be tremendous support for guns in Southern, Western and rural Midwestern states, which would easily total up to more than enough states to block a gun control amendment.There have been six amendments that got the needed margins in House and Senate but not the needed margin of support in the state legislatures. The most recent was the Equal Rights Amendment, a remarkably simple statement (""Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on account of sex"") that cleared Congress with bipartisan support in 1972 and quickly won nods from most of the states.But in the mid-1970s, a resistance campaign began and stymied the ERA in many of the remaining states. The resistance then managed to persuade several states to rescind their ratification votes. With momentum now reversed, the ERA died when its window for ratification closed.Zombie amendmentsOther amendments that met similar fates included one granting statehood to the District of Columbia. Like the ERA, the D.C. amendment had a time limit for ratification that expired. But other amendments sent out for ratification in the past did not have a limit, and so might still be ratified — at least theoretically.The granddaddy of these ""zombie"" amendments was the very first among the Bill of Rights, which began with 12 items rather than 10. The proposed amendment sought to regulate the number of constituents to be represented by a member of the House, and its numbers were soon outdated. So it has never been ratified and presumably will not be.The one other amendment originally proposed in 1789 but not ratified as part of the original 10 amendments sat around for generations. Then it caught the attention of state legislatures in the late 1980s, at a time of popular reaction against pay raises for Congress. This amendment stated that a member of Congress who voted for a pay raise could not receive that raise until after the next election for the House of Representatives.That amendment was dusted off and recirculated, and it reached the ratification threshold in 1992, more than 200 years after it had first been proposed. It is now the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, and the last — at least so far.A new Constitutional Convention?If all this seems daunting, as it should, there is one alternative for changing the Constitution. That is the calling of a Constitutional Convention. This, too, is found in Article V of the Constitution and allows for a new convention to bypass Congress and address issues of amendment on its own.To exist with this authority, the new convention would need to be called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures.So if 34 states saw fit, they could convene their delegations and start writing amendments. Some believe such a convention would have the power to rewrite the entire 1787 Constitution, if it saw fit. Others say it would and should be limited to specific issues or targets, such as term limits or balancing the budget — or changing the campaign-finance system or restricting the individual rights of gun owners.There have been calls for an ""Article V convention"" from prominent figures on the left as well as the right. But there are those on both sides of the partisan divide who regard the entire proposition as suspect, if not frightening.One way or another, any changes made by such a powerful convention would need to be ratified by three-fourths of the states — just like amendments that might come from Congress.And three-fourths would presumably be as high a hurdle for convention-spawned amendments as it has been for those from Congress — dating to the 1700s."

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/business/media/paul-schweizer-google-facebook.html","Conservatives are zeroing in on a new enemy in the political culture wars: Big Tech.Arguing that Silicon Valley is stifling their speech and suppressing right-wing content, publishers and provocateurs on the right are eyeing a public-relations battle against online giants like Google and Facebook, the same platforms they once relied on to build a national movement.In a sign of escalation, Peter Schweizer, a right-wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton, plans to release a new film focusing on technology companies and their role in filtering the news.Tentatively titled “The Creepy Line,” Mr. Schweizer’s documentary is expected to have its first screening in May in Cannes, France — during the Cannes Film Festival, but not as part of the official competition. He used the same rollout two years ago for his previous film, an adaptation of his book “Clinton Cash” that he produced with Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News.“The Creepy Line” alludes to an infamous 2010 speech by Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google at the time, who dismissed concerns about privacy by declaring that his company’s policy was “to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it.”The documentary, which has not been previously reported, dovetails with concerns raised in recent weeks by right-wing groups about censorship on digital media — a new front in a rapidly evolving culture war.If the mainstream media is a perennial enemy of the right, Big Tech is a fresh and novel foe, arguably more relevant to 2018. Facebook, Google and their ilk are facing tough questions about their inability to police the content they distribute, including Russian propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. The companies have also been accused by lawmakers, critics and activists of monopolistic tendencies and manipulative product design.The critique from conservatives, in contrast, casts the big tech companies as censorious and oppressive, all too eager to stifle right-wing content in an effort to mollify liberal critics.“This could end up being the free speech issue of our time,” said Alex Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart News, which has published articles accusing Google and Facebook of, among other sins, political bias. “The Silicon Valley elites are saying: ‘We don’t care what you want to see — we know what you should see. We know better.’”Big Tech is easily associated with West Coast liberalism and Democratic politics, making it a fertile target for the right. And operational opacity at Facebook, Google and Twitter, which are reluctant to reveal details about their algorithms and internal policies, can leave them vulnerable, too.“It’s the perfect foil,” said Eli Pariser, a former executive director of the liberal activist group MoveOn.org and the author of “The Filter Bubble,” a book about how consumers find information online. “There’s not even a real basis to establish objective research about what’s happening on Facebook, because it’s closed.”Google, Facebook and Twitter loomed large at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., where dozens of guests squeezed into a standing-room-only ballroom for a discussion called “Suppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.”Among the panelists were James O’Keefe, the guerrilla filmmaker who has tried to undermine news outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN, and James Damore, an engineer fired by Google after he circulated a memo arguing that biological differences accounted for the low number of women in engineering.Mr. Damore — a new celebrity in the right-wing world, who, in an interview, said of his first foray to CPAC, “There’s definitely a lot of people that want to take selfies” — described a culture of dogmatic liberalism at Google.“There are political activists in all of these companies that want to actively push a liberal agenda,” he said. “Why does it matter? Because these companies are so ubiquitous and powerful that they are controlling all the means of mass communication.”Before Mr. Damore spoke, organizers distributed baseball caps to guests emblazoned with an illustration of Twitter’s bird logo, upside-down and with its eyes crossed out.The panelists accused social media platforms of delisting their videos or stripping them of advertising. Such charges have long been staples of far-right online discourse, especially among YouTubers, but Mr. Schweizer’s project is poised to bring such arguments to a new — and potentially larger — audience.Mr. Schweizer, 53, was a speechwriting consultant to President George W. Bush. His reporting has been cited by The Times and “60 Minutes,” although he often uses a bombastic style akin to that of Breitbart News.He is also the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit organization. He and Mr. Bannon founded it with funding from the family of Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund manager and donor to Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign.Mr. Schweizer declined to identify the film’s financial backers. A spokeswoman for the institute said it was not involved in the project.In some ways, the complaints from the right about Big Tech mirror the grumblings of legacy news organizations, which have expressed concern that online algorithms wield too much power over how readers gain access to their content.Jeffrey A. Zucker, the president of CNN, derided Google and Facebook as “monopolies” and called for regulators to step in during a speech in Spain last month, saying the tech hegemony is “the biggest issue facing the growth of journalism in the years ahead.” And former President Barack Obama said at an off-the-record conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last month that he worried Americans were living in “entirely different realities” and that large tech companies like Facebook were “not just an invisible platform, they’re shaping our culture in powerful ways.” The contents of the speech were published by Reason magazine.In the right’s more internet-savvy quarters, tech platforms have been a regular — and fruitful — subject of discussion since before the 2016 election. In May that year, Facebook was forced to respond to claims that the curators of its Trending Topics feature had suppressed conservative news sources, a controversy that called attention to Facebook’s editorial power.That charge of editorial bias was echoed last weekend by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, who accused YouTube of planning to delete his organization’s account, a claim that was widely shared among conservatives.YouTube did delete some videos that accused teenage survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting of being “crisis actors,” and it issued “strikes,” or warnings, to the accounts of Infowars and Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and Infowars contributor. (YouTube denied that it had plans to delete the Infowars account.)Facebook has also caught flak for adjusting  the algorithm for its News Feed to emphasize posts from “friends, family and groups” over content from public pages. The change was part of an effort by the company to answer criticism, but also to reinvigorate its oldest and most profitable product, which recently recorded a decline in American daily users for the first time in its history.The Facebook adjustment has affected virtually every media organization that is partly dependent on the platform for audiences, but it appears to have hit some harder than others. They include right-wing sites like Gateway Pundit and the millennial-focused Independent Journal Review, which was forced to lay off staff members last month.The social news giant BuzzFeed recently bought ads on Facebook with the message, “Facebook is taking the news out of your News Feed, but we’ve got you covered,” directing users to download its app. Away from the political scrum, the viral lifestyle site LittleThings, once a top publisher on the platform, announced last week that it would cease operations, blaming “a full-on catastrophic update” to Facebook’s revised algorithms.Right-wing media has pounced. In late February, citing statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip, Breitbart published an article on the effects on the president’s Facebook page with the headline “EXCLUSIVE: Trump’s Facebook Engagement Declined By 45 Percent Following Algorithm Change.” The drop, the article insinuated, occurred “following a year of pressure from left-wing employees and the mainstream media for ‘allowing’ the president to win the 2016 general election.”Still, the brewing backlash did not stop Google and Facebook from courting the very crowd that now seems ready to declare them enemies. Both companies were sponsors at this year’s CPAC, leading to a few awkward moments.Facebook, which sponsored a “help desk” for attendees featuring smiling representatives and cookies frosted with emoji icons, provided a demonstration of its virtual reality program, Oculus. But the company was forced to apologize for including a first-person shooter simulation, given that the conference took place a week after the Parkland massacre.Google, which has co-sponsored CPAC three of the past six years, held a lavish reception for attendees featuring an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.Mr. Marlow, the editor of Breitbart, was asked in an interview what he thought about Google’s giving a party in the midst of a crowd that is gunning for it.“The least they can do,” Mr. Marlow said, “is buy us a drink.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/nyregion/as-jurors-decide-fate-of-key-cuomo-ally-political-verdict-may-be-in.html","For Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the political damage, it seems, is already done.Over the last six weeks, federal prosecutors in Manhattan unspooled a streaming spectacle of unflattering tales of how Mr. Cuomo, 60, conducts himself and how his administration has conducted the people’s business in Albany.Witnesses and court records told stories of the governor’s pitching a screaming fit after an upstate development deal fell through; allowing Joseph Percoco, a former top aide and confidant who is one of four defendants on trial, to continue to use a state office and phone while he served as his campaign manager in 2014; being cajoled into talking cars, for a half-hour, with an executive of a company now accused of trying to bribe Mr. Percoco to do their bidding.State election laws were ignored or flouted, critics say, and campaign finance rules exploited to allow Mr. Cuomo’s donors to use multiple, anonymous companies to give amply to his coffers, a practice urged on by a longtime Cuomo associate.The governor has not been accused of illegal acts, and prosecutors and the federal judge in charge of the case, Judge Valerie E. Caproni, have stressed that the donations in question were legal. . Nonetheless, the corruption trial, which enters its fourth day of jury deliberations on Tuesday, may well tarnish the well-groomed reputation of Mr. Cuomo, a second-term Democrat facing re-election in the fall. It may also complicate or undercut any national ambitions, which would need to take flight in places like Iowa and New Hampshire next year.“Any time a close adviser or aide is charged with corruption reflects badly on a politician,” said Ben Tulchin, a pollster for Bernie Sanders during his presidential race. “It’s even worse if it’s New York: Voters in the heartland already have a jaded view of New York politics and politicians.”Other major Albany corruption trials will soon follow, including those of Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who was the longtime Assembly speaker, and Dean G. Skelos, a Republican who was the Senate majority leader. Both men are being retried after their convictions were overturned on appeal last year.In June, another former Cuomo ally, Alain E. Kaloyeros, the former president of the State University’s Polytechnic Institute, is to go on trial in yet another corruption case. The trial of Mr. Kaloyeros, who the governor once said was “as close as I’ve ever come to dealing with a genius,” involves bid-rigging in Mr. Cuomo’s signature upstate economic plan, the Buffalo Billion.There are some indications that the Percoco trial has hurt Mr. Cuomo’s popularity. A Quinnipiac University poll in mid-February found him with an approval rating of 47 percent. A whopping 63 percent said Mr. Cuomo should not run for president, including almost half the respondents from his own party.Mr. Cuomo has scrupulously avoided talking about the trial, saying he respects the legal process. He has held noticeably few public events in recent weeks, and has mostly avoided unscripted questions from the press.Democratic strategists said the corruption case was all but assured to be part of Mr. Cuomo’s national introduction, should he run for president, especially if Mr. Percoco were to be found guilty.Those looking to paint Mr. Cuomo as being ethically challenged have the benefit of an indelible catchword from the trial: “ziti,” the much-used code word that the prosecution contends Mr. Percoco and his fellow conspirator used to describe the under-the-table payments he received while serving as Mr. Cuomo’s campaign manager and senior aide.Here in New York, even before the jury returns its verdict, a collection of government watchdog groups have issued a scathing assessment of what-we-learned-at-trial, calling out “stunning failures in New York’s ethics oversight system” under Governor Cuomo. The groups also demanded answers to a series of questions raised by the trial, including why “so many high ranking officials were allowed to conduct business through personal emails,” something illustrated, again and again, during testimony.Indeed, the trial reinforced the Capitol’s shoddy reputation for ethics, something Mr. Cuomo promised to fix when he first ran for governor in 2010. Even then, however, the governor seemed willing to take advantage of donor’s generosity: testimony at trial showed that Mr. Cuomo, in the closing days of that campaign, used a private plane from a company, Competitive Power Ventures, r later accused of bribing Mr. Percoco. An executive with another company involved in the scandal, COR Development, a Syracuse-area developer, wooed Mr. Cuomo with talk of Corvettes at a fund-raiser for him, knowing his affinity for those sports cars.The Percoco trial also shed light on the use of sometimes shadowy limited liability companies to flood money into state campaigns, including those of Mr. Cuomo, who has been a major beneficiary of the so-called “L.L.C. loophole.” In one instance, the government’s star witness, Todd R. Howe, showed how COR, a company with business before the state, purposefully split contributions — and used nondescript names on the L.L.C.s — to hide their origin.While those activities were legal, the disclosures have been met with glee by the governor’s opponents, in particular the beleaguered state Republican Party.In a post on Twitter, Mr. Cuomo’s most outspoken Republican opponent, State Senator John DeFrancisco, said the trial illustrated how Mr. Cuomo “has sold his office to the highest bidder, engaging in shakedown schemes, exchanging government contracts for millions in campaign donations.” Mr. DeFrancisco wrote last week, “So pathetic, it would make Boss Tweed blush.”The chairman of the state Republican Party, Edward F. Cox, has asked a state ethics panel to investigate Mr. Cuomo, saying the governor has violated New York Public Officers Law, and has requested the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to also investigate.Mr. Cox, whose party has not won a statewide election in New York since 2002, saw parallels between Mr. Cuomo’s guilt-by-association and that of former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose proximity to the bridge-closing scandal known as Bridgegate helped dent his national profile.“This is the end of Governor Cuomo’s political future,” Mr. Cox said at a news conference last month before the steps of Federal District Court in Manhattan, where Mr. Percoco is being tried.That may be an overstatement; unlike Mr. Christie, whose former aides implicated him at trial for knowing of the decision to close bridge lanes, Mr. Cuomo has not been similarly besmirched.And officials with the state Democratic party, controlled by Mr. Cuomo, shot back at any suggestion that the governor would be hurt by the Percoco trial.“After years of investigation, there has never been a suggestion that the Governor or anyone else besides the people on trial did anything wrong,” said Geoff Berman, the party’s executive director, calling Mr. DeFrancisco “the Boss Tweed of Albany.”Indeed, with $30 million in the bank and no top-tier opponent in the contest, Mr. Cuomo remains a heavy favorite to win re-election this year. Among Democrats, no serious primary challenger has yet emerged, though two women, the former Syracuse mayor, Stephanie Miner, and the actress Cynthia Nixon, have publicly toyed with running.But if his ambitions extend to the White House in 2020 — and Mr. Cuomo has increasingly framed his agenda in national terms — the trial, especially if it ends in a conviction, threatens to muddy his core argument that he can be a capable and trusted custodian of the state, or especially, the country.“These kinds of things typically emerge either soon after he first announces or soon after he gains traction,” Mr. Tulchin said. “Assuming he gains any.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/climate/bloomberg-un-climate.html","Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter.The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, on Monday appointed a billionaire politician from New York to be his special envoy for climate action. It amounted to a finger in the eye of another New York billionaire: the one who occupies the White House and who has dismissed the fact of climate change.The appointment of Michael R. Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York City who is a prominent advocate in the fight against climate change, to the United Nations post comes a year ahead of a summit meeting on global warming that the secretary general is planning.“The world has those that follow and those that lead. And those that lead, some lead in the wrong direction and some lead in the right direction,” Mr. Guterres said at a news conference Monday at United Nations headquarters. “You are of those that lead and have always led in the right direction,” he told Mr. Bloomberg, “and it is an enormous privilege for me to be able to work so closely with you.”In a statement, Mr. Guterres said he had asked Mr. Bloomberg to help him encourage governments and private businesses to rapidly reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to meet the targets of the Paris climate accord.“The Secretary General and Michael Bloomberg share the perspective that the emissions gap needs to be closed soon to limit global temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius,” Mr. Guterres’s office said in a statement.President Trump has said the United States will pull out of the Paris climate agreement. He has rolled back a host of regulations to protect the environment, appointed climate science deniers to key posts in the administration and championed the use of fossil fuels, defying the scientific consensus that emissions from those fuels are a major cause of global warming.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump described climate change as a “hoax.”Mr. Bloomberg, who was mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013, has teamed up with one of Mr. Trump’s most outspoken critics, Gov. Jerry Brown of California, to press cities and states to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions to help the United States meet its Paris agreement targets.“For the United States to reach its commitment, much more needs to be done,” the two wrote in an opinion article published in The New York Times. “But the world should know: We are not waiting for Washington.”Mr. Bloomberg has given tens of millions of dollars to environmental groups fighting coal-fired power plants. In 2014, Ban Ki-moon, who was United Nations secretary general at the time, appointed him special envoy for cities and climate change.“Around the world, bottom-up solutions are leading the fight against climate change,” Mr. Bloomberg said in a Twitter post. “As the new @UN Special Envoy for Climate Action, I’ll work with state and non-state actors to help implement policies that reduce emissions & build resilience.”Mr. Guterres on Monday did not mention the Trump administration, but criticism was implicit in his remarks. How society reacts, he said, will make the difference in winning what he called “the battle against climate change.”“Governments are important, of course, because they can slow down this process, but the essential is the way societies as a whole react, and that is what Michael Bloomberg is leading in an exemplary way,” the secretary general said.Mr. Guterres has described Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris deal as “a major disappointment.” The United States is the only country in the world to have announced its intention to withdraw.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/06/591039154/5-laws-of-political-gravity-in-midterms-do-they-still-apply-in-the-age-of-trump","The 2018 election cycle has officially begun, with the first primaries being held in Texas on Tuesday.In every campaign cycle, analysts look at the fundamentals — the political laws of gravity that, in the past, have influenced elections. In 2016, Donald Trump seemed to defy a lot of these laws, and Republicans are hoping they can do the same this year to prevent the hit that the party in power usually takes in a president's first midterm.Here are five laws of political gravity to watch as the 2018 campaign plays out:1. When a president's approval rating is below 50 percent, his party doesn't fare well at allHistorically, parties that hold the White House lose seats in midterms — even more when they also have complete control of Congress, and even more when the president's approval rating is under 50 percent.The Republican Party has a bad news trifecta here.Since the Great Depression, when a president's approval rating has been below 50 percent in his first midterm, his party has lost an average of 41 House and five Senate seats.Midterms are a referendum on the president and his party. Trump is still popular with his base, but because he is so historically unpopular with so many other voters, his ability to help his fellow Republicans is diminished. His ""strongly disapprove"" numbers have been consistently higher than his ""strongly approve"" numbers.The latest tracking poll from Gallup showed that 39 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing, while 55 percent disapprove. And his approval rating in the RealClearPolitics average is a similar 40 percent approve, 56 percent disapprove.2. The party with the intensity and enthusiasm on its side winsDemocrats have it — and it's fueled by animus toward Trump, just like Republicans in 2010 and 2014 were motivated by antipathy to President Barack Obama. (Democrats lost a total of 76 House seats and 15 Senate seats in those two Obama-era midterms.)In the handful of special elections since 2016, and in the Virginia and New Jersey 2017 elections, Democratic turnout has been up. There are hundreds of new Democratic candidates running in races where Democrats have failed to field a candidate in the past, and polls consistently show that Democrats are more interested and enthusiastic about the 2018 campaign than Republicans.As The Washington Post noted Saturday, about 1,200 candidates had registered to run as Democrats for the House by the end of 2017 — a clear record for a single party and the first time since before the wave election of 2010 that Democrats outnumbered Republicans at the same point in an election cycle.3. When people are in a bad mood, the party in power suffersVoters' attitudes about the state of the country — Are we in a recession? Are we at war? — is always one of the most important factors.Americans remain pessimistic about the direction of the country. On average, just 35 percent think the country is headed in the right direction, while 56 percent think it is on the wrong track.And this year, the measurement isn't working the way it usually does in at least one big respect. The direction of the country and a president's approval rating is typically tied to voters' views about the economy. But right now, the economy is doing pretty well — with Americans' attitudes about the economy reaching a 17-year high in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll — and increasing numbers of people are saying they like the GOP tax cuts.So why isn't Trump more popular? In fact, he's suffering poor approval ratings with the very upper-middle-class, suburban voters who are probably benefiting the most from his tax cuts.Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report said that it's as if voters are saying to the president, ""Yeah, we feel good about the economy, but we don't really feel good about you.""There is a wild card on the economy — Trump's threatened tariffs and a possible trade war. On Monday, the president said that he didn't think there would be a trade war if he goes ahead with steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, but a few days earlier, he tweeted that ""trade wars are good, and easy to win.""Republicans worry Trump's tariffs could undermine the stock market and economic growth — two factors they have been counting on to help them in November.4. The party that has the structural advantages can sometimes mitigate damageThis is the bright spot for Republicans.Even though many Democratic candidates have raised impressive amounts of money to stock their war chests, Republicans have a lot more outside money than Democrats do. The Koch brothers' network of conservative donors alone have pledged to spend a whopping $400 million electing Republicans this year, 60 percent more than they spent in the 2016 presidential election.Many GOP congressional districts are also drawn to protect incumbents, and because Republicans control more state legislatures, they have overwhelmingly drawn those districts to advantage their party.Republicans are hoping the mighty fortress of redistricting will help them defend against a big blue wave — if one materializes. They are trying to fight back against a state court ruling in Pennsylvania that redrew the state's congressional district and is likely to eat into the GOP's 13-to-5 statewide advantage in House seats. But challenges to maps drawn by Republicans in Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan and North Carolina are unlikely to impact the 2018 election.5. The party that turns out their base usually winsWho actually comes out to vote is an important factor in any election — and it's hard to predict. But it's especially true in midterms, when activists traditionally dominate. Consider: There is about a 30 percent drop off in turnout from presidential to midterm years.In 2016, Donald Trump surprised a lot of political handicappers when he got more rural, white, working-class voters to the polls than most turnout models predicted. And things are often favorable for the GOP in a midterm.""The people who turn out the most tend to be older people, tend to be whiter people, tend to be people who are married, and tend to be people who are well educated,"" says demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution. ""Most of them tend to favor the Republicans.""But there's one flaw in that profile for Republicans — highly educated voters generally do not like Trump. In fact, more than half of white college graduates have strongly disapproved of him. And, since 2016, they have been turning out for Democrats.This will make it harder for Trump to help Republican candidates in the kind of suburban districts won by Hilary Clinton in 2016. The suburbs are precisely where Democrats are hoping to build their comeback. Clinton won 23 districts where a Republican was elected to the House in 2016. Democrats need to pick up a net of 24 seats to take back the House.What's more, Trump won independents in 2016, but they've flipped.To make up for it, Trump needs to turn out big numbers of his white, non-college-educated supporters to the polls this year — just like he did when he defied the odds two years ago.""Coalitions that are built in presidential elections don't always translate into midterm elections,"" Walter points out. ""Just ask Democrats who were counting on the Obama coalition of 2008 to come out in 2010. They didn't."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/591001865/ex-trump-campaign-aide-vows-to-fight-mueller-subpoena-in-tv-tirades","Updated on March 6 at 11:45 a.m. ETA former campaign aide to Donald Trump appears to have changed his mind and will not fight a subpoena he says he has received in the Russia investigation — after daring special counsel Robert Mueller to arrest him in multiple media appearances.Sam Nunberg called reporters and TV news programs on Monday and said live that he'd gotten a grand jury subpoena as part of Mueller's investigation asking for communications with other people in the Trump orbit — but that he would not comply.""Let him arrest me,"" Nunberg told The Washington Post. ""Mr. Mueller should understand I am not going in.""Nunberg then went on multiple MSNBC and CNN shows to publicize his refusal to comply with the Mueller probe. He said he had been summoned to appear before a grand jury on Friday but would not, nor would he produce evidence.What followed was a rambling, at-times incoherent series of exchanges as Nunberg asked for legal advice, opined about whether Trump colluded with Russia, and relitigated an internal Trump campaign power struggle from 2015 — all live, on the air, in real time.""I think that [Trump] may have done something during the election,"" Nunberg told MSNBC's Katy Tur, adding later, ""I don't know that for sure.""""I'm not cooperating,"" Nunberg said. ""Arrest me.""Nunberg is a lawyer who has been admitted to the New York state bar after graduating from Touro Law Center on Long Island, N.Y. All the same, he asked for legal advice from various cable news show hosts: ""What do you think Mueller's going to do to me?"" he asked Tur.""Do you think I should cooperate?"" Nunberg asked CNN's Jake Tapper. ""Why do I have to produce every email? I talk to [former Trump advisers] Steve Bannon and Roger Stone eight times a day.""""Sometimes life and special prosecutors are not fair,"" Tapper quipped.Discussing the request from the Mueller team in an interview with the Associated Press later on Monday, Nunberg said he was ""going to end up cooperating with them.""In the Whitewater investigation during the Clinton administration, an Arkansas business associate of Bill Clinton's, Susan McDougal, spent 18 months in prison for not complying with a grand jury subpoena. McDougal spoke about Nunberg to the Washington Post on Monday, advising him, ""If you don't want to testify, don't go on television and do these teaser interviews."" Nunberg also accused former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page of having played a role in the foreign attack on the election.""I believe Carter Page was colluding with the Russians,"" Nunberg said on CNN.Page was a junior foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. He traveled to Moscow twice in 2016 and was the subject of surveillance by the U.S. intelligence community. Page stridently denies doing anything wrong.He and Nunberg never overlapped on the Trump campaign. The campaign fired Nunberg in the summer of 2015, when Trump's candidacy was still in its infancy. Business Insider had written about Nunberg's racially charged Facebook posts from years prior, and the nascent political organization jettisoned him.At the time, Nunberg's firing was viewed as part of a broader struggle between Trump aides Corey Lewandowski and Roger Stone. Nunberg decided to relitigate this on Monday.""Corey wanted to push us out. That's the reality. Now Trump loves Corey. I don't know why he does,"" Nunberg said.By December of that year, Nunberg was saying that Trump's campaign was being led in the wrong direction and predicted that Trump would not win the Republican nomination. By March 2016, Nunberg had endorsed Trump opponent Ted Cruz. The drama continued into the summer of 2016, when Trump sued his former aide for $10 million, alleging Nunberg broke his nondisclosure agreement. After a time, that lawsuit was settled."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/06/ex-trump-aides-bizarre-anti-mueller-media-blitz-begins-with-bang-defiance-ends-with-whimper.html","The former Trump campaign aide who became a television spectacle Monday in a series of bizarre news interviews -- vowing to defy a grand jury subpoena and daring Special Counsel Robert Mueller to “arrest me” -- is now toning down his dramatic rhetoric.""I'm going to end up cooperating with them,"" the aide, Sam Nunberg, told the Associated Press.In an unusual and risky move, Nunberg hit the interview circuit Monday to lash out at the special counsel after receiving a subpoena to appear before a grand jury for the Russia investigation.'LET HIM ARREST ME': TRUMP EX-CAMPAIGN AIDE NUNBERG SAYS HE WILL REFUSE MUELLER'S SUBPOENABut a defiant Nunberg went public with his anger regarding that request, saying: “Let him arrest me.”During one interview on CNN, host Erin Burnett told Nunberg she “smelled alcohol” on his breath. Nunberg denied he had been drinking.He’s long been associated with Stone, the infamous political dirty trickster who has also had a tumultuous relationship as an on-again, off-again adviser to Trump.SAM NUNBERG: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE FORMER TRUMP AIDENunberg said Monday he believes the only reason he's being asked to testify before the grand jury is to provide information that would be used against Stone, which he says he won't do.“I’m not spending 80 hours going over my emails with Roger Stone and Steve Bannon and producing them,” Nunberg said. “Donald Trump won this election on his own. He campaigned his ass off. And there is nobody who hates him more than me.”In other interviews, Nunberg said he thought Mueller may already have incriminating evidence on Trump directly, although he would not say what that evidence might be.He later told CNN that Mueller ""thinks Trump is the Manchurian candidate."" A reference drawn from a Cold War novel and film, a ""Manchurian candidate"" is an American brainwashed or otherwise compromised to work on behalf of an adversarial government.Shortly after Nunberg lobbed the first allegation, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders rebuffed him during her Monday press briefing.""I definitely think he doesn't know that for sure because he's incorrect. As we've said many times before, there was no collusion with the Trump campaign,"" Sanders said. ""He hasn't worked at the White House, so I certainly can't speak to him or the lack of knowledge that he clearly has.""During his afternoon tirades, Nunberg detailed his interview with Mueller's investigators, mocking them for asking such questions as if he had heard Russian being spoken in Trump Tower. ""I think it would be funny if they arrested me,"" Nunberg said on MSNBC.He later added on CNN: ""I'm not going to the grand jury. I'm not going to spend 30 hours going over my emails. I'm not doing it.""Nunberg said he'd already blown a 3 p.m. Monday deadline to turn over the requested communications. He said he'd traded numerous emails a day with Stone and Bannon, and said spending 80 hours digging through his inbox to find them all was unreasonable.A source close to the Trump campaign told Fox News on Monday that Nunberg was fired twice by Trump “for good reason” and was known to be erratic, referring to his media appearances Monday.Nunberg was first fired by Trump in 2014 after an unflattering piece about Trump ran in BuzzFeed as he geared up for a presidential run. Nunberg, a communications aide, helped to arrange the interview and Trump blamed him for the bad press.Nunberg was re-hired for the campaign, but was fired again by Trump in 2015, after past racially-charged Facebook posts surfaced.Later during the campaign, Trump sued Nunberg for $10 million, accusing him of breaching a confidentiality agreement. The lawsuit was later settled.Nunberg was featured in the recent Michael Wolff book “Fire and Fury” and recently sat for a voluntary interview with Mueller.Fox News' Catherine Herridge and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/06/texas-holds-first-2018-primary-amid-surge-democratic-voters.html","The midterm election season officially kicks off on Tuesday, when Texas voters head to the polls for the nation’s first primary of 2018.With early voting already suggesting a record turnout for Democrats, and widespread speculation about what effect an endorsement by President Trump will have on Republican candidates, the Texas primaries are being looked at as both a bellwether for the rest of the nation - and a sign the red state could be turning purple more quickly than expected.“What these primaries really boil down to is one issue: Trump versus anti-Trump,” Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, told Fox News. “There is relatively little talk about the issues for either party. It’s a race to the margins. Democrats are all against the president, while with Republicans it’s about staying close to Trump, and whether that hurts or helps them.”""I want to encourage all of my many Texas friends to vote in the primary for Governor Greg Abbott, Senator Ted Cruz, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, and Attorney General Ken Paxton. They are helping me to Make America Great Again! Vote early or on March 6th,"" Trump tweeted.Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush also got Trump’s endorsement, with the president saying the nephew and grandson of two former presidents “backed me when it wasn't the politically correct thing to do, and I back him now.”It remains to be seen whether a Trump endorsement will hurt or help Bush. But either way, it puts the politician in a strange situation as he tries to merge the backing of the anti-establishment president with that of his storied political family. The Bush dynasty was built on moderate conservative policy positions, and was strongly against Trump in the 2016 race, where George P.’s father, Jeb, ran against him.A recent poll from UT Austin/Texas Tribune found 83 percent of Texas Republicans supportive of Trump.Experts say Republicans will need a big turnout if the party hopes to counter the groundswell of interest for the Democrats.The early numbers also indicate that for the first time since 2008, more Texas Democrats will vote in their primary than Republicans. By Saturday, the Texas Secretary of State’s office noted 465,000 people voted in the Democratic Primary in the state’s 15 largest counties, compared to just about 420,000 Republicans.There are a number of reasons for the uptick in Democratic voter turnout – more female candidates, the emergence of closet Democrats and a dislike of both Trump and the socially conservative Texas Republican Party – and analysts say this should worry Republicans.“This Democratic surge looks really impressive,” Jillson said. “Having Democratic turnout surpass Republicans is a big deal in Texas, and should have the GOP scared.”Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, for example, is likely to face Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke who, despite being a fundraising powerhouse and an emerging party favorite, is not considered a true contender. A recent Texas Politics Project poll found nearly 40 percent of Texas voters have no idea who O’Rourke even is.“The Democratic surge will show some results, but not enough to flip the state,” Jillson said. “They’re on a slow march, but unless the GOP fumbles this election really badly, Texas will not turn blue.” "

As secretary of state, Clinton chose to use a private, non-secure server for government business.A report from Horowitz’s 14-month investigation into the DOJ and FBI’s handling of the Clinton email case is expected at any time.In December, when the texts between Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page became public, congressional sources said Strzok was part of then FBI Director James Comey's inner circle, who advised and made edits to Comey's July 2016 public statement recommending against criminal charges in the Clinton probe.The edits addressed the likelihood the Clinton server had been compromised. In the initial May 2016 draft, two months before Clinton and more than a dozen key witnesses were interviewed, Comey said it was “reasonably likely” that “hostile actors” gained access to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email account. That was later changed to say the scenario was merely “possible.”In his July 2016 statement, Comey said: “With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked. But, given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence.”Comey said hostile actors got access to private accounts of Clinton’s close contacts. He also said Clinton’s use of personal email was widely known, her email address was readily apparent and she used the account while travelling overseas where hostile nations and sophisticated hackers operate.“Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail account,” Comey said at the time.Another key edit, which appeared to limit Clinton's legal exposure, included changing the language to describe the former Secretary of State's actions from “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless.”  This is a key legal distinction because, under the federal criminal statute 18 USC 793, the legal standard is gross negligence.“110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received,” Comey said in his July 2016 statement about the Clinton case. “Eight of those chains contained information that was top secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained secret information at the time; and eight contained confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification.”"

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/06/sam-nunberg-very-sad-story-instant-media-darling.html","Yes, the whole tale is really pretty sad. Weird, sure – totally bizarre, even – but in the end, just sad.Sam Nunberg burst onto America's airwaves Monday, showing up on nearly every network, sometimes more than once. The former aide to not-yet-candidate Donald Trump had made big news: He vowed to ignore a subpoena from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.But Nunberg went much further, telling CNN: ""Trump may have very well done something during the election with the Russians.""Nunberg was everywhere from mid-afternoon into the evening. But by the end, the whole story unraveled. In one interview, Nunberg took credit for being the brains behind Trump's winning campaign, saying: ""I came up with the wall, I came up with the Muslim ban, I came up with everything to attack Jeb Bush, all that stuff."" Trump went out of his way to knock Nunberg. And Nunberg was called a “low-level, part-time consultant"" by the campaign after his firing. “Sam Nunberg was fired. He’s a highly self-destructive individual who makes routine calls begging for his job back,” Trump told The Daily Beast in December 2015 after Nunberg said in an interview that Trump wouldn't win the GOP nomination. “This is the interview of a desperate person who is trying to hang on and stay relevant.”As the day wore on Monday, with Nunberg acting more bizarre – during one phone interview he got another call and actually said ""let me take this for two seconds, OK?"" His friends began to get worried, the Daily Beast reported. They were worried Nunberg ""had been drinking prior to dialing in to MSNBC and CNN.""When Nunberg appeared on CNN's ""Out Front"" with Erin Burnett, he went on a rant about Trump and Mueller. Burnett was put off immediately.“You’ve done six interviews this the past four hours,” Burnett said. “‘Bizarre’ was a word that some White House officials were using to describe some of your interviews. ‘Nuts’ is another one.… I reached out to a Trump ally. This person told me ... ‘you’re drunk or off your meds.’ At least half a dozen other CNN reporters have received similar messages. Is this a hit job or is something wrong?”Later, Burnett pushed harder. ""You're sitting very close to me, we talked earlier about what people in the White House were saying about you.... Talking to you, I have smelled alcohol on your breath,"" Burnett said.""Well, I have not had a drink,"" Nunberg said.""Anything else?"" Burnett asked.""No. No,"" Nunberg said. ""Besides my meds,"" he added, smiling. ""Anti-depressants. Is that OK?""As Burnett pointed out, many Washington insiders knew by then that something was askew with Nunberg. And yet they still quoted him – a ""low-level part-time consultant"" who Trump fired twice, most recently more than a year before the presidential election.MSNBC's Katy Tur asked Nunberg: “Do you think that they have something on the president?"" “I think they may,” Nunberg said. “I think that he may have done something during the election."" And MSNBC ran with the ""story"" all day, over and over again.Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei, two veteran journalists formerly of the Washington Post and Politico and now at Axios, dissected the whole spectacle.""Here's what it was: A sad, epic meltdown – a troubled Trump flunky, pecked at and picked apart like roadkill on the Russia Interstate, in his last gasps of public fame and shame."" And the pair wrote that ""one of Nunberg's friends was furious, telling Axios that the anchors were knowingly taking advantage of an obviously fragile man.""""'What the hell is wrong with you people? ... Shame on you. This isn't news,'"" the friend told them.And so, it was all very sad. The networks – desperate for any dirt on Trump, from anyone! – put someone on their air repeatedly who they knew, or should have known, was, as his friend said, an ""obviously fragile man.""Which prompted Allen and VandeHei to conclude: ""This is one of the reasons America hates the media. Our entire industry lit itself on fire because a troubled Trump hanger-on made an ass of himself – live."""

This is beyond the pale,"" he said.One Mexican citizen had convictions for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor and a conviction for driving under the influence (DUI), and had been deported in 2003.Another who evaded capture had a conviction for sodomizing a drugged victim in 2012, as well as a DUI from this year -- that Mexican citizen had also been previously deported in 2013.Another illegal immigrant from Mexico, previously deported in 2014 for a conviction for armed robbery, also evaded capture.While the individuals dodged authorities, it is also not clear if there was a definitive link between Schaaf’s statement and their disappearance.An official briefed on the plans at the Department of Homeland Security told The New York Times that ICE agents typically find only about 30 percent of their targets during a sweep, meaning that many of the 800 who evaded capture may not have been caught either way.Schaaf came under intense national pressure, including from the White House, for her actions. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the DOJ was conducting a review. But Schaaf stood by what she did.""I did what I believe was right for my community as well as to protect public safety,"" Schaaf said Friday, according to NBC Bay Area. ""People should be able to live without fear or panic and know their rights and responsibilities as well as their recourses.""Among those caught in the raid were immigrants with a lengthy list of convictions, including aggravated assault, murder, hit-run, lewd acts with a minor, burglary, cruelty toward a child, indecent exposure, domestic violence, drug trafficking, battery, sex offenses and false imprisonment.In a press release, ICE pointed to the case of Armando Nunez-Salgado, a Mexican gang member who had been deported four times and had convictions including assault with a deadly weapon, burglary, hit-and-run causing injury and evasion of a police officer.Another deportee was a Mexican gang member with convictions for, among other things, possession of a dangerous weapon, spousal abuse, burglary and battery on a police officer.“Recent legislation has negatively impacted ICE operations in California by nearly eliminating all cooperation and communication with our law enforcement partners in the state by prohibiting local law enforcement from contracting with the federal government to house detainees,” the statement said.“Ultimately, efforts by local politicians have shielded removable criminal aliens from immigration enforcement and created another magnet for more illegal immigration, all at the expense of the safety and security of the very people it purports to protect,” it said.  "

In fact, Kellyanne’s statements actually show her intention and desire to comply with the Hatch Act – as she twice declined to respond to the host’s specific invitation to encourage Alabamans to vote for the Republican.”Appearing on Fox News on Nov. 20, Conway touted President Trump’s tax plan before taking aim at Jones.“Doug Jones in Alabama, folks, don’t be fooled,” Conway said at the time. “He’ll be a vote against tax cuts. He’s weak on crime, weak on borders. He’s strong on raising your taxes. He’s terrible for property owners. And Doug Jones is a doctrinaire liberal which is why he’s not saying anything and the media are trying to boost him.”“Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade asked Conway, “So vote Roy Moore?”Conway replied, “I’m telling you that we want the votes in the Senate to get this tax bill through.”The report also faults Conway for a Dec. 6 appearance on CNN’s New Day, when also she discussed the race.The Office of Special Counsel said it submitted the report to President Trump so he could take “appropriate disciplinary action.”The agency says Conway did not respond to requests from the Office of Special Counsel to respond to the allegations.“Ms. Conway’s statements during the Fox & Friends and New Day interviews impermissibly mixed official government business with political views about candidates in the Alabama special election for U.S. Senate,” the report states.Fox News’  John Roberts, Joseph Weber and Barnini Chakraborty contributed to this report."

Rob Forrest, the former head of her security detail. Forrest, who was also married, resigned in January.The revelation of the affair derailed the first term of a mayor who was seen a rising star among Democrats.Metro Nashville Police records show Forrest's overtime more than doubled in the budget year after Barry was elected in September 2015. Barry said the affair began in spring 2016, according to an affidavit.Barry agreed to resign as part of a plea deal.""It has been the privilege of my entire professional life to have the blessing and opportunity to be your mayor,"" she said. ""God bless this wonderful city. I love you, Nashville."" In a statement, Barry said if photographs were taken of her, it was done without her knowledge or consent.“The allegations of photos taken of myself are very troubling and infuriating if true,"" Barry said in a statement, calling the act a ""complete invasion of my privacy.""The photos appear to be taken with Forrest’s phone while he was in Washington, D.C., with Barry on two occasions, according to The Tennessean.Aside from photos, investigators uncovered 260 deleted messages between him and Barry as well as nearly three dozen deleted phone calls.“I accept full responsibility for the pain I have caused my family and his. I am so sorry to my husband Bruce, who has stood by me in my darkest moments and remains committed to our marriage, just as I am committed to repairing the damage I have done,” Barry said in a statement.“While I regret any distractions that will be caused by my actions, I remain firmly committed to working hard to serve the people of Nashville now and into the future,” she continued. “God will forgive me, but the people of Nashville don’t have to. In the weeks and months to come, I will work hard to earn your forgiveness and earn back your trust.”Both Forrest and Barry are married. Forrest accompanied Barry to many of her public events, including on trips abroad, according to The Tennessean.Forrest resigned from the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department effective Jan. 31, WZTV reported. He will receive $80,000 per year in pension, according to the station.“We cannot begin to describe the pain and heartbreak that comes with losing our only child. Our son was a kind soul full of life and love for his family and friends,” Max's parents said.Barry spoke publicly about her son's overdose during a press conference on Aug. 7, 2017, encouraging parents to have tough conversations with their kids about drugs and to discuss her plans to combat the nation's opioid crisis.""This is not an unfamiliar nationwide or community conversation,"" Barry said.

He praised the ""possible progress"" but remained cautious.The Hermit Kingdom added that it’s willing to give up its nuclear weapons if military threats against North Korea subsides, Chung said hours after leaving Pyongyang.WHAT KIM JONG UN’S SISTER REALLY MEANS WHEN CALLING FOR NORTH AND SOUTH ‘UNIFICATION’North and South Korea agreed to hold summit talks in April at the border. The leaders will establish a “hotline” communication channel to lower military tensions, Chung added.“North Korea threatens the entire global community through its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs and proliferation activities, including its arms exports to Africa. It doesn’t just involve our allies in Europe or Asia. It doesn’t just include countries with longstanding ties to [North Korea] like China and Russia. This is and must be a global effort,"" Tillerson said in a speech at George Mason University. The comments mark a major change in tone after months of bombastic threats by the rogue regime to keep developing its nuclear and missile program. Last month’s Pyeongchang Olympics sparked the first talks between the two Koreas that followed a flurry of cooperative steps taken to ease tensions during the Winter Games.North Korea sent a delegation of athletes, cheerleaders, art troupe members and officials to Pyeongchang for the Olympics. Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, labeled by the South’s media as “Kim Jong Un’s Ivanka,” attended the opening ceremony and met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in over a three-day visit. At one point, she even wrote of her “wishes” for closer ties in a guest book at South Korea’s presidential office.""I expect Pyongyang and Seoul to get closer in the hearts of our [Korean] people and the future of unification and prosperity will be advanced,"" Kim wrote in Korean in the guest book, according to Yonhap News Agency.KIM JONG UN'S HARD CURRENCY EXPECTED TO RUN DRY BY OCTOBER, SOUTH KOREAN LAWMAKER SAYSBut the “future of unification” phrase means something far more sinister for the Kim family and his regime. North Korea has touted unification as a “final victory” to the Korean War that ended in an armistice in 1953. In Pyongyang’s view, ""unification"" means Kim’s brutal dictatorship would overcome the South’s government.There have been two summits, one in 2000 and another in 2007, held between Kim's late father, Kim Jong Il, and two liberal South Korean presidents. They resulted in a series of cooperative projects between the Koreas that were scuttled during subsequent conservative administrations in South Korea.Kim’s apparent olive branch to South Korea and the U.S. comes after months of mounting sanctions against the volatile regime. Kang Seok-ho, of the Liberty Korea Party, previously said the despot is scrambling to keep his regime afloat best the international sanctions was crippling his economy.""I received an analysis that, if international sanctions against the North continue like this, all of North Korea's foreign currency earnings and overseas assets will be frozen, and its dollar [reserves] will dry up around October,"" Kang said. ""At a time like this, our government should further strengthen cooperation with the international community on sanctions against the North.""Tillerson also said in mid-January there was “a lot of evidence that these sanctions are starting to hurt” North Korea.The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/06/trump-wants-to-cut-trade-deficit-if-does-ll-create-lot-us-jobs.html","Of all the economic policies President Trump has marked for attention this year – merit-based immigration, infrastructure and vocational training – fixing the trade deficit offers the biggest bang for the buck. Cutting the $620 billion annual trade gap in half could create 2 million jobs.Manufacturing would benefit most, and it finances two-thirds of business research and development. Investments in intellectual property for new materials, supply chain management, artificial intelligence and the like could boost long-term economic growth by a full percentage point.China accounts for 60 percent of the U.S. trade deficit and habitually subsidizes domestic industries, limits imports in areas of rapidly advancing technology to incubate its own competitors, and forces foreign multinationals to transfer technology as a condition for market access. It compels their compliance with the Communist Party political agenda and insidious activities monitoring its citizens.Whatever the U.S. does regarding China affects our allies, and the proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum have attracted strong rebuke and threats of retaliation on our exports from our friends. Lost in all the media coverage is the fact that the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements provide for a national security exception when the survival of critical domestic industries is threatened.Still, rifle-shot remedies, absent a comprehensive strategy, do pose the danger of casting the Americans, not the Chinese, as malefactors in the eyes of world leaders. President Trump needs their cooperation to accomplish a radical change in commercial relations with China.President Trump has linked an exception to the tariffs on steel and aluminum for Canada and Mexico to bringing the negotiations to modernize NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) to a quicker conclusion. However, some U.S. expectations for these talks are particularly maddening – for example, that Mexico and Canada agree to eliminate arbitration panels to resolve investor disputes.Those provisions protect U.S. companies from arbitrary foreign government actions – such as requirements to source components locally instead of from U.S. factories, coerced technology transfers and arbitrary treatment by foreign courts – and likely reduce, not increase, the U.S. trade deficit.Coming up with a fresh approach to China, in concert with the European Union and other allies requires a wholesale rethinking of our WTO relationship with the Middle Kingdom.The global trade body was conceived to be a club of market economies. Its dispute settlement mechanism is designed to rein in national industrial policies that occasionally harm other members – namely, discipline the venial sins of market economy governments.China is not a market economy. It was admitted into the WTO on the premise that greater engagement with the West would accelerate market-oriented reforms, but Beijing’s success at flaunting the rules has taken it in the opposite direction.China’s violations of WTO rules are far more sweeping than anything the dispute settlement mechanism was designed to handle. It’s time to recognize that China will never be a market economy compatible with fair competition, and Western nations would do well to impose a regime that balances its trade with the West.The Trump administration is reported to be fashioning a broad response to China. It would do well to deal with both the investment and trade holistically.America should impose across-the-board restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States that mirror Beijing’s policies toward U.S. investments in China.On trade, the United States should impose a system of licenses on imports from China and encourage its allies to do the same. Exporters would be granted transferable rights to imports equal to their sales in China.This would balance trade with China, and a system of re-sellable licenses would let the market decide which Chinese imports are most highly valued by consumers and aid U.S. exporters. And it would obviate the need of global tariffs that swipe at U.S. trading partners as well as China.If China wants to talk trade after that we can engage Beijing in long negotiations while its businesses acclimate to being treated as their government treats U.S. businesses."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/06/what-is-daca-and-what-does-trump-administration-want-to-do-with-it.html","President Trump and lawmakers are still struggling to come up with a plan for the hundreds of thousands of young, undocumented immigrants living in the United States.In September, the Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) – which provides a level of amnesty to certain undocumented immigrants, many of whom came to the U.S. as children – with a six-month delay for recipients. Trump set a deadline of March 5 as the end date for the DACA program, but a lower court ordered the administration to continue to accept renewal applications indefinitely. The U.S. Supreme Court declined in late February to take up the administration's request for an appeal of the order that requires the continuing acceptance of renewal applications.Individuals were able to request DACA status if they were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, came to the U.S. before turning 16 and continuously lived in the country since June 15, 2007.Individuals also had to have a high school diploma, GED certification, been honorably discharged from the military or still be in school. Recipients could not have a criminal record.It did not provide “legal status.”Thousands of people could lose their jobs if the DACA program is rescinded permanently, according to a study by left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress.Daniel Garza, president of the conservative immigration nonprofit Libre Initiative, told Fox News that DACA offers a “reprieve from a life of uncertainty for innocent kids who didn’t break the law.”“It’s rather disappointing to think they could return to a state of anxiety and fear,” he said.While the courts’ decisions have relieved much of the urgency surrounding the March 5 deadline, there are nearly 22,000 people whose initial applications have yet to be decided and are at risk until their petitions are granted.Since the announcement, Trump has offered to work with lawmakers on a solution for the hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. who fell under DACA’s umbrella of protections. But he has also repeatedly blamed Democrats on social media for lack of a solution. Earlier this year, Trump released his “four pillars” of immigration reform, which included a provision for legal status for DACA recipients and others who would be eligible for DACA status. The White House estimated that total to be 1.8 million people. The Senate rejected the plan.Republicans – and some Democrats – opposed Obama’s directive establishing DACA from the start as a perceived overreach of executive power.Obama spoke out on social media after the Trump administration announced a plan to dismantle the program, stating that it's ""self-defeating ... and it is cruel"" to end DACA and questioned the motive behind the decision. In fiscal year 2016, 359 DACA recipients had enlisted in the Army – which is the only branch to accept immigrants of this category.A Department of Defense official said in April that the military would continue to accept noncitizen recruits, but it is unclear if that will continue to be the case.The Associated Press contributed to this report.  "

It didn't take long for players across the country to follow his lead.President Trump made his position clear from the beginning.A football field is not the place to stage a protest, Trump has argued on several occasions, especially one that involves ""disrespecting"" the American flag and the nation's veterans.There is no official directive, but the agents said it's understood that the team isn’t going to pursue anyone who participated in the protests, the paper reported.The team slammed the ""categorically false"" report days later, saying it was ""without merit.""""A recent report that suggests the Houston Texans would not sign a player who has protested in support of social justice issues is categorically false and without merit. The Texans ownership, coaching, personnel and executive staff sign and hire employees based on talent, character and fit within our organization,"" the Texans responded in a statement. Once again, Trump called out NFL players for kneeling, retweeting a meme that depicted a widow laying on a soldier's grave. ""Show this picture to the NFL players who still kneel,"" Trump posted on Jan. 4.Trump also took a subtle swipe at the NFL during his first State of the Union address on Jan. 31.He didn't mention the NFL by name, but he did thank one of his special guests, 12-year-old Preston Sharp, for reminding Americans why it's important to stand for the national anthem.The boy from Redding, California, started the Flag and Flower Challenge in 2015 and has helped facilitate the placement of more than 40,000 American flags and flowers on veterans' graves.“Preston's reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem,” Trump said.Former NFL running back Herschel Walker weighed in on the protests on Feb. 2, two days before Super Bowl LII. ""The league gave the players a large sum of money toward their cause. That's hush money,"" he told Fox and Friends. ""Guys should have been standing at the very beginning.""Walker said the league needs ""good leadership"" to put an end to the national anthem protests once and for all, adding that he doesn't believe Kaepernick would have protested if he was starting quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, rather than the backup, during the 2016 season.""There's no doubt black lives matter, but I don't think you can protest on your job,"" Walker said. ""Your First Amendment right should be, 'I want to stand for our military.'""He sat during the Star-Spangled Banner -- but when the Mexican national anthem played, he was back on his feet.Trump shared his disapproval on Twitter, requesting that Lynch be suspended for the move.“Marshawn Lynch of the NFL’s Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect!” Trump tweeted. “Next time NFL should suspend him for the remainder of the season. Attendance and ratings way down.”Ten days later, the NFL announced a commitment to donate $90 million to social justice causes during the following seven years in response to national anthem demonstrations.”The NFL’s work will encompass programs and initiatives that reduce barriers to opportunity, with a priority on supporting improvements in education, community/police relations and our criminal justice system,"" Anna Isaacson, the league’s vice president for social responsibility, wrote in a memo obtained by The Associated Press. ""Additional focus areas include poverty, racial equality and workforce development.”""I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,"" Pence tweeted shortly after exiting the stadium.On Oct. 10, 2017, Goodell sent a letter to the NFL's owners about the possibility of a rule change that would force players to stand during the national anthem.""The current dispute over the National Anthem is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country,” Goodell wrote, noting that he respects players' right to free speech. “We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.""""We can't have the inmates running the prison,"" Houston Texans owner Bob McNair said during a closed meeting of NFL owners and executives to discuss national anthem protests.McNair later apologized after receiving backlash for the remark.""I regret that I used that expression,"" he said in a statement. ""I never meant to offend anyone and I was not referring to our players.""""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say 'get that son of a b**** off the field right now - he's fired,'"" Trump said at a rally for then-Senator Luther Strange in Alabama. ""You know, some owner's going to do that.""Goodell released a statement the next day, saying Trump's comments demonstrated a ""lack of respect"" for the league.Two days after Trump's remarks, three NFL teams — the Tennessee Titans, Seattle Seahawks and Pittsburgh Steelers — stayed in their locker rooms during the national anthem.Villanueva later regretted the move and apologized for ""unintentionally"" throwing his teammates under the bus.“I made my teammates look bad, and that’s my fault, and my fault only,” Villanueva told reporters during a news conference. “We as a team tried to figure it out, but obviously butchered it.”Trump said he felt compelled to speak out against the NFL protests on Sept. 26, 2017, after visiting injured soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.""They were fighting for our flag, they were fighting for our national anthem,” Trump said during a press conference at the White House. “For people to disrespect that by kneeling during the playing of our national anthem I think is disgraceful.”NFL players were quick to respond.More than a dozen players with the Cleveland Browns kneeled and bowed their heads in silent prayer when the anthem was played ahead of a preseason game against the New York Giants on Sept. 29, 2017.The protest was the largest the NFL had seen since Kaepernick kicked off the trend the previous season.It was a photo shared across the web: Marshawn Lynch — at his first game on Aug. 12, 2017, as an Oakland Raider — sitting on an orange cooler with his elbows resting on his knees as his teammates stood around him during the national anthem.A day later, Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett sat on the bench as his teammates linked arms during the national anthem before their game against the Los Angeles Chargers.""I just like what he’s doing, and I’m standing behind him,"" Lane told ESPN. ""It’s something I plan on keep on doing, until I feel like justice is being served.""The next day, San Francisco 49ers safety Eric Reid dropped to one knee to protest racial injustice and police brutality alongside Kaepernick during the national anthem at the Chargers' Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego.The teammates were met with boos from the crowd as a naval officer sang the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" while dozens of military members rolled out an American flag across the field.On Sept. 8, 2016, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters he disagreed with Kaepernick's decision to kneel during the national anthem, but said he had to respect the player's right to protest.""I don't necessarily agree with what he is doing,"" Goodell told The Associated Press via email. ""I support our players when they want to see change in society, and we don't live in a perfect society. On the other hand, we believe very strongly in patriotism in the NFL. I personally believe very strongly in that.""The protests only continued to grow in the following days.Kansas City cornerback Marcus Peters raised a black-gloved fist, four Miami Dolphins — Arian Foster, Michael Thomas, Jenkins and Kenny Stills — kneeled with hands on their hearts, Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall took a knee and New England's Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty both held up their right arms during the national anthem on Sept. 11, 2016.Several other teams, including the Chiefs and Seahawks, also saw players link arms when the anthem was played.Two weeks later, on Aug. 26, 2016, Kaepernick made headlines for sitting during the national anthem before his preseason debut against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.NFLFemale.com's Jennifer Lee Chan was one of the first reporters to capture a photo of Kaepernick sitting during the national anthem. Mike Garafolo, a reporter for the NFL Network, was quick to point out it wasn't the NFL player's first protest.For the first time, on Aug. 27, 2016, Kaepernick, who was competing with Blaine Gabbert for the 49ers’ starting quarterback position at the time, explained why he refused to stand during the anthem.Kaepernick made it clear that he knew what he was doing and the NFL star said he planned to continue protesting – even if that meant jeopardizing his football career.""This is not something that I am going to run by anybody,"" he said. ""I am not looking for approval. I have to stand up for people that are oppressed...If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right."""
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/06/gun-control-measures-proposed-by-trump-lawmakers-after-florida-school-shooting.html","Two weeks after a gunman walked into a high school in Parkland, Florida, and killed 17 students and faculty members, survivors aren't giving up their fight for stronger gun control efforts.Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School teenagers have moved front and center in the gun control debate, organizing a coming national school walkout, meeting with President Donald Trump, lobbying state lawmakers and participating in protests.Since the Feb. 14 shooting, several ideas have been floated by the White House, Republicans, Democrats and state officials to combat gun violence. Trump also hosted a group of bipartisan lawmakers at the White House to discuss reform.On Twitter, Trump promoted the idea of having “highly trained, gun adept” teachers and coaches in schools who could confront a shooter before first responders arrived or serve as a “deterrent to the cowards that do this.”“If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!” Trump tweeted.Two school districts near Dayton, Ohio, already train a group of select teachers and faculty members to confront an active shooter. These staff members, whose identities are not revealed, have access to safes throughout the schools which have guns hidden inside.Ohio offers funding for schools to train staff to respond in emergency situations. There are more than a dozen other states across the country with school districts that have teachers or staff members who are trained to fire back, or which legally allow adults with guns on school grounds.Gun control advocates point to what they see as “loopholes” in the current system that could allow for people to purchase guns even when they legally should not be able to do so.Specifically, Jonas Oransky, deputy legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that advocates for stronger gun control, noted the ability for consumers to purchase guns from a private seller without completing a background check.He also pointed to the so-called “Charleston loophole,” which allows dealers to sell guns to a customer before a background check is completed – when National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) marks a document “delayed” but does not approve or deny it within three business days. He said a disproportionate number of buyers who obtain a gun before a background check is completed are domestic abusers, citing complex records and restraining orders that investigators need additional time to read through or discuss with the appropriate local law enforcement agency.However, Second Amendment advocates argue the background check system already does too much.“We don’t think it’s proper for people to have to prove their innocence to the government in order to exercise their God-given right,” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, a Virginia-based gun rights nonprofit, told Fox News.Attorney General Jeff Sessions said top officials in the Justice Department believe they can ban bump stocks through the regulatory process. However, gun manufacturers and owners are likely to sue if they are banned without any legislation from Congress.Bump stocks were approved in 2010 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives after concluding the devices did not turn guns into machine guns, which are prohibited under the National Firearms Act.The devices weren’t used in the Parkland shooting, but the massacre did reignite the debate over whether they should be banned.""I have traditionally not supported looking at magazine clip size and after this and some of the details I have learned about it, I am reconsidering that position,"" Rubio said during a recent town hall. ""While it may not prevent an attack, it may save lives in an attack ... So we'll have to get into that debate, but that is something I believe that we can reach a compromise [on] in this country, and that I'm willing to reconsider.""The suspected gunman had to stop to reload his firearm during the massacre, which Rubio added was “evidence in this case that it saved the lives of some people.” Several measures introduced in states across the country – including in Colorado, Illinois and Rhode Island – would ban high-capacity magazines.“There’s nothing more important than protecting our children,” Trump said. National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch has already said the powerful gun lobby does not support raising the age limit to purchase certain firearms. After Trump’s White House meeting, she told Fox News it was “good TV,” but some of the proposals were “really bad policy.”However, some Republican senators, including Rubio and Pat Roberts of Kansas, have voiced support for raising the minimum age to purchase certain types of firearms.“Certainly, nobody under 21 should have an AR-15,"" Roberts said.Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, announced this week that it would stop selling firearms and ammunition to anyone under the age of 21.According to a Harvard CAPS-Harris survey, 61 percent of respondents support banning the AR-15 firearm, used in many of the recent mass shootings in the U.S., including Parkland. Just 39 percent of respondents said adults who pass a background check should be allowed to purchase the firearm.Dick’s Sporting Goods announced in February that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and prohibit anyone under the age of 21 from purchasing a firearm.“We support and respect the Second Amendment, and we recognize and appreciate that the vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens,” Edward W. Stack, chairman and CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods, said in a statement. “But we have to help solve the problem that’s in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic that’s taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America – our kids.”Stack also said the company would stop selling high-capacity magazines and will continue its policy of not selling bump stocks.“Some will say these steps can’t guarantee tragedies like Parkland will never happen again. They may be correct – but if common sense reform is enacted and even one life is saved, it will have been worth it,” Stack said.“I’m a fan of the NRA,” Trump said. “There’s no bigger fan. I'm a big fan of the NRA. These are great people, these great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn't mean we have to agree on everything.”Several companies have cut ties with the NRA since the Parkland school shooting. Among them are: Avis Budget Group, Enterprise Holdings, MetLife, United and Delta.Georgia lawmakers voted to yank a tax break for Atlanta-based Delta on March 1 after the airline severed ties with the NRA.The bill cleared the state House with an overwhelming 135-24 vote, after being approved in the state Senate on a 44-10 vote. It was then sent to the governor's desk.The final version dropped an earlier amendment that would have renewed a jet fuel tax exemption worth $50 million that was taken off the books in 2015.“Businesses have every legal right to make their own decisions, but the Republican majority in our state legislature also has every right to govern guided by our principles,” said Lieutenant Gov. Casey Cagle, who threatened to kill the airline tax break days prior to the vote.The threat prompted liberal governors nationwide to court the airline, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo who tweeted his support and encouraged Delta to move its headquarters north.“Now more than ever the NRA is showing just how out of step they are with the American people,” Cuomo said in a statement, calling the NRA's agenda “dangerous.”The NRA has fired back at companies like Delta – and at the lawmakers encouraging them – for allegedly not supporting the Second Amendment.“Ultimately, our members are passionate #2A supporters. Having those on the left pushing for a boycott to pressure companies to drop discounts just shows how out of touch some are,” the NRA said on Twitter.Fox News’ Jennifer Earl, Matt Finn, Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

However, that order does not apply to first-time applicants.That process has so far yielded a number of proposals, all of which have failed to gain enough support in the Senate to pick up the 60 votes needed. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused Trump last month of trying to spike a deal when he rejected one of the bipartisan proposals as a ""total catastrophe.""“Why? Because it isn’t 100 percent of what the president wants on immigration? That’s not how our democracy works – you don’t get 100 percent of what you want in a democracy,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “Maybe in a dictatorship.”TRUMP'S DACA DEADLINE PASSES UNDER LEGAL CLOUD, WITH URGENCY DWINDLING IN CONGRESSAmong those rejected included a proposal from the White House that would include a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants as part of an immigration package that included $25 billion for a wall and other border enforcement measures and sharp cuts to legal immigration.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. said last week that members are moving forward with a plan that would address DACA and the president’s other priorities of building a southern border wall, ending so-called “chain migration” and changing a federal immigration program from a lottery to a merit-based system.“We are continuing to fix the DACA problem that was left on our doorstep when Barack Obama created a program that had no resolution,” Scalise said. “Now is the time to solve that problem. And we’re working to get that consensus.”Another shutdown looms on March 23, the deadline for Congress to pass another spending bill to keep the government running, where a DACA fix could form part of that negotiation as well.Fox News’ Joseph Weber and the Associated Press contributed to this report."

President Trump's family cares about the public lands and he cares about Utah and what we're thinking,"" he said.Under the plan, National Parks Highway that overlaps multiple roads connecting well-known parks would be renamed after Trump.

""I don't think people are going to be willing to drive on a road with his name on it,"" said Wendy Garvin, with the Utah Progressive Caucus.""No one values the splendor of Utah more than you do,"" Trump told the crowd during the announcement last year. ”And no one knows better how to use it.""The president said the sprawling national monuments were a “massive federal land grab” by the government under Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Both monuments were protected under the Antiquities Act.“These abuses of the Antiquities Act give enormous power to faraway bureaucrats at the expense of the people who actually live here, work here and make this place their home,"" Trump added.Native American tribes and environmentalists condemned Trump’s decision, claiming the monuments protected rich natural and archaeological resources.Republicans in the state, meanwhile, welcomed the move to shrink the monuments because it limited what can be done with the millions of acres they encompass.The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/06/cal-thomas-trump-boldly-wades-into-cutting-federal-government-down-to-size-will-it-work.html","Of all the promises candidate Donald Trump made during the 2016 presidential campaign, none will be more difficult to fulfill than cutting the size and cost of the federal government. That’s because Congress, which must decide whether to keep a federal agency, has the final word in such matters and spending – especially spending in one’s home state or district – is what keeps so many of them in office. Who doubts that self-preservation is the primary objective of most members of Congress?Ronald Reagan made similar promises about reducing the size of the bloated federal government, but was unable to fulfill them because of congressional intransigence. Perhaps his most notable failure was attempting to eliminate the Department of Education, an unnecessary Cabinet-level agency created by Jimmy Carter, reportedly as the fulfillment of a campaign promise to the National Education Association (NEA), the largest labor union in the United States, which backed him in the 1976 and 1980 elections. This pithy statement by Reagan got to the heart of the issue: “No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. Government programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we’ll ever see on this earth!”President Trump has asked every federal agency to submit a reorganization plan to the White House. Some programs, like the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) Biological Survey Unit (BSU), are decades old. The BSU was established in 1885, and among its tasks is the preservation of the whooping crane. Last I checked those birds seemed to be doing OK, but why is this, along with so many other things, a responsibility of the federal government?What’s needed is a strategy that shames Congress, which sometimes seems beyond shame, for misspending the people’s money. What will help in that shaming is for the president to establish an independent commission made up of retired Republicans, Democrats and average citizens. This commission would conduct a top-to-bottom audit of the federal government and present its findings to Congress, while simultaneously releasing them to the public, which would then apply pressure on Congress to adopt them.“Without authorization,” notes Schatz, “the feds spent $19.6 million annually on the International Fund for Ireland. Sounds like a noble cause, but the money went for projects like pony-trekking centers and golf videos.“Congressional budget-cutters spared the $440,000 spent annually to have attendants push buttons on the fully automated Capitol Hill elevators used by representatives and senators.“Last year, the National Endowment for the Humanities spent $4.2 million to conduct a nebulous ‘National Conversation on Pluralism and Identity.’ Obviously, talk radio wasn’t considered good enough.“The Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency channeled some $11 million to psychics who might provide special insights about various foreign threats. This was the disappointing ‘Stargate’ program.”The list goes on and on. Go to cagw.org, read all about it and remember it’s our money paying for these boondoggles (definition: “a project funded by the federal government out of political favoritism that is of no real value to the community or the nation”) that helps keep our free-spending career politicians in office where they get benefits the rest of us can only dream about.Yes, entitlements are the main drivers of debt and they, too, need reform. But starting with programs most people would find outrageous and worthy of elimination is a good way to build confidence and make the tackling of entitlements more palatable."

In one instance, a whistleblower called out a dinning set order worth $31,000. It easily exceeded a $5,000 limit on such purchases.Carson cancelled the order. The agency announced it is working to rescind the order.Another issue involves Ben Carson Jr., the secretary’s son and a businessman, who was invited by the secretary to attend a Baltimore “listening tour” last summer, despite ethical concerns from the department lawyers.“I don’t have any problem with ethics,” Carson told the Times. “Here is a rather unique situation, [Ben Carson Jr.] is somebody who is integrally important to me, and wants to help. I’m not going to just say no because it looks this way or that way.”The secretary claims the criticisms are only a distraction from his grand vision of the agency as a way to help the working poor in the country, something he believes the agency has not been doing for a long time."

Indeed, photos of other presidential phone calls depict Obama leaning on his desk, with his feet on the floor.”The relationship was further strained during the Obama administration’s decision to move forward with the Iran nuclear deal. Netanyahu and Obama also were at odds towards the end of the Obama administration—when the U.S. allowed for the passage of a resolution condemning Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank.On Monday, Trump noted his intent to attend the opening of the embassy at the newly-recognized capital in mid-May. “Israel is very special to me—special country, special people, and I look forward to being there.”“What better to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians,” Trump said, noting the embassy move gives “a real opportunity for peace.” “We’ll see how it works out. The Palestinians are wanting to come back to the table. Very badly.”Trump added: “If they don’t, you don’t have peace. And that’s a possibility also.”Netanyahu praised Trump's “leadership and friendship,” noting that “under your leadership, [U.S.-Israeli relations] have never been stronger.”Neither addressed the swirling corruption scandal engulfing Netanyahu's administration, or the ongoing Russia probe that has hindered Trump's time in the White House."

But unexpectedly, upstart far-right leader Matteo Salvini and his party got more votes than Berlusconi’s did. Berlusconi, though prevented by a tax-fraud conviction from holding political office, had been expected to be the kingmaker of a center-right coalition that in some polls was favored to run the country next.As Alberto Castelvecchi of LUISS University in Rome put it: “Berlusconi’s comeback was very strong in the media, in the TV, in the magazines, in the newspapers, but not so strong to beat the younger and much more vocal Matteo Salvini.”Salvini campaigned on “Italy First,” is eurosceptic and unabashedly anti-migration. The other day he said: “We are under attack—our culture, society, traditions and way of life are at risk.”“I think if they create a coalition among the populists, it would be fantastic,” he told a local newspaper, “It would terrify Brussels, pierce it in its heart.”But such a “dream team” probably won’t become a reality. Salvini said his “League” party won’t join forces with the other populist powerhouse, Five Star. But still, he believes Brussels is on edge.The incumbent Democrats took just 18 percent of votes.  They didn’t rate on the big issues of migration and economy even though Italy has returned to growth under their stewardship, and they have cracked down on illegal migration.And in terms of Russian interference—the jury is out on that loaded topic. But one common line of argument in Italy is that the Russians wouldn’t have needed to do a thing. Five Star was on its own web-based fast track trajectory. And Salvini is friends with President Vladimir Putin, never hiding his support for the Russian strongman.Berlusconi and Putin have always gotten along. Finally, Italy is not giving Russia much trouble. It is one of the most pro-Russian countries in Europe when it comes to desire to do business with Moscow.Now, the horse-trading begins. Someone is going to have to form a government. And they are going to need to convince Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella that they have what it takes to cobble together a grouping that can easily win majorities in Parliament."

And the result is that she got roughed up a bit as she decided to walk out the door.The New York Times said Hicks had testified that she sometimes told white lies for her boss. That, needless to say, is not a good look for a White House communications director.But Republican congressman Peter King told the Washington Post that Hicks, who said she never lied in the Russia investigation, was avoiding a Democratic “perjury trap” and “never lied about anything of substance—so that white lies could have meant saying Trump wasn’t available for a meeting when he actually was.Nor did she attempt to rebut an account that Trump had berated her about her testimony. Hicks was a buffer who knew how to absorb the inevitable presidential tirades, and colleagues would sometimes ask her to bring him bad news.Inevitably, she was involved in certain messes. Some questioned her initial role in defending Rob Porter, the staff secretary fired over abuse allegations from two ex-wives, because she had been dating him. And some questioned her role in explaining Donald Trump Jr.’s campaign meeting with the Russians—one of many subjects that must have come up in her interviews with Robert Mueller.Hicks didn’t seek to run the 40-person communications shop. She took the job on an acting basis after Anthony Scaramucci’s flameout and it later became permanent, giving a defined set of responsibilities to someone who had always had a wide-ranging portfolio.It’s true that the president may miss her presence, especially now that most of his original team—Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer, Dina Powell and many others—have left. But Trump still talks regularly to people like Reince and Corey, so Hicks could remain an important sounding board.I first met Hope Hicks, who had worked for Ivanka’s business, in the first week of the Trump candidacy, when she and Corey Lewandowski were pretty much the campaign. Many reporters got to know her even as she stayed firmly behind the scenes.Hicks had a major influence with few fingerprints. Last year, when the president began pausing virtually every day to talk to reporters, either at photo ops or getting on or off Air Force One, Hicks was a major proponent of that strategy. In the last two weeks of the general election, when just about everyone thought Trump would lose, a friend asked me if I would write about Hicks’ key role so there would at least be a public record of what she had done for the candidate.There was just one problem. Hope said no way."

Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!""That last word is just remarkable.How credible would it be if Sessions, a big Senate supporter and surrogate of the Trump campaign, who's recused himself from the Russia probe, was overseeing an investigation of how the Obama DOJ handled a surveillance request against a Trump adviser who had contacts with Russia?That's why you have an independent inspector general. And that job is generally occupied by career prosecutors, like Michael Horowitz, who has worked in both Republican and Democratic administrations.Sessions was firm but restrained in a statement, saying, ""As long as I am attorney general, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and the Constitution.""Trump has privately bashed and tweet-trashed Sessions before, most notably when he was angry that Sessions had recused himself from the investigation now run by Robert Mueller. Things reached the point that Sessions handed in his resignation letter, which the president refused to accept.Just last week came this presidential tweet: ""Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren't they the subject of the investigation?"" Trump tweeted. ""Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!""Fox's Brit Hume said of the latest tweet that ""this is Trump at his worst. He is asking that the DOJ investigate itself. The inspector general, who has his own staff of lawyers and investigators, at least enjoys a measure of independence from the department. Trump still wants the AG to act his political goalie.""On the other side, Jerry Falwell Jr. tweeted that Sessions ""must be part of the Bush/Romney/McCain Republican Establishment. He probably supported @realDonaldTrump early in campaign to hide who he really is. Or he could just be a coward.""Is Trump trying to embarrass Sessions into quitting? He's not a big fan of Rod Rosenstein, who would become acting AG, and the No. 3, Rachel Brand, recently quit.

But the way they performed was really a disgrace.""That was the lead of the New York Times story. The Washington Post ran a piece saying ""here's what he’s done in the face of danger"": accepting five Vietnam draft deferments (one of them for bone spurs) and appearing spooked when a man charged the stage at a campaign rally.Others ran pieces on Trump critic Stephen Colbert mocking the president. USA Today’s headline: ""Late night: Trump's living in a 'fantasy world' for saying he’d have 'run in' to Fla. school.""The Chicago Tribune’s headline: ""Colbert to Trump: 'What are you going to do, run in there and stab them with your bone spurs?'""Did Trump open the door with his comments? Sure. But ultimately, who cares? It's a hypothetical. We don't hire presidents to risk their lives fighting crime.The far more important question (covered by some) is how hard he will push the Hill do act on his gun proposals.The president repeated his determination to ban bump stocks. He said again that the country needs ""very strong"" background checks (""If I see a sicko, I don’t want him having a gun"") and to reform mental institutions.Trump continues to talk about arming trained teachers and others in school, although the other day he indicated that would be up to the states, which would mean no federal action.But as some journalists pointed out, Trump did not mention his plan to raise the age limit on buying assault-style weapons like the AR-15 from 18 to 21. He said last week that the NRA would go along, but the group continues to oppose the idea. So is the president backing off?In disclosing that he had lunch with top NRA officials, Trump told the governors ""they're on our side."" But he also said, ""If they're not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while. That's OK."" (Sarah Sanders said yesterday her boss still supports raising age limits on some guns.)If Trump, a vocal defender of the Second Amendment, does go up against the NRA, that would show a different kind of courage than running into a building under siege by a gunman."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/27/scary-stuff-how-fabricators-attacked-miami-paper-after-school-shooting.html","I am not in favor of censorship.And it's amazing that I have to say that, but there it is.What I'm opposed to are the dissemination of fabrications, bogus conspiracy theories and fake propaganda accounts that cause damage to individuals, to groups and to our country.The temperature level has of course shot way up in the wake of the Florida school shooting. And now comes a dramatic case study from Miami.McClatchy has a chilling report on one of its papers, the Miami Herald—chilling, that is, if you care about the future of journalism.Such tweets are designed to discredit the reporter and the newspaper through old-fashioned lies.That wasn't all. The perpetrator also managed ""to create a phony Miami Herald story — in the high tension following the Parkland shooting — saying that a Miami-Dade middle school faced threats of 'potentially catastrophic events' on upcoming dates, indicating that a new mass shooting was in the offing.""After screenshots of the fictitious story were shared on Twitter and Snapchat, Monique Madan, the Herald reporter whose byline was slapped on the story, said: ""It looks super real. They use the same font that we use. It has our masthead. It has my byline. If I were't a journalist, I wouldn’t think twice about it.""And talk about real-world consequences. Of course parents, students and teachers at the middle school would be scared by such a story and blame the Herald for fomenting fear.As technology makes it easier to create fake tweets, fake stories, even fake videos, the potential grows for undermining those who try to cover real news.We've also seen stark evidence of this as the Russians, during and since the 2016 campaign, have used bots and bogus accounts to try to disrupt American politics, first to push Donald Trump’s candidacy and most recently to exploit divisions over the Florida shooting.On Sunday’s ""Media Buzz,"" I questioned why Facebook, Google, YouTube and other social media sites can't do a better job of cracking down on fakery and propaganda. They've all admitted shortcomings and promised to do better, but one reason is that they don't want to invest the substantial sums that it would take.YouTube has apologized for inadvertently promoting a video calling Florida shooting survivor David Hogg an ""actor."" A 51-year-old Idaho man with under 1,000 followers posted footage of Hogg being interviewed by local TV last year for having witnessed a confrontation at a California beach—the clear implication being that he’s an actor who wasn’t really at the Parkland high school.That video drew more than 200,000 views and hit No. 1 on YouTube before apologizing and deleting it for violating policies against bullying and harassment.Conspiratorial stuff will always find an audience. But in an age when bad actors can use technology to literally fabricate the news, journalism outlets—including social media companies that profit from journalism—have to be constantly on guard."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/22/ex-playboy-models-notes-on-alleged-trump-affair-written-decade-later.html","EXCLUSIVE: The centerpiece of a New Yorker story on Karen McDougal, who says she had an affair with Donald Trump, is scribbled notes kept by the former Playboy playmate.These notes, obtained by journalist Ronan Farrow, are presented as her personal reflections on the relationship –“later memorialized in an eight-page, handwritten document provided to the New Yorker.”Readers could easily get the impression, as many journalists have, that McDougal wrote these notes during what she describes as a consensual relationship that began in 2006. But that is not the case.The New Yorker does not dispute that McDougal's notes were written many years after the alleged relationship. Instead, the magazine attempted to tie them to McDougal's eventual deal with the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc. “The article does not present Karen McDougal’s written account as being made simultaneously with the events themselves,” a New Yorker spokesperson told me. “Rather, the article makes clear that the idea to sell her story to American Media Inc. first occurred in 2016. Furthermore, her written account is supported by additional sourcing and documentation referenced in the article.” The more recent creation of the notes doesn’t mean that McDougal isn’t telling the truth. The magazine’s view is that the timing has no material impact on her credibility.But the timing of the notes is revealing about how McDougal came to go public, as well as about the role of the National Enquirer.The McDougal passages were written on a notebook marketed by fashion designer Izak Zenou, whose name appears at the bottom of one of the pages. He got into the business of creating office supplies in 2016, and the notebook was not available for sale on Amazon until March 2016.The timing is significant.Farrow writes that “the interactions that McDougal outlines in the document share striking similarities with the stories of other women who claim to have had sexual relationships with Trump, or who have accused him of propositioning them for sex or sexually harassing them.”But in writing the notes in 2016 or 2017, the onetime Playmate of the Year did not foreshadow, by a decade, similar accusations by other women.  The notes say such things as: “I was into his intelligence + charm. Such a polite man. We talked for a couple of hours—then, it was ‘ON’! We got naked + had sex.”After the New Yorker story was published last week, a White House spokesperson said: “This is an old story that is just more fake news. The president says he never had a relationship with McDougal.”American Media’s CEO, David Pecker, has acknowledged his friendship with Trump. The New Yorker quotes former two former AMI executives on the record as saying that buying and killing stories was a common practice under Pecker.McDougal and her lawyer met with Dylan Howard, American Media’s chief content officer, to discuss a deal. McDougal told AMI that she had been offered more than $1 million for her story, and also that she was in discussions with ABC News.The Enquirer maintains that it didn’t publish McDougal’s allegations about Trump in 2016 because it couldn’t confirm them, and that she offered no documentation, texts, receipts or corroborating witnesses. She was even told to search her storage for old phones or other evidence.The supermarket tabloid also says she did not offer any handwritten notes, which suggests they hadn’t been written at the time.During the discussions McDougal appeared to change her view about going public with the alleged affair, saying, “I don’t want to be viewed as the next Monica Lewinsky.”That makes the timing of the Enquirer’s $150,000 deal with McDougal, in August 2016, all the more suspicious, especially given the paper’s pro-Trump coverage under Pecker. The contract, in addition to the limited life rights, called for her to appear on two AMI magazine covers and write a fitness column, but some of those goals have not been met.So the company paid her big bucks even after concluding she couldn’t substantiate the affair, while making sure she couldn’t tell the story elsewhere.McDougal’s contract with American Media included a non-disclosure agreement, and that may explain the vital role of the handwritten notes.The ex-Playmate spoke on the record to Farrow, but the piece says she declined to discuss details of her relationship with Trump “for fear of violating the agreement.”That obstacle, intentionally or not, was neatly circumvented by the handwritten notes.Farrow writes that he obtained the document from John Crawford, a friend of McDougal, and “she expressed surprise” that he had it but confirmed that the notes were in her handwriting.Yet later in the piece, it became apparent that they are more than just friends.Crawford told Farrow “that selling McDougal’s story was his idea, and that he first raised it when she was living with him, in 2016.” As they watched the presidential candidate on television, Crawford said he told McDougal that her past relationship with Trump “could be worth something about now.”In an interview with CNN, Farrow called McDougal’s notes “written testimony” and said they exist because “in the course of selling the story, a friend of hers who coaxed her into selling it said sit down and write every detail.”(Two months after McDougal signed the contract with American Media, Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to Stormy Daniels, a former porn star who had claimed in an interview years earlier that she had an affair with Trump in 2006. Since that transaction was accompanied by a non-disclosure agreement, the payment has been widely viewed as hush money. Cohen recently told the New York Times that he paid Daniels out of his pocket and was not reimbursed by Trump or his campaign.)American Media told the New Yorker in a letter last week that a post-election amendment to McDougal’s contract allows her to respond to legitimate press inquiries about Trump. An AMI executive has now asked New Yorker Editor David Remnick for a correction, saying he had an obligation to tell readers that McDougal’s notes were written at least 10 years after the alleged affair. The executive said the omission was intentionally misleading.Remnick, a widely respected journalist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author who is also an ardent critic of Trump, responded that his magazine stands by its story. He said the story made clear the long time lapse between the alleged affair and the effort to sell the story. Remnick also said the New Yorker had disclosed Crawford’s role and included AMI’s responses.Farrow has gained enormous journalistic credibility for his meticulous New Yorker exposes of sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein by numerous actresses and the movie mogul’s attempts to intimidate the press. His detailed reporting on McDougal and Trump fits that pattern.Still, some journalists reached the understandable conclusion that McDougal’s notes were composed back in 2006. Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen wrote this week that McDougal “handwrote a contemporaneous account of her alleged affair.”Time, in a common formulation, said that “a former Playboy model kept handwritten notes about an alleged nine-month affair with President Donald Trump that began in 2006.”The Week said that “McDougal's friend John Crawford supplied Farrow with McDougal's handwritten notes from the time, which detail the affair.”The reality is that at least a decade had passed before Karen McDougal wrote those notes, after her friend and roommate urged her to peddle her story for money. "
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/22/trumps-early-move-on-guns-could-bridge-partisan-gap.html","Donald Trump could be the president who pushes Congress to do something about gun control, even if those steps are modest.Perhaps only a Republican president—and one elected with the full backing of the NRA—would be positioned to take such steps.But rather than welcoming Trump's move in their direction, gun control advocates are initially dismissing his efforts as inadequate.Even after the school shooting in Newtown, even with Barack Obama and Joe Biden mounting a sustained push for some gun-control measures, Congress did nothing. There was no way the Republicans were going to give Obama even a minor concession on the issue.Then came last year's Las Vegas massacre, and an outcry over the shooter's use of bump stocks to boost the speed of his attack. But nothing happened.When the conservative, pro-Trump New York Post is running such banner headlines as ""MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE ACT"" and yesterday’s ""HOPE FOR GUN CONTROL""—with a photo of protesting Florida students--it's clear that the national mood is changing.Even Pat Robertson, the onetime GOP presidential candidate, said on his ""700 Club"": ""I am a gun owner. I have hunted. I have shot skeet,"" Robertson said. ""But for heaven's sakes, I don't think that the general population needs to have automatic weapons.""Trump has ordered the Justice Department to speed up an existing review and issue regulations banning bump stocks. He has also signaled he is open to arguments about tighter background checks and raising the age limit for purchases of such weapons as an AR-15 rifle, the one used in Parkland.This comes from a president who embraced the Second Amendment during the campaign and said of the group that backed him financially: ""To the NRA, I can proudly say I will never, ever let you down.""Of course, after yesterday's gut-wrenching session with students, teachers and parents who went through mass shootings, Trump also said that arming people in schools could be part of the solution--an approach favored by the NRA.A Quinnipiac poll out yesterday said that 97 percent (!) of Americans favor universal background checks for gun purchases. Some 66 percent favor stricter gun laws, and 67 percent favor a ban on assault weapons.There is a partisan divide, with only 34 percent of Republicans supporting stricter gun laws, but 43 percent back an assault weapons ban.Washington's paralysis on these issues speaks to more than the clout of the NRA. Many lawmakers are just afraid of alienating gun owners, who are passionate and highly motivated voters.Now it's true the NRA doesn't oppose some of these measures, such as regulating bump stocks (though it doesn't want legislative action on the matter).But Trump does have a Nixon-goes-to-China opportunity here. He could detoxify the issue for many Republicans, bringing enough along to join with liberal Democrats in passing modest legislation.It's just as possible that, like immigration, this issue will become embroiled in partisanship and the moment will pass.Trump has already remade the Republican Party in his image, drawing considerable criticism from those who don't like him or his policies. But what if, in the wake of the Florida tragedy, he moved the party toward a more centrist and popular position?"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/03/06/reformer-saudi-prince-first-trip-abroad/","Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) began his first trip outside the kingdom in his official capacity as future king this week, aiming to woo support from leaders in Egypt, the U.K., and the U.S. amid sweeping reforms he is implementing across his country.The Guardian reports:When he arrives in London on Wednesday, Prince Mohammed will be received as head-of-state-in-waiting, and will travel to Windsor Castle for a dinner with the Queen. As a senior member of Britain’s most important trading partner in the Middle East, he will also arrive with a twin agenda: as head of a lucrative trade mission, and as a leader looking for validation after a checkered debut year in foreign affairs.…Elsewhere, in diplomatic and regional circles, Prince Mohammed’s embrace of Donald Trump and his embattled son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been described as “a beginner’s mistake,” which has undermined efforts to counter Iran.The first stop of his tour was Egypt, where the prince arrived on Sunday and was greeted by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as he got off his plane.Al Jazeera reports:His visit comes a day after Egypt’s top court upheld a deal to transfer two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia. The agreement was first announced during a visit to Cairo in April 2016 by Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, during which he announced a multi-billion-dollar package of investments and soft loans for Egypt.Following the signing of the deal, widespread protests broke out across Egypt. Opponents of the agreement said it amounted to selling off Egypt’s sovereign powers and that it violated the constitution, which bars the surrender of any territory.Along with its allies the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait, Saudi Arabia has reportedly provided billions of dollars to support Sisi.The 32-year-old future Saudi king reportedly discussed trade, the ongoing conflict in Yemen—where a kingdom-led coalition has been combating Iranian-allied Houthis since 2015—and rival Iran with the Egyptian president.MBS is expected to travel to the U.K. next.According to the Week, the British are expected to roll out the red carpet for the crown prince, whose father has granted him free rein to implement some of the most sweeping reforms for Saudi that the conservative Muslim country has experienced in almost 40 years.Some of those changes include a crackdown on corruption that has swept in members of the royal family, and even clerics, as well as changes to what women are allowed to do.In the U.K., Crown Prince Salman is scheduled to meet with the queen for dinner at Windsor Castle before meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May.The Week reports:The talks are aimed at strengthening defense, security and economic ties between the U.K. and Saudi Arabia, but “given how little we know about him and how important our relations with Saudi Arabia are held to be, it is fair to say that breaths are being held on both sides,” the Times reports.Demonstrations are set to take place outside Downing Street, with campaigners calling on May to challenge Prince Mohammed on human rights abuses and to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia.U.S. President Trump has welcomed the reforms at the hands of the prospective king.MBS’s trip comes while U.S.-backed Saudi Arabia continues to be embroiled in the ongoing war in Yemen that has killed thousands, including many civilians, left millions in the grip of famine, and has cost the kingdom an estimated $8 billion.Saudi Arabia is expected to continue working with the United States to prevent Iran’s growing influence in the Middle East.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Bush official Karl Rove and House Speaker Paul Ryan are begging President Trump’s administration to water-down proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.During a press briefing on Tuesday, Ryan — an avid free-trader — said he opposed Trump’s proposed 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum, asking the White House to be “more targeted” on trade.Specifically, Ryan said the administration should be only going after China on trade, rather than imposing global tariffs on steel and aluminum.NEW: Speaker Paul Ryan, who has been critical on Pres.

[Emphasis added]On Fox Business, Rove echoed Ryan’s statements against Trump’s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, saying he had a “bad reaction” to the populist trade initiative. Rove, like Ryan, says Trump should be solely going after China..@KarlRove on tariffs: ""I've got a bad reaction to it. I thought the issue here was China and China's dumping of steel, so we're going to get at China by hurting our allies… This ought to be more narrowly targeted."" pic.twitter.com/EZ4jpn6Ymu— FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) March 6, 2018I thought the issue here was China and China’s dumping of steel, so we’re going to get at China by hurting our allies, neighbors, Mexico and Canada,” Rove said. “This ought to be more narrowly targeted. This ought to be focused on the abuse.” [Emphasis added]Ryan and Rove were two of the biggest Republican defenders and advocates for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, also supported by former President Obama, which Trump campaigned hard against and ultimately killed by executive action, saving millions of American jobs in the process.In November 2015, when Trump was already campaigning against TPP, Ryan continued defending the multinational free trade agreement which was expected to not only eliminate millions of U.S. working and middle-class jobs, but also drive down wages for remaining American workers.Ryan said at the time that TPP had “great potential.”In the same month that Ryan was continuing to promote TPP, Rove wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal where he railed against Trump for opposing the multinational free trade agreement.“Mr. Trump’s worst moment came when he attacked the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal,” Rove wrote, defending TPP.Ryan and Rove’s attacks on Trump’s tariffs are similar to those by the White House’s trade globalists, including adviser Gary Cohn, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and Defense Secretary James Mattis. As Breitbart News reported, the band of trade globalists desperately tried to stop Trump from proposing the aluminum and steel tariffs but failed.Meanwhile, one of Trump’s close economic nationalist allies in the White House, Peter Navarro, told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that “it’s going to be a great day for America” when Trump signs the new tariffs into law. Navarro also blasted the free trade absolutism of the Democratic and Republican establishment, multinational corporations, and mainstream media.“I think the record is clear on these free trade agreements,” Navarro said. “They always are done with promises for significant jobs for Americans and significant access to markets, and we always lose dramatically once the ink is signed.”Multinational free trade agreements have been responsible for massive manufacturing outsourcing and job loss over the last two decades. For example, the KORUS free trade agreement has displaced at least 60,000 American workers since its enactment in 2007.Meanwhile, since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect in the 1990s, at least one million net U.S. jobs have been lost because of the free trade deal. Between 2000 and 2014, there have been about five million manufacturing jobs lost across the country as trade deficits continue soaring.One former steel town in West Virginia lost 94 percent of its steel jobs because of NAFTA, with nearly 10,000 workers in the town being displaced from the steel industry. Since China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, there have been 3.2 million American jobs lost with 2.4 million of those jobs coming from the U.S. manufacturing sector.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/03/06/manning-trumps-tariffs-key-long-term-plan-revitalize-u-s-manufacturing/","Tariffs on aluminum and steel imports are key to revitalizing domestic manufacturing industries, said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, in a Monday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with co-hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.Combined with regulatory and tax reform for energy production, the implementation of tariffs on aluminum and steel imports will make America a lucrative option for manufacturing operations, said Manning.“In today’s world, as opposed to ten to twelve years ago, we have the potential to be the dominant energy producer in the world,” said Manning. “Between natural gas, coal, and oil, we have the potential of being the dominant — repeat, dominant — energy producer in the world. That means cheap energy [and] cheap electricity are real possibilities, as opposed to what Obama’s policy was, which was to drive up the cost of electricity. Electricity drives industry. So if you have inexpensive electricity [and] raw materials available — steel, aluminum, things that you build things with — and you have those available in supply and domestically created … and you have a road system, which we have, and you’re close to market, there’s no reason for anybody to build a factory anywhere but in the United States of America, at least to service the American economy. That’s one of the critical pieces of this.”America doubles or triples its share of global aluminum and steel production via Trump’s economic policies, said Manning.“The reward is, as opposed to producing 1.5 percent of the world’s steel, the United States creates a vibrant steel industry [and] a vibrant aluminum industry,” Manning stated. “Suddenly, we are able to produce 2.5 percent, 3 percent, 5 percent of [global] steel and aluminum. We’ll have a domestic supply, which makes it a more stable supply.”Pollak asked Manning why a resurgence in manufacturing had not occurred during the second Bush administration’s imposition of steel tariffs between 2002 and 2003. According to Manning, President Donald Trump is ushering in a more competitive economic environment than what was seen during the early years of the second Bush presidency.“We still had a punitive tax policy in place [in 2002 and 2003],” replied Manning. “We didn’t have a robust energy industry, so we were dependent on importing energy at extreme levels, and as a result, a lot of the component parts were not there to rebuild an industry like steel, which is heavily dependent on electricity, which is an intensive industry in terms of labor costs and the costs of building those factories. What we have now is a different environment because of the tax reform, which Paul Ryan was instrumental in getting.”Manning continued, “We now have a competitive tax environment because of President Trump’s aggressive dismantling of Obama’s regulations. We have a much more competitive regulatory environment, at least compared to five years ago. … We have a vision at the top of wanting not just a temporary fix, but to really create an environment where industries can thrive. [We are] identifying key industries like the steel [and] aluminum industries that have really dwindled over the last twenty years … as key components that need to be secure and need be growing within our country. We now have an economic plan that’s geared towards trying to allow those industries to build. President Bush was never committed to using [steel tariffs] as a means to cause more steel factories to grow. It was a political maneuver, as proved by the short-term nature of [the Bush-era tariffs]. This is not a political maneuver [by Donald Trump].”China avoided existing tariffs on aluminum imports via transshipping — a term used to describe the surreptitious movement of goods to hide their origins — its aluminum to America via Mexico, said Manning.Last week, Curtis Ellis, senior policy adviser for America First Policies, similarly pointed to Mexico’s use of transshipping in an interview with Mansour and Pollak on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight. “China has overproduced its steel [and] aluminum, and they have gamed the system again [by] stockpiling aluminum in the Mexican desert, transshipping it through Mexico and through Canada, taking advantage of the low tariff rates, thanks to NAFTA.”Manning pointed to a report from the Wall Street Journal detailing allegations of China’s use of transshipping to facilitate its dumping of aluminum and steel.“Let me just give you a simple thing that’s happened with aluminum. This was in the Wall Street Journal, hardly a newspaper that’s well-known for supporting protectionist policies or for increased tariffs. Here’s what the Wall Street Journal reported about nine months ago,” said Manning. “In Mexico, they found a massive storage facility which turned out to be owned by a major Chinese aluminum producer, where they had stored an incredible amount of aluminum that was just across the border that would be exported as if it was being exported from Mexico under NAFTA rather than from China directly. They did it that way so they could benefit from the lower NAFTA tariffs and to hide the amount of exported aluminum from China directly to the United States by funneling it through other countries so it appears as though China wasn’t cornering the market through a dumping policy. That’s what they did, and that’s what they’ve done with steel.”Unchanged, the status quo of aluminum and steel trade will eliminate America’s aluminum and steel industries and affiliated manufacturing, Manning said. “If we continue doing the same thing that we’ve been doing, we know the results. And the results will be, we won’t have a steel or aluminum industry. We know we won’t have a factory base if we keep doing the same thing.”“Globalists” are unconcerned with the plight of non-coastal Americans who do not work in the technology or finance industries, according to Manning. Trump’s policies will benefit those who “make stuff,” “grow things,” and “take things out of the ground,” he added.“[Degrading America’s manufacturing industries] is okay to people who believe in globalism because they believe that’s a more vibrant system where resources are allocated more effectively,” Manning said. “I would argue that they’re wrong because they’re not dealing with real-world situations, and it also has the impact of lowering average U.S. wages on the whole [because] a vast number of people don’t work on the coasts in tech or in finance. The vast majority of people have to work in places where they make stuff or they grow things or they take things out of the ground. And those things are the things we’ve exported and made illegal here in America by virtue of our environmental laws, our tax laws, and it makes more sense to do it elsewhere and to transfer the environmental risk elsewhere. We’ve basically hollowed out America in many respects, and by doing that, we’ve created a problem in our country, and Donald Trump was the answer to that problem, and the people who created it, they think it’s actually good that those things have occurred, and those people should just move to the city.”Asked by Pollak about increased costs of living for Americans via tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, Manning was dismissive. “For all those people worrying about price Armageddon, this is equivalent to about a penny-and-a-half on a six-pack of Coors,” Manning said. “It’s about $35-70 on a vehicle, on a car – increased cost due to the tariff.”Breitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).LISTEN:Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/06/catholic-church-reports-spike-in-demonic-activity-italy-requests-exorcists-have-tripled/","According to recent reports, the number of people in Italy calling on exorcists for assistance to fight demonic activity has tripled, reaching nearly a half million per year.In a recent interview, Sicilian exorcist Father Benigno Palilla told Vatican Radio that more and more Italians are engaging in occult activities, which often serve as a gateway to the demonic.About a quarter of Italy’s adult population regularly visits astrologers, psychics, and tarot card readers, according to the consumer organization Codacons. It is precisely these sorts of activities, Father Benigno Palilla said, that “open the door to the devil and to possession.”Citing experts in the field, Vatican Radio said that some half a million persons request assistance from exorcists each year in Italy. Although many of these face other sorts of psychological afflictions rather than suffering from demonic activity, nonetheless the diabolical phenomenon itself has been “rising sharply.”The Catholic Church in Sicily has just finished a four-day formation course aimed at preparing priests to deal with spiritual combat involving Satan. “We touch on the most burning issues: from Satanic cults to previously possessed persons who recount the story of their liberation,” said Father Palilla. The priest is a firm believer in ongoing priestly formation as a fundamental weapon in the fight against the Evil One.“A self-taught exorcist will certainly make mistakes,” he said. “It requires a period of apprenticeship, as happens in many other professions.”Seminary formation too often skips over important areas, such as how to deal with real cases of possession, the priest asserts.“We priests frequently don’t know how to address concrete cases that we are faced with,” he said. “In our preparation for the priesthood, these things are not covered, and consequently we don’t know how to evangelize properly. In reality, people possessed by demons are the ‘existential peripheries’ that Pope Francis is pushing us toward.”Next month the Regina Apostolorum University in Rome will host its annual course on exorcism and demonic activity, featuring Vatican officials, exorcists, psychologists, physicians and other experts as speakers.The university is a pioneer in such material, Vatican Radio notes, having been the first institution to offer such a program back in 2006. Now its annual courses are always full, drawing between 150 and 200 students, comprising priests, religious sisters, pastoral workers, teachers and doctors.According to the founder of the program, Father Pedro Barrajon, the exceptional interest in the course reflects a growing awareness of the activity of the devil in the world, and a concern on the part of bishops to have some of their priests specially trained for dealing for this reality.Father Barrajon told Breitbart News that years ago the devil was downplayed so much that few bothered even to speak of demonic activity. For a while, he said, it was typical to explain away even the many accounts of demonic possession in the gospel as well as the episodes of Jesus driving out demons, “attributing them to the ignorance of the age and a readiness to recur to supernatural causes to explain diseases like epilepsy or psychological disorders.”While that may be true in certain cases, Barrajon said, “it certainly doesn’t eliminate the clear references to the activity of the devil throughout the gospels,” something that “is generally recognized now by scholars.”“Jesus obviously believed in the devil,” he said.Follow Thomas D.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/06/donald-trump-vs-the-world-globalists-rise-up-against-trump-tariffs/","A growing force of free trade globalists are working inside and outside the White House to stop President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs, while White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is trying to promote them.“It’s Peter Navarro, Wilbur Ross, and President Trump against the world,” a source with close ties to the White House told Breitbart News.Cohn lost the battle against Navarro after Trump announced the tariffs in spite of his advice. But Cohn is determined not to lose the war, working to appeal to the president’s deal-making nature to reduce the impact of the tariffs.On Monday night, news leaked to Politico of Cohn’s effort to get corporate opponents of the president’s proposed tariffs a meeting with the president, frustrated that Trump was not listening to his advice.House Speaker Paul Ryan signaled concern about the tariffs in phone calls with the president but said the substance of the conversations will remain private.“We’ve had multiple conversations about this, he knows our view. Every now and then we’re just going to have a different approach as to how we tackle these problems, but it should be acknowledged there is a problem that needs to be addressed here,” Ryan said in a press conference on Tuesday.Ryan called for action “more surgical and more targeted,” than universal tariffs, pointing to the problem of countries like China “dumping” subsidized steel and aluminum on the American market.Another Washington opponent of the tariffs is former Bush budget director Josh Bolten — now a high-powered and well-paid lobbyist as CEO of Business Roundtable.Bolten has mobilized top CEOs who supported Trump’s tax cuts against his proposed trade measures.“Business Roundtable CEOs are making the case directly to President Trump and his trade and economic policy advisors,” a spokeswoman told FOX Business.Trump allies are astounded at how brazenly Cohn is working to undermine the president’s trade agenda since it was a big reason why he won the election.As the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, Cohn is well-sourced with high-powered business allies and knows how to wage war behind the scenes, using the media and the business community. Navarro and Ross have tried to counter critics by dismissing the hysterics on cable news.Outside Trump allies believe White House aides who were upset by the tariff announcement last week leaked suggestions that it was the result of an unstable president frustrated with media coverage of his son-in-law Jared Kushner.Cohn appears comfortable in the administration, despite rumors that he plans to leave after the successful push for tax cuts. Trump, however, has told advisers that Cohn will leave if the tariffs are enacted, according to Bloomberg News.A White House spokesperson declined a request for comment from Breitbart News.Trump supporters like economist Larry Kudlow are urging Cohn to stay and fight.“I have to tell you, personally, I am urging Gary Cohn to stay and fight for another day. He’s done a great job,” Kudlow told CNBC. Kudlow opposes the president’s positions on tariffs, but admits that Trump is determined to make changes on trade.Global leaders have also called to express their concerns about Trump’s proposed tariffs. A Downing Street spokesperson noted that Prime Minister Theresa May “raised our deep concern” about the proposed tariffs on Sunday. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Trump to discuss his concerns about trade.Despite the forces mobilizing against Trump, he remains resolute to move forward on tariffs.“We’re not backing down,” Trump told reporters on Monday.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

The suspect reportedly told officials that his wife left home at 9:30 PM on the 21st leaving behind all her personal belongings — including her cell phone, medication, and purse.Terry then said that his missing wife texted a friend saying, “Will u plz come pick me up. 911.” A second text reportedly read, “I’ll do anything. I need u plz.”But when police became involved, shocking photos of the woman’s dead body were discovered on the suspect’s phone.Police report that the woman “appeared to be deceased” in the photos and was seen naked and bloodied. The photos showed severe facial trauma and a gunshot wound to the abdomen, police said.Forensics experts noted that the floors in the couple’s home had been cleaned with bleach but the team still found some tiny blood spattering on a living room wall. However, the missing woman’s body has not yet been found.Several firearms were recovered from the home, and police pointed out that as a convicted felon, Terry is not allowed to own firearms.Records show that Terry was arrested in Colorado on suspicion of attempting to kill his wife, but the charges were dropped when Chrystal refused to press charges.Based on the evidence found by the forensics team and the photos on his cell phone, police charged Terry with a series of counts including second-degree murder.

Even if he was doing her wrong,” neighbor Jay Meltesen told KPTV.Court documents state that Javier placed the 911 call herself at 2 a.m. Saturday and told authorities she thought she fatally stabbed her boyfriend with a sword, KCPQ reported.Police say they found blood spattered on the walls and Lovell bleeding out in the bedroom. Lovell was rushed to a local hospital, where he remains in critical condition.Investigators report that they seized the samurai sword and several knives at the crime scene.Authorities arrested Javier and booked her on attempted murder charges at the Clark County Jail. She is being held on $350,000 bail and is due back in court March 13 for an arraignment hearing, the Columbian reported.Police say they suspect Javier’s motivation for stabbing Lovell was jealousy.“I was trying to kill him for cheating.

Executives at companies that use the metals to build their products, including automakers and other manufacturing companies, have expressed a desire to meet with Trump to head off the tariffs.Trump, however, is standing by his call for the tariffs. On Monday, the president said “we’re not backing down” on the plan to put a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum.Trump’s tariffs announcement last week was a major setback for Cohn, who Trump refers to as “globalist Gary” in private conversations. Cohn has fought tariff plans for months, combating administration officials such as trade adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross who think the U.S. must do more to protect its economy from predatory policies of foreign countries, particularly China.But those internal battles took on even more urgency and became more heated in recent weeks after the Commerce Department published the findings of its Section 232 investigations. Those probes found that foreign imports of steel and aluminum were such a burden on domestic producers of the metals that they are creating a threat to national security. It recommended a variety of trade sanctions to protect the ability of the U.S. to maintain domestic steel and aluminum production.Cohn no longer believes it is possible to stop the tariffs altogether, one person familiar with the matter told Breitbart News. Now efforts are aimed at narrowing the scope of the tariffs, focusing them more closely on “bad actors” such as China.Similar efforts are underway on Capitol Hill. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday that he would urge the president to adopt a “more surgical” approach to tariffs and to specifically address China and other abusers of global trade rules.Many conservatives and Republicans remain wedded to a very ideological view of global trade and have knee-jerk reactions to proposals to restrict trade or impose sanctions, even when those may be necessary for national security. Club for Growth, a conservative pro-free market group, has warned that tariffs will hurt the economy. Sen. Mike Lee, the Utah Republican, is pushing a bill to limit the president’s ability to impose tariffs.Republican presidential primary voters in 2015 rejected nearly a score of candidates who held pro-free trade views, favoring the economic nationalist policies advocated by Donald Trump. Proponents of the tariffs point out that failing to live up Trump’s promises on trade would hurt the Republican party in the midterm elections and possibly endanger Trump’s chances of being re-elected in 2020.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

It also outlaws private gun sales, with an exception for family members. It was originally introduced in response to the December 14, 2012, attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School but was defeated when Americans figured out the bill, if it had been law, would have done nothing to prevent the attack from occurring.Manchin’s bill would not have prevented the February 14, 2018, Florida school shooting from occurring either.Yet the Washington Times reports that Manchin wants Trump to use “his gun control bill as a base for how to address the issue of gun violence.”Manchin said Tuesday, “It’s a good base bill.

Davis (D-IL) is pushing legislation to place a 20 percent tax on guns and a 50 percent tax on ammunition.The legislation is titled the “Gun Violence Prevention and Safe Communities Act of 2018.”The act amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, so as to require a 20 percent tax on “pistols,” “revolvers,” “firearms (other than pistols and revolvers),” and “any lower frame or receiver for a firearm, whether for a semiautomatic pistol, rifle, or shotgun that is designed to accommodate interchangeable upper receivers.”The act places a 50 percent tax on ammunition “shells and cartridges.”These taxes will only apply to law-abiding citizens, just as similar taxes in Chicago and Seattle only raise the purchase price of firearms and ammunition for law-abiding citizens. Both Chicago and Seattle have a “violence tax” on the retail sale of guns and ammo, but criminals do not participate in the tax because they do not buy their guns at retail.This ultimately means that such taxes drive up the prices for the tools that law-abiding citizens need for self-defense, even to the point of making firearms cost-prohibitive for poorer residents.Rep. Davis’s act makes clear that no “department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States shall be subject to any tax imposed on the sale or transfer” of firearms and ammunition. In other words, law-abiding citizens will be taxed on the tools they need for self-defense but the taxpayer-funded security personnel guarding the political class will not have to pay the new taxes.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

As secretary of state, Clinton chose to use a private, non-secure server for government business.”Outside of the obvious security implications, another reason this is important comes down to the statement disgraced former-FBI Director James Comey made when he went out of his way to let Clinton off the hook during the 2016 presidential campaign.In July of 2016, Comey reassured us that, “With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked.” (emphasis added)But, as we now know, between May and June, Comey’s statement was also edited from a hack of Clinton’s server being “reasonably likely” to merely “possible.”“Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail account,” he said before clearing her of any legal wrongdoing.We also know that Strzok was responsible for the language in this statement that was downgraded from “grossly negligent” (a criminal offense) to “extremely careless.”If these Fox’s sources are correct — and an Inspector General’s report on the FBI’s handling of its investigation into Clinton’s server is expected to tell us soon either way — outside of Strzok’s possible malfeasance, what did Comey know when he assured us there was no “direct evidence” of a hack?

The regime has also denied that it is supplying arms and missile technology to Houthi rebels in Yemen and, despite evidence showing otherwise, that the ballistic missiles that were fired into Saudi Arabia from Yemen were not theirs.In December, Iran claimed that United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley “fabricated” her announcement that the charred remains of a short-range ballistic missile discovered in Yemen, which was prominently displayed behind her during her speech, originated in Iran.That same month, an independent panel to the U.N. Security Council declared, “Design characteristics and dimensions of the components inspected by the panel are consistent with those reported for the Iranian designed and manufactured Qiam-1 missile.”Last week, ahead of his trip to Iran this week, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian’s said at a news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that Iran’s ballistic missiles program “worries us enormously.” He reportedly added, “Having such tools is not uniquely defensive, given the distance they can reach.”In October, Iran said it has no need to increase the range of its ballistic missiles because they were already capable of reaching U.S. forces stationed in the region.Adelle Nazarian is a politics and national security reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/03/06/manning-death-steel-industry-leaves-u-s-vulnerable-blackmail-china/","Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, discussed America’s aluminum and steel industries in an interview Monday on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with co-hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak. Destruction of America’s aluminum and steel industries via Chinese commodity dumping would leave America “vulnerable to blackmail on key component parts” needed for the U.S. to have “a modern industrial economy,” Manning said.Once China controls the world’s steel production, explained Manning, “the risk is the cost when the Chinese decide, ‘We’re not going to sell you steel, and you can’t build stuff anymore because you’re a threat to our Chinese economy.’”Predatory pricing of aluminum and steel exports are part of a broader Chinese strategy to destroy America’s industrial capacity via increasing its dependence on China, said Manning.“The Chinese are engaged in war,” said Manning. “They make no bones about it that they’re engaged in war, and they’re using dumping and every other tool at their disposal to degrade our economy and our capacity to act independently. Our capacity to act independently is our greatest strength. We’ve been blessed with great natural resources [and] an economic system that’s designed to grow and create innovation. … Those blessings that we’ve received, they’re our strength [and] our power. The Chinese are attempting to make us dependent upon them or others by degrading various key industries of ours that are key to being able to defend ourselves downstream and to have an independent economy.”Continuance of America’s growing dependence on Chinese steel imports will leave America vulnerable to Chinese blackmail over the supply of an essential industrial commodity, said Manning. President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on steel imports would allow domestic steel manufacturers and interrelated industries to thrive, he added.“The risk is the cost when the Chinese decide, ‘We’re not going to sell you steel, and you can’t build stuff anymore because you’re a threat to our Chinese economy,'” said Manning. “That’s the risk. You make a small investment … to rebuild a domestic industry that’s been harmed by Chinese dumping and allow that industry to grow and thrive and create an environment where we aren’t vulnerable to blackmail on key component parts to having a modern industrial economy.”Protection of domestic aluminum and steel manufacturers from Chinese economic predation is a matter of national security, Manning said.“We have a real problem if you do not have steel [or] aluminum and you don’t have the capacity to domestically manufacture that,” said Manning. “You have a national security threat. The last people we need to be dependent upon to be able to produce airplanes and vehicles are the Chinese, who are engaged in asymmetrical war against our country. Until we come to grips with the fact that they’re playing for keeps and we’re playing like nothing’s happening, until we wake up to that, we’re going to face an untenable situation.”“Globalists” are mistaken in viewing increasing international economic interdependence as a growing bulwark against war, Manning warned.“For some people, it’s okay [to destroy America’s steelmaking industry] because in a globalist world, the way it works is: you allocate resources where it makes the most sense for those resources to be allocated,” said Manning. “So it’s okay for the United States not to have the capacity to have steel mills because we can always get it some somewhere else. It assumes a stable environment. It’s really very kind of dreamy to think that because we’re all interdependent economically, that we can never afford to go to war.

Bush-appointed Judge Titus, in a 30-page opinion, rejected similar arguments and dismissed the claims of Casa de Maryland, an illegal alien advocacy group based in the capital beltway.The crux of the difference in the rulings is that Titus admits the possibility that DACA itself is unconstitutional, as the nearly identical Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy was already found to be by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Fifth Circuit. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have both publicly supported the view that DACA is similarly illegal. That belief forms the basis of the Department of Homeland Security’s stated reasoning for ending DACA.Finding that DACA was amost certainly legal, the California and New York courts then referenced President Donald Trump’s campaign statements as evidence the decision was not made for permissible reasons. Titus did not accept this reasoning, writing, “As disheartening or inappropriate as the President’s occasionally disparaging remarks may be, they are not relevant to the larger issues governing the DACA rescission.”Titus also refuses to allow the use of Trump’s statements to sustain any of the constitutional challenges brought under the Fifth Amendment. Neither of the first two cases definitely reached the constitutional claims Titus ruled against because they found a sufficient likelihood of success on the APA claim.Judge Titus, however, despite reaffirming the principle under which Obama’s executive amnesty was rescinded, took the opportunity to make clear that he was unequivocally pro-amnesty, referring to the illegals covered by DACA repeatedly as “Dreamers,” disparaging the president throughout, and writing, for example:For over a decade at the start of the 21st century, Congress quarreled over policies regarding illegal aliens who entered the country as children, and who may have no memory or connection with their country of origin. Would the world’s beacon of freedom—a nation founded by immigrants—cast out an immigrant population that was likely brought here without choice and who likely now knows no other home? While “no” would seem to be the obvious answer, ordinary logic has eluded our Congress.Judge Titus ends his opinion with an unguarded political proclamation. “This Court does not like the outcome of this case, but is constrained by its constitutionally limited role to the result that it has reached,” he writes. “Hopefully, the Congress and the President will finally get their job done.”Department of Justice spokesman Devin O’Malley issued the following response to his department’s win:The Department of Justice has long maintained that DHS acted within its lawful authority in making the discretionary decision to wind down DACA in an orderly manner, and we welcome the good news today that the district court in Maryland strongly agrees.Today’s decision also highlights a serious problem with the disturbing growth in the use of nationwide injunctions, which causes the Maryland court’s correct judgment in favor of the government to be undermined by the overbroad injunctions that have been entered by courts in other states.Despite these hurdles, the Justice Department will continue to defend the promotion and enforcement of the rule of law, which is so vital to protecting a nation, its borders, and its citizens.The case is Casa de Maryland v.

The Chronicle notes that Farrell “was the lone supervisor to oppose putting Prop. N on the ballot in 2016, calling it a ‘slippery slope.’”When asked if ICE would potentially subpoena voter rolls to go after illegal immigrants in the city, an agency spokesman reportedly said, “no comment.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/the-full-nunberg-ex-trump-aide-defies-mueller-in-media-tirade/","Former Trump aide Sam Nunberg had a full day of media availability Monday after a grand jury working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller subpoened him.Nunberg gave a series of interviews claiming he would refuse to cooperate – leaving some, like FOX Business’s Charlie Gasparino, asking if he was “of sound mind.”The Washington, DC, grand jury empaneled by Mueller sent Nunberg, one of President Donald Trump’s earliest enlisted – and earliest dismissed – campaign aides, a detailed subpoena over the weekend.It requested his complete communications with the president himself, ex-Breitbart News Executive Chairman and Trump campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon, one-time campaign chairman Corey Lewandowski, Roger Stone, Carter Page, recently resigned White House Communications director Hope Hicks, and several other close Trump campaign confidants – as well as Nunberg’s presence in Washington on Friday to answer questions before the grand jury.Rather than quietly comply – as is the typical reaction to receiving a federal grand jury’s legally-binding summons – Nunberg leaked the substantive part of his subpoena to the Washington Post and embarking on a whirlwind media tour, proclaiming that he will not cooperate.“I think it would be funny if they arrested me,” Nunberg told MSNBC’s Katy Tur when asked if he feared contempt charges or arrest, adding later, “I think my lawyer’s gonna dump me” and “I’m not gonna go to jail.”“What they sent me was absolutely ridiculous,” Nunberg protested. “Should I spend 50 hours going over all my emails? … I’m not gonna cooperate when they want me to come into a grand jury for them to insinuate that Roger Stone was colluding with [Wikileaks’s] Julian Assange.”“Roger’s like family to me. I’m not gonna do it!” Nunberg continued. “What does Bob Mueller need to see my emails when I send Roger and Steve clips and we talk about how much we hate people.”Tur, meanwhile, repeatedly pressed Nunberg as to why, until he received his own subpoena, he was generally supportive of Mueller’s investigation. He denied anyone had pressured him, claiming he came to this decision only hours earlier.Just minutes after hanging up with Tur, Nunberg called into CNN, where he stayed on the line for successive interviews with Gloria Berger and Jake Tapper.A second MSNBC appearance came Monday night, in which Nunberg talked to Ari Melber about Hope Hicks being his rival Corey Lewandowski’s “paramour.”Nunberg was no less flip in print. “Let him arrest me. Mr. Mueller should understand I am not going in on Friday,” Nunberg told the Washington Post in a similarly unguarded interview, vowing to physically tear the subpoena up live on Bloomberg TV.The reaction across the media was one of near uniform shock at his open defiance. Some feared he was under the influence of alcohol or had become mentally unwell.In a Fox Business recap of the Nunberg saga, Charlie Gasparino claimed that, as an old acquaintance of Nunberg’s, he did not “want to be doing this story right now,” adding later that he did not feel it was his “professional obligation” as a reporter to “blow this guy up.”“When he told me this stuff, that he wanted to go public with it, that he wanted me to break it, I asked him three times whether he was sure and is he of sound mind to do this, because I didn’t think he was,” Gasparino related to Fox Business colleague Liz Claman. “He told me he was drinking. … I just watched him on MSNBC and CNN, and the man needs help.”“If you’re listening Sam, get help. What I just witnessed was a trainwreck and I feel bad for the guy,” Gasparino pleaded.Monday night when Nunberg chose to continue his TV interview marathon with a third CNN appearance with Erin Burnett, she claimed she could smell alcohol on his breath. Nunberg protested that he had not been drinking.Relations between Trump and Nunberg took a steep dive after the latter was fired over a decade-old racial slur on his Facebook page. Eventually, Trump sued Nunberg for millions over alleged campaign leaks.That suit settled “amicably” out of court, but the animosity towards Trump was still clearly evident in Nunberg’s Monday “meltdown.”“I’m not a fan of Donald Trump, as you well know,” he told Tur. “He treated Roger and me very badly, and he screwed us over during the campaign.”“He treated me like crap,” Nunberg echoed to Tapper. “I should not have been fired, Roger should not have been treated the way he was.”Nunberg found the Trump-Russia collusion narrative “the biggest joke” and was generally dismissive of Trump as a meaningful political mind. “Had he not won the primary, he probably would have endorsed Hillary Clinton,” he said to Tur.“I wanted Trump to lose. I didn’t care if he lost. I thought it would be funny,” Nunberg told Melber.“The Russians and Trump did not collude,” Nunberg told the Washington Post, mocking his former boss and saying, “Putin is too smart to collude with Donald Trump.”Later in his interview with Tur, however, he reversed course. “I think they may. I think that he may have done something during the election, but I don’t know for sure.”“Granted, Donald Trump caused this because he’s an idiot, because he decided to give an interview to Lester Holt the day after he fired James Comey and then he decided to have the Russians in the Oval Office,” Nunberg explained to CNN’s Tapper. “Who the hell advised him to allow those Russians in the Oval Office?”According to Nunberg, he has already flatly denied to special counsel’s office investigators both collusion and Trump taking policy positions to benefit his business. He claimed Mueller’s men asked him things like if he heard Russian being spoken at Trump campaign HQ.Others in the Trump administration did not escape Nunberg’s broadly aimed derision. “You know what? If Sarah Huckabee wants to start debasing me, she’s a joke,” he told Tapper of the president’s popular press secretary. “Okay fine yeah, she’s not attractive, she’s a fat slob.”At the conclusion of his media grand tour, Nunberg appeared to issue something of a recantation, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he was “going to end up cooperating” with the investigation.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/free-trade-great-idea-election-loser/","The Club for Growth came out against President Donald Trump’s proposed steel and aluminum tariffs on Monday. That much was expected.What was rather incredible was the Club’s reasoning: it claimed Trump’s tariffs would “help hand the election to the Democrats.”The reality is that free trade is almost a guaranteed election loser (and I say this as a long-standing free trader who is personally opposed to tariffs in most circumstances, including these).Since President Bill Clinton, who signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) into law in 1994, no candidate has won the presidency on a free trade platform.Al Gore, NAFTA’s most prominent early defender, lost to George W. Bush in 2000. President Bush imposed, then lifted steel tariffs, and went on to win re-election in 2004, defeating Senator John Kerry (D-MA), who had a wishy-washy record on free trade (as on most other issues).Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) opposed free trade agreements in Congress, and won the presidency in 2008 by running against free trade. His opponent, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), was in favor of free trade, as was the next Republican nominee, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who also lost to Obama.In his second term, Obama flip-flopped on trade, negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and trying to reach a free trade deal with the EU.Hillary Clinton was also a hypocrite on free trade, though in the opposite direction: The former Secretary of State called the TPP the “gold standard” in trade agreements, then ran against free trade deals under pressure from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the Democratic Party presidential primary in 2016. In the general election, Trump called himself a free trade supporter, but ran against existing agreements and promised to raise tariffs, as he is doing.The problem for free traders is not that their policies are unpopular, but that the benefits of free trade are dispersed across society, while the costs of free trade — in factory closures, for example, which are theoretically temporary — are concentrated. The social scientist Mancur Olson called this the “logic of collective action,” and it was evident in 2016, most notably in the remarkable Michigan Democratic primary, arguably the greatest polling upset of all time.Clinton led Sanders by 21.4% in the RealClearPolitics poll average before Election Day, but Sanders won by 1.5%. Exit polls of Michigan voters showed that majorities of both Democrats (56%) and Republicans (53%) opposed trade by wide margins — even though trade supports over a million jobs in Michigan. Sanders’s anti-trade message resonated with those voters — and many of them may have quietly crossed party lines to vote for Trump in the end.Free trade agreements offer great benefits to society as a whole. But they require citizens to place enormous trust in their government — trust that the risk to vulnerable industries will be offset by new investment, or social insurance.That trust is lacking today, for a variety of reasons — one of which is that our government has not done enough to help those who bore the brunt of previous free trade agreements, while our politicians have largely ignored them.Theoretically, it is possible that consumers might suffer from Trump’s proposed tariffs before Election Day, for two reasons. First, a tariff is a tax, and it will be paid by the same people who are otherwise enjoying Trump’s income tax cut. Second, U.S. firms could be forced to cut jobs, especially in a trade war.But those effects, if they happen, will likely take a while. As much as free traders like me might wish otherwise, protectionism wins at the polls.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Stating her remarks amounted to “tough love,” the secretary told the chiefs she has seen little evidence of their use of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) to develop education plans that best meet the needs of students.The CCSSO is one of the owners – along with the National Governors Association – of the Common Core State Standards.DeVos said the purpose of ESSA is to “prohibit federal control of education.”The law is the most recent version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), and one that replaced No Child Left Behind (NCLB). The ESEA was signed into law in 1965 by President Lyndon Johnson as part of his “War on Poverty” program.“Whatever the reasons, I see too many plans that only meet the bare minimum required by the law,” she continued. “Sure, they may pass muster around conference tables in Washington, but the bare minimum won’t pass muster around kitchen tables. And I’m not alone in this view.”DeVos has been a proponent of ESSA, and said the federal law “invites a different approach” that encourages states to use “flexibility” to meet the needs of their students.She chastised school chiefs of states with accountability plans “that were so complicated, schools would be accountable to no one.”“We must do better for parents,” the secretary insisted. “For students. For our country.”“[O]ur children deserve better than the 19th century assembly-line approach,” DeVos added. “Or the “NCLB” approach. Or the ‘RTTT’ [Race to the Top] approach. The ‘Washington knows best’ approach.”“[T[he imperative to do something shouldn’t have to come from Washington,” she said. “It shouldn’t have to come from your state capital. The imperative to do better comes from students. We are accountable to them!”While DeVos asserted ESSA offers states more freedom, the law still requires the federal education department to approve of state education plans and mandates annual testing.Many conservative education policy analysts and grassroots parents, who studied ESSA prior to its enactment, found that the federal law actually imposed the Obama-era Common Core standards on the entire country.Following approval of ESSA, American Principles Project senior fellow Emmett McGroarty wrote at The Pulse 2016, “Anti-Common Core activists tried for months to warn Congress that the new federal education bill … was a disaster that would cement, not overturn, the odious progressive-education philosophies of the Obama Administration.”“Now comes confirmation that the activists were dead on — and that Republican leadership, including Sen. Lamar Alexander, Rep. John Kline, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, carried out a cynical scheme to betray their constituents and give the Administration everything it wanted,” McGroarty continued, citing a Politico Pro interview with former Obama education secretary Arne Duncan.“[I]f you look at the substance of what is there … embedded in the law are the values that we’ve promoted and proposed forever,” Duncan said. “The core of our agenda from Day One, that’s all in there – early childhood, high standards [i.e., Common Core], not turning a blind eye when things are bad. For the first time in our nation’s history, that’s the letter of the law.”According to The Republic, some state school chiefs “pushed back” against DeVos’s “tough love” with complaints about federal education spending cuts:Speaking in the wake of the Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, Tony Smith, the Illinois state schools superintendent, said the Trump administration was cutting federal funding for education, including school safety.“All of the cuts that are proposed do make it more difficult to do some of the things that people here want more of,” Smith told reporters after he and his colleagues met with DeVos.Kirsten Baesler, the North Dakota education chief, agreed. “It certainly makes our job harder to keep our students safe when our resources are being cut back or eliminated,” she said.However, Kentucky Education Commissioner Stephen Pruitt reportedly noted inconsistency in DeVos’s grading of the state education plans.He said DeVos rejected a proposal from his plan regarding school evaluation, but kept the same one in the plan from Georgia.“There is a lot of inconsistency in how those reports have been done,” Pruitt said. “I had to move it out of mine, get my state board to agree to that, but it got approved in other places.”DeVos also told state school chiefs they needed to have an “open and honest conversation about what went wrong” in Parkland, Florida where a 19-year-old young man with multiple incidents of past aggressive behavior went on a high school shooting rampage that killed 17 people.“No student, no parent, no teacher should ever have to experience what many did at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School,” she said.“We must have an open and honest conversation about what went wrong, and what we must do now to ensure our children are safe at school,” the secretary continued. “I look forward to hearing your ideas and working with you. I know we may sometimes differ on what policy levers to pull, as there is no one-size-fits all approach for every state, or for every community. And there will be varying solutions. I hope we can always stay focused on individual students.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Dick Durbin (D-IL) says that a lack of amnesty for millions of illegal aliens is a “humanitarian crisis,” while black Americans continue to be overly unemployed in his home state of Illinois.In the Senate on Monday, Durbin said President Trump’s end to the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was a national disaster but did not mention the fact that his state’s unemployment rate for black Americans remains above the national average at nearly ten percent.The end of DACA is a humanitarian crisis in this country created by President Trump on September 5. The lives of Dreamers hang in the balance, and it’s up to Republicans who control Congress to decide what happens next. pic.twitter.com/GlV6AlVQek— Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) March 5, 2018“This humanitarian crisis in this country, and I call it that,” Durbin said. “Was created by President Trump on September 5th.” [Emphasis added]President Trump, in contrast to Durbin, has secured historic wage increases, job opportunities, and record-low unemployment for black Americans through his strict immigration enforcement initiative known as “Buy American, Hire American,” which has weeded many illegal aliens out of the U.S. workforce.The black unemployment sits at 6.8 percent nationwide, the lowest ever in history since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking black unemployment in 1972.In contrast, while Durbin pushes amnesty for illegal aliens, which would legalize more foreigners to compete for working-class jobs against black Americans, the unemployment rate for black Americans in Illinois is ten percent, well above the record-low national average.In February, Trump’s strict immigration enforcement measures secured 600 black Americans higher wages and jobs in Chicago, as Breitbart News reported. The black Americans working at a Chicago bakery called the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to notify them of all the illegal Mexican workers working at the bakery.Lynne Lane, a worker at the bakery, told the Chicago Sun-Times that the racial makeup of the bakery was once 90 percent Mexican and ten percent black Americans. Now, she says the bakery is made up of 90 percent black American workers.Unlike Durbin, black Americans are some of the most supportive citizens for seriously reducing legal immigration levels, understanding that it would lead to higher wages and less job competition in the U.S. labor market.As Breitbart News reported, when asked, “In your opinion, about how many legal immigrants should be admitted to the U.S. each year,” 48 percent of black Americans said they would like to see between one and 250,000 legal immigrants brought to the U.S. a year.Black Americans have been disproportionately impacted by mass immigration to the U.S., researchers say, as they were replaced by Hispanics in 2004 as the largest minority group in the country.Every year the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/while-daca-illegal-aliens-demand-amnesty-americans-demand-less-immigration/","While illegal aliens, the open borders lobby, and corporate interests are out demanding amnesty for millions of illegal aliens living across the United States, American citizens have repeatedly demanded less illegal and legal immigration to the U.S.Illegal aliens enrolled and eligible for the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program took to the streets on Monday to proclaim that they are entitled to an amnesty that would allow them to remain permanently in the U.S.Meanwhile, Americans in recent polling say they want less overall immigration to the country, not more. Currently, the U.S. admits more than one million legal immigrants every year, the vast majority of which are low-skilled and thus immediately begin competing for jobs against working and middle-class Americans.In the latest Harvard-Harris poll, 60 percent of Americans said they wanted the process known as “chain migration” ended for DACA illegal aliens, preventing the group of nearly 800,000 to 3.5 million illegal aliens from being able to inundate the U.S. with their foreign relatives.Chain migration is the process whereby newly naturalized citizens can currently bring their foreign relatives to the U.S. as legal immigrants. Chain migration has imported about 9.3 million foreign nationals to the U.S. since 2005. In that same time period, a total of 13.06 million foreign nationals have entered the U.S. through the legal immigration system, as every seven out of ten new arrivals come to the country for no other purpose than to reunify with foreign relatives.This makes chain migration the largest driver of immigration to the U.S. — making up more than 70 percent — with every two new immigrants bringing seven foreign relatives with them.Likewise, the Harvard-Harris poll found that an overwhelming majority of Americans support President Trump’s effort to reduce legal immigration by nearly half by ending chain migration and instead implementing a legal immigration system that is selective and chooses immigrants based on their merit, skills, and English proficiency.A majority of 84 percent of Americans said they support a merit-based legal immigration system over the current chain migration process. Swing-voters are some of the most supportive Americans of a merit-based legal immigration system, garnering nearly 90 percent support for the plan from voters who identify as “Independent.”Another 79 percent of Americans polled in the Harvard-Harris survey said they are opposed to open borders and that the U.S. needs “secure borders.” Seventy-one percent of black Americans and 72 percent of Hispanic Americans said they are opposed to open borders, favoring secure borders for the nation.The most revealing component of the poll is a portion that shows widespread support among Americans for Trump’s immigration plan that would cut legal immigration levels in half in exchange for allowing only illegal aliens enrolled in DACA — about 690,000 — to stay in the U.S. The results of the immigration reduction would likely be increased wages for American workers and a tightened labor market that would give more opportunity to young Americans graduating college, black Americans, and the white working class.The immigration reduction plan is supported by 63 percent of Americans, including nearly 60 percent support from swing voters and 57 percent of Americans who identify as liberals.As Breitbart News reported, Republican voters now say that reducing overall immigration to the U.S. is the second-biggest priority for them, marking it as more important than tax reform, destroying ISIS, and even repealing Obamacare.Poll of Republican Voters: Reducing Immigration More Important than Replacing Obamacare, Destroying ISIShttps://t.co/CD9WsH7zVw— John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) February 22, 2018The current big business-preferred, Washington-imposed cheap labor economic model of importing more than one million new legal immigrants every year to compete mostly for working and middle-class jobs against Americans has resulted in decades of stagnant and even decreased wages for U.S. workers:Median earnings of full-time, year-round workers, 15 years and older, 1960 to 2016.For instance, the massive importation of low-skilled foreign nationals to the U.S. has translated to a cheap-labor economy that has aided in keeping American men’s wages stagnant for at least 44 years, as Breitbart News reported. Median earnings for American men working full-time were actually lower in 2016 than they were in 2007.Meanwhile, the economic nationalist model has already resulted in history-making wage growth for American workers in the construction industry, the garment industry, for workers employed at small businesses, and for black Americans.In contrast, the tight labor market economy pursued by the Trump administration via strict immigration enforcement could result in even higher wages for Americans if the system known as “E-Verify” was mandated across the country for all U.S. employers.https://t.co/Ndcyj30XGw— John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) February 18, 2018John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

(Field and Stream is subsidiary of Dick’s.)  Watson’s suit, filed in the Circuit Court of Oregon for the County of Jackson, says a store employee refused the purchase and indicated, “He would not sell [Watson] any firearm, including rifles and shotguns, or ammunition for a firearm, because [Watson] is under 21 years old.”The employee referenced Dick’s recent policy shift, disallowing firearm sales to anyone under 21, and cited the policy as the reason for denying the sale.Watson’s suit alleges that Dick’s policy violates Oregon law against age-based discrimination for people 18 years and older in places of public accommodations. State law includes prohibitions against discrimination in stores that are open to the general public.Watson also filed a separate suit claiming a Walmart store in Josephine County, Oregon, discriminated against him by denying him a rifle sale “on or about March 3, 2018.” As with Dick’s, the Walmart employee at the gun counter allegedly told Watson that rifles and shotguns could not be sold to individuals under the age of 21. The employee indicated that ammunition for firearms could not be sold to anyone under 21 either.In both suits Watson alleges that the defendants, Dick’s and Walmart, not only discriminated but “advertised … unlawful discriminatory policies by issuing a press release, and other materials, stating that [the defendants] will no longer sell any firearms or ammunition to any person under the age of 21.”On February 28, 2018, Breitbart News reported Dick’s Sporting Goods’ announcement that they would no longer sell firearms to anyone under the age of 21.

Since DACA’s inception under Obama, more than 2,100 illegal aliens have been kicked off the program after it was revealed that they were either criminals or gang members.Also, as Breitbart News reported, only four percent of DACA illegal aliens have completed a college education, making the DACA population far less likely than the native American population to finish college with a degree.Another 25 percent of DACA illegal aliens, Breitbart News reported, are “functionally illiterate” in the English language, despite being touted by the open borders lobby as being highly-educated and highly-skilled.Most recently, a DACA illegal alien was arrested in Rochester, New York after allegedly threatening to shoot up a nearby high school, as Breitbart News reported.Likewise, in October 2017, a DACA illegal alien was arrested and charged with murdering a teenage girl in Greenville County, South Carolina. The illegal alien DACA recipient, Daniel De Jesus Rangel Sherrer, allegedly shot 18-year-old Diana Martinez-Gonzalez to death in a wooded area, according to police.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/mississippi-u-s-senator-thad-cochran-to-resign-april-1/","Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS) resigned from office on Monday, effective April 1. He has been in failing health for several months.“Longtime Republican Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told The Associated Press on Monday that he will resign April 1 because of health problems,” the wire service reported from Jackson, Mississippi late Monday afternoon:Cochran, who turned 80 in December, stayed home for a month last fall with urinary tract infections, returning to Washington in October to give Republicans the majority they needed to pass a budget plan.“I regret my health has become an ongoing challenge,” Cochran said in a statement. “I intend to fulfill my responsibilities and commitments to the people of Mississippi and the Senate, through the completion of the 2018 appropriations cycle, after which I will formally retire from the U.S. Senate.”Attention now turns to Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, who under state law has the authority to appoint a temporary replacement to serve in the U.S. Senate until a special election, when Missisippi voters can select a permanent replacement to fill out the remainder of Cochran’s term, which ends in January 2021. The full six year term will be up to the voters of Mississippi in November 2020.November 2018 may be the most likely time for that special election.Mississippi’s other U.S. Senator, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), is up for re-election to another full six year term in November of this year.Wicker faces Tea Party favorite, conservative State Senator Chris McDaniel in the June 5 Republican primary.McDaniel was defeated by Cochran in a Republican primary runoff in June 2014 by one percent of the vote in a race that Tea Party activists considered to be unfair and stolen.Breitbart has written extensively about Cochran’s failing health in recent months, an issue that was a topic of concern back in the 2014 election.Earlier in 2014, Breitbart reported on Cochran’s “unbelievable skill for having federally funded buildings named after him.”After his first wife died, Cochran married his longtime aide, Kay Webber, in 2015. Earlier, Breitbart News reported that Webber had “accompanied him to 42 countries on 33 taxpayer-funded trips.”Gov. Bryant is likely to come under intense pressure from conservatives and Tea Party activists in Mississippi to appoint McDaniel to the seat many believe was stolen from him in 2014.***Update***For Immediate Release
Date: March 5, 2018Senator Chris McDaniel’s Statement on Senator Thad Cochran’s Retirement“I wish Senator Cochran nothing but the best in his retirement and thank him for his service to Mississippi in the United States Senate.Given Senator Cochran’s retirement, I will continue to monitor developments regarding his replacement and the Special Election that will follow.What is important is that Mississippi now has the unique opportunity to send two conservatives to the US Senate to help President Trump get his ‘Make America Great Again’ agenda passed. If Mississippi won’t send conservatives to the United States Senate, who will?While it is certain that Mississippi will have two US Senate races this year, I am currently focused on my campaign against Roger Wicker, but all options remain on the table as we determine the best way to ensure that Mississippi elects conservatives to the United States Senate.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

In addition, the U.S. mid-term Congressional elections and provincial elections in Canada loom. “All these complicate our work,” he said.The final days of the negotiations were drawn into the orbit of the recent announcement by President Trump that the U.S. would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Canada is the largest exporter of aluminum and steel to the U.S. Nearly 90 percent of Canadian steel production is exported to the U.S. Top trump trade adviser Peter Navarro has said that Canada and Mexico would not be exempted from the tariffs.Representatives from Canada and Mexico have both decried the tariffs. Canada’s top trade official has described the tariff as “unacceptable.”President Trump on Monday appeared to offer a concession on steel and aluminum as an additional incentive to Canada and Mexico to reach a deal on Nafta. Speaking to the press during an Oval Office meeting, Trump said that exceptions to the tariffs could be included in a new NAFTA deal.Lighthizer said that the U.S. may be willing to do separate bilateral agreements with Canada and Mexico if the three-nation talks fail.

He called on Congress to find a solution for the DACA population, many of whom are now adults. The move gave Congress six months to come to a deal and pass legislation on the issue. Trump later issued four pillars that he wanted to see Congress include in a DACA deal and declared he would sign such a bill.Sanders recalled the events for reporters and chastised Congress for failing to act on “legislation and principles that the majority of members of Congress have supported in the past.”“They claim to want to fix DACA. The President laid out a pathway and an exact way to do that. They failed to address it,” she continued, while expressing hope from the White House that Congress will “actually do their jobs, show up, and get something done and fix this problem, not kick it down the road and not continue to ignore it.”DACA challenges continue to move through the court system. Sanders responded to a question as to what happens when the case gets to the Supreme Court: “We fully expect to win on an appeal, and if we need to go to the Supreme Court, we feel very confident there as well, but again, it’s Congress’s job to pass laws.”“The sad part is that both Republicans and Democrats don’t disagree on most of the merits of this legislation,” said Sanders, who then called Congress “pathetic” and accused them of using the court system as an excuse as they have failed to pass legislation.“The fact that they can’t actually come together and get something done is pathetic, and now they’re using the courts as an excuse,” she said. “They need to come to work and actually do what they were elected to do.”As February came to a close, the Supreme Court announced that it would not grant a Department of Justice request to expedite the DACA case, skipping the liberal U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that is dealing with the case now.White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah shot back at the decision, calling the DACA program “clearly unlawful.” He added, “The district judge’s decision to unilaterally re-impose a program that Congress had explicitly and repeatedly rejected is a usurpation of legislative authority.” He then reaffirmed the White House belief that they would ultimately prevail.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/daca-illegal-aliens-wont-get-special-prioritization-as-deadline-for-obamas-amnesty-remains-meaningless/","The nearly 800,0o0 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program will not receive special “prioritization” to have their status renewed, as the original March 5 deadline for the program remains meaningless.In September 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA — which shields young illegal aliens from deportation — would end on March 5. However, since then, a California judge claimed the decision to end DACA violated regulatory procedures because it quickly ended amnesty for the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.Since the ruling, the federal government has now had to renew DACA amnesty for illegal aliens who apply for renewal. This renewing of DACA will continue until the Supreme Court makes its decision in a few months.While DACA illegal aliens can keep renewing their amnesty status, they will not be prioritized, according to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).“There is not a prioritization,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Press Secretary Tyler Houlton told Politico. “USCIS is processing applications as they are submitted.”As DACA illegal aliens can remain in the U.S. for the time being, escaping deportation once again, the pro-mass immigration billionaire GOP megadonors the Koch brothers have started a campaign to demand the Republican-controlled Congress and President Trump sign off on an amnesty for millions of illegal aliens.Spokesperson for the Koch brothers says its crucial to continue inflow of admitting more than one million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants every year: ""We just need to know there’s going to be no reduction to legal immigration."" https://t.co/411hsTDvUk— John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) March 2, 2018The Koch brothers have begun running this six-figure ad campaign for amnesty, in which DACA illegal aliens are described as “patriots” to the U.S.“We love our country, our way of life, and we sacrifice and fight to defend it,” the ad begins, narrated by the voice of a DACA illegal alien. “We work hard, put food on the table, care for our families, and we pledge allegiance to this flag. We are patriots. We are DREAMers. We believe America’s best days are yet to come. And we want to be a part of it.” [Emphasis added]The Koch brothers’ DACA amnesty push comes after the billionaire, avid free trade, low-wage-seeking, open borders defenders announced that they would oppose Trump’s popular pro-American immigration agenda that seeks to reduce legal immigration levels to raise the wages and quality of life of America’s working and middle class.“We just need to know there’s going to be no reduction to legal immigration,” a spokesperson for the Koch brothers said.The Koch brothers and their pro-mass immigration, corporatist views are deeply out-of-line with the American people, especially the country’s working and middle class, who have been hit the hardest by the importation of more than a million low-skilled legal immigrants a year.For example, as Breitbart News reported, Republican voters — even those who did not vote for Trump’s economic nationalist agenda — said they see reducing legal immigration levels as the second biggest priority, more important than destroying the Islamic State (ISIS), repealing Obamacare, and tax reform.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/soaring-american-oil-production-will-push-u-s-close-to-energy-independence/","American oil production will soar over the next five years, supplying much of the world’s growing demand for oil, the International Energy Agency said on Monday.U.S. production of crude oil, condensates, and natural gas liquids will rise to 17 million barrels a day by 2023, up from 13.2 million in 2017, according to IAE’s forecast. As a result, U.S. production will supply around 80 percent of the increased global supply of oil, which the IAE sees rising 6.4 million barrels per day to 107 million barrels a day.Demand for oil will rise by 6.9 million barrels a day to 1.04.7 million, the IEA forecast.The rising U.S. production means the U.S. will become close to being energy self-sufficient, a huge shift from the era not so long ago when the U.S. was the world’s largest oil importer.“The United States is set to put its stamp on global oil markets for the next five years,” Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said in a statement.The projections come from Oil 2018, the IEA’s five-year market analysis and forecast. The chart below shows where the IEA sees future oil production coming from. NGLs is short for Natural Gas Liquids, which is a family hydrocarbons that includes ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane. LTO, the largest growing segment, is short for Light Tight Oil, industry jargon for shale oil.“Over the next three years, gains from the United States alone will cover 80% of the world’s demand growth, with Canada, Brazil and Norway – all IEA family members – able to cover the rest,” the IAE said.The report notes that despite falling costs, additional investment will be needed to spur supply growth after 2020. That may be aided by recent tax cuts in the U.S., which dramatically lower the rates for corporations and allow for faster deductions for capital expenses.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

In a three-year partnership with the conservationists Lacoste will produce a a new range of polo shirts, each with a logo of a threatened species on it.Lacoste’s website states that “by buying a polo, you participate in helping IUCN and Lacoste in the fight for wildlife conservation worldwide.”In a symbolic gesture, Lacoste will produce just the number of polo shirts that corresponds to the remaining population sizes of the animals believed to be currently in the wild.The new “Save Our Species” line will feature a total of 1,775 polo shirts, with 350 shirts with a logo of the Sumatran Tiger, 67 of the Javan Rhino, 157 of the Kakapo parrot and 40 of the Burmese Roofed Turtle.Proceeds from the $195 shirts will reportedly be donated to the conservation union in an effort to help protect endangered species.The small green crocodile logo was designed in 1927 by the artist Robert Georg, with the original pencil sketch drawn in homage to the tennis champion René Lacoste, the winner of a series of international tournaments.The American press dubbed him the “crocodile,” following a bet with the captain of the French team. If Lacoste won a crucial game for the championship, he would be awarded a crocodile-skin suitcase. And Lacoste won.In 1933 René Lacoste’s clothing company was born, with André Gillier as founding President and a green crocodile embroidered on each shirt.In 2011, Lacoste removed its sponsorship from the Lacoste Elysée Prize, after the prize was awarded to Larissa Sansour for her photographic project “Nation Estate,” depicting a dystopic Palestine.Earlier that same year, Lacoste suffered another PR crisis when the French brand asked Norwegian police to prevent Anders Behring Breivik, a terrorist who killed 77 people in bomb and gun attacks in Norway, from wearing Lacoste clothing in court.Follow Thomas D.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2018/03/05/aipac-chief-opens-annual-conference-promoting-failed-two-state-solution/","Howard Kohr, executive director of the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC, launched his organization’s esteemed conference on Sunday by promoting the largely failed two-state solution.Kohr declared: “We must all work for that, toward that future, two states for two peoples: one Jewish with secure and defensible borders and one Palestinian with its own flag and its own future.”Kohr lamented that “today that dream seems remote. This is tragic. The absence of a constructive peace process is nothing to celebrate. Israel’s security cannot be fully assured and a promise cannot be fully realized until she is at peace with all her neighbors, and peace begins by talking.”Kohr stated: “The rulers of the Middle East are now beginning to see that working with Israel – instead of isolating her – can strengthen their own security and help them meet the needs of their people. These emerging relationships promise to be an example for other nations to follow, a force for moderation, and it is a message to the Palestinian leadership that a bright future is possible when you finally put aside generations of hatred and choose to live side-by-side in peace with the Jewish State of Israel.”Kohr was speaking at the AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, DC.The so-called two-state solution calls for the creation of a Palestinian state, ostensibly in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and some eastern sections of Jerusalem, in exchange for the Palestinian Authority ending its conflict with Israel and living at peace with the Jewish state.The “two-state solution” has been the defining formula for all Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, and so far every Israeli offer of a state has been rejected by the PA.Israel offered the Palestinians a state with territory in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem at Camp David in 2000, Taba in 2001, the Annapolis Conference in 2007, 2008 and during U.S.-brokered talks in 2013 and 2014. Israel has since been willing to restart talks at any time.According to some reports, Israel went so far as to offer the Palestinians control of the Temple Mount, Judaism’s holiest site, in at least two separate, desperate bids to make peace.In each of these cases, without any exception, the Palestinian Authority rejected Israel’s offer of a state and bolted the negotiations. In most cases, they countered statehood offers with major escalations in violence, including infamously launching the deadly Second Intifada, or terrorist war, in response to the Camp David peace talks.PA President Mahmoud Abbas currently refuses to come to the bargaining table. Besides the PA’s rejection of all previous statehood offers, a major issue blocking the “two-state solution” is that the PA, which would rule a future state, supports terrorism, incites against Israel, celebrates the killers of Jews and pays monthly stipends to those who murder Israelis. Abbas’s security forces have participated in scores of deadly attacks against Israelis. There have been ongoing attempts at reconciliation between Abbas’s Fatah Party and the Hamas terrorist organization.There is no significant evidence to suggest that a Palestinian state run by a Palestinian leadership that openly supports terrorism and has been flirting with a unity deal with Hamas would be moderate or a force against regional radicalism. There is overwhelming evidence to support the charge that a future Palestinian state would encourage terrorism, remain in a permanent state of war with Israel and work to destabilize the region.After years of failed negotiations and Israel’s disastrous evacuation of the Gaza Strip in 2005, which resulted in Hamas’s takeover of that territory, the Israeli public currently overwhelmingly rejects an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, according to numerous recent surveys.There have been attempts within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud Party to pass legislation calling for Israeli annexation of the strategic West Bank as an alternative to the “two-state solution.”The West Bank contains historic Jewish communities and some of the holiest sites in Judaism, including the Tomb of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in Hebron, Rachel’s Tomb in Bethlehem and Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus, or biblical Shechem. The mountainous territory straddles major central Israeli population centers and is a short drive from Israel’s international airport.The Palestinians never had a state in either the West Bank or eastern Jerusalem and they are not legally recognized as the authority in those areas.Meanwhile, some within the Israeli government took issue with AIPAC’s promotion of the two-state solution, including phraseology in the lobby’s website mission statement calling “the promotion of a negotiated two-state solution — a Jewish state of Israel and a demilitarized Palestinian state.”Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan wrote AIPAC to say the website “seems to imply that Israel is committed to a two-state solution and that the United States takes this position as well.”“Please note this assumption has no basis in fact,” he said.“I am astounded as to why such a great, meaningful organization as AIPAC, whose raison d’etre is pro-Israel advocacy in the United States, would represent the positions of the State of Israel (and of the United States) so inaccurately before senior government officials, senators and congressmen, and the general pro-Israel public,” Dagan wrote.“The position that AIPAC is representing as that of the State of Israel — in the AIPAC mission statement and in the AIPAC talking points inter alia — not only fails to represent Israel properly, it is detrimental to the efforts to achieve dialogue in the Middle East,” he added.The Jerusalem Post reported that Land of Israel Caucus co-chairs Likud MK Yoav Kisch and Bayit Yehudi MK Bezalel Smotrich informed AIPAC, “The two state proposal is opposed by the majority of the ministers of the Israeli government, most of the ruling government coalition and most importantly, by the broad spectrum of the citizens of Israel.”“Harsh lessons of the past regarding land concessions have demonstrated that creating the groundwork for a terrorist, fundamentalist, Muslim state in the heart of the Land of Israel is dangerous and lethal to the security of Israel.”Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

What the gangsters at CNN want is to silence the political right, to chill our speech, to remove us from the debate, to end our influence.And so, because CNN is losing in the open arena of ideas as its ratings bottom out, the anti-Trump cable channel has now decided to silence us using the protection racket — to intimidate our advertisers under the guise of journalism.The CNN story noted here is nothing less than extortion.CNN sent out a reporter to ask various companies why their ads are appearing on YouTube videos produced by Alex Jones and InfoWars. In other words, CNN is not only publicly shaming and outing these businesses, CNN is also threatening that this exposure will lead to astro-turfed harassment campaigns and boycotts.But like the smart gangsters they are, CNN also gives these proprietors a way out, a way to buy protection: drop this advertising and CNN will ensure your business is not burned to the ground.Biases up front — I am no Alex Jones fan. He has some talented people on the payroll, but if InfoWars was to go out of business organically, I would not be able to summon a damn. But I am also a free speech extremist who loves living in a country where Alex Jones is part of the public square.I would say, and have said the same, about anyone on the left. As long as you are not condoning or calling for violence, you should be allowed to say whatever you like on social media — this includes lies and conspiracy theories, because the idea of handing someone the power to decide what is and is not a lie or conspiracy theory is much more frightening than lies and conspiracy theories.There are many forms of free expression that I find toxic. But what is far worse than toxic freedom is oppression, what is far more immoral than toxic speech is silencing that speech.The only thing that should be used to fight free speech is more free speech, and those of us who do not want to hear that speech, or who feel harassed in some way, are all blessed with a block button.YouTube is part of our public square, as are Facebook and Twitter. And if you are banned from any of these speech platforms, you are no longer part of the public debate. Rather, you are in a dark room speaking to no one.This is why the social media crackdown against right-of-center speech is so alarming. After capturing the ways in which Americans communicate with one another, these tech oligarchs are now threatening to exclude us from their platforms if we do not behave, speak, and believe, in the appropriate ways.Like many, I believe a private company should be allowed to run its business however it likes. Social media, however, is different. Imagine if 50 years ago a private company purchased the U.S. mail and the telephone company — now imagine if they monitored and censored our communications based on their partisan speech codes. How is that any different from what corporate fascists in Silicon Valley are up to right now?And now, as a means to silence opinions the establishment doesn’t like, CNN is acting as the muscle, the enforcer, the thugs, the gangsters for these tech oligarchs … Running around and openly intimidating businesses; threatening them with extinction, and by extension, making an example of them to others.Today it is Alex Jones.Tomorrow it is Breitbart News.Wednesday it is you. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Hutchinson said that the work requirement is “not about punishing anyone.”“It’s about giving people the opportunity to work. It’s to give them training that they need. It’s to help them move out of poverty and up the economic ladder,” Hutchinson added.The governor was joined by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma.The Medicaid work requirements would only apply to able-bodied, working-age adults. Americans with disabilities, older Americans, children, and pregnant women would not have to comply with potential Medicaid work stipulations.Hutchinson also revealed that the waiver from the CMS does not include a reduction of “Medicaid coverage down to 100 percent of the federal poverty level.”“The administrator has agreed to continue to work with us on that, but we did not want to wait for a full analysis of the entire waiver,” Hutchinson explained.Gov. Hutchinson argued that his waiver would save roughly $365 million in the fiscal year 2019.President Donald Trump’s administration issued a guidance in January allowing states to apply for waivers to reform their state Medicaid programs.Verma, who worked with then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence to reform that state’s Medicaid program, said, “This gives us a pathway to start approving waivers. This is about helping those individuals rise out of poverty.”Kentucky became the first state to implement work requirements for Medicaid after the CMS approved its waiver in January. Indiana became the second state to implement its work requirements for Medicaid in February.A Rassmussen poll in January found that 64 percent of Americans approve of work requirements for Medicaid.Wisconsin Gov.

As secretary of state, Clinton chose to use a private, non-secure server for government business.”Outside of the obvious security implications, another reason this is important comes down to the statement disgraced former-FBI Director James Comey made when he went out of his way to let Clinton off the hook during the 2016 presidential campaign.In July of 2016, Comey reassured us that, “With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked.” (emphasis added)But, as we now know, between May and June, Comey’s statement was also edited from a hack of Clinton’s server being “reasonably likely” to merely “possible.”“Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail account,” he said before clearing her of any legal wrongdoing.We also know that Strzok was responsible for the language in this statement that was downgraded from “grossly negligent” (a criminal offense) to “extremely careless.”If these Fox’s sources are correct — and an Inspector General’s report on the FBI’s handling of its investigation into Clinton’s server is expected to tell us soon either way — outside of Strzok’s possible malfeasance, what did Comey know when he assured us there was no “direct evidence” of a hack?

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/the-full-nunberg-ex-trump-aide-defies-mueller-in-media-tirade/#disqus_thread","Former Trump aide Sam Nunberg had a full day of media availability Monday after a grand jury working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller subpoened him.Nunberg gave a series of interviews claiming he would refuse to cooperate – leaving some, like FOX Business’s Charlie Gasparino, asking if he was “of sound mind.”The Washington, DC, grand jury empaneled by Mueller sent Nunberg, one of President Donald Trump’s earliest enlisted – and earliest dismissed – campaign aides, a detailed subpoena over the weekend.It requested his complete communications with the president himself, ex-Breitbart News Executive Chairman and Trump campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon, one-time campaign chairman Corey Lewandowski, Roger Stone, Carter Page, recently resigned White House Communications director Hope Hicks, and several other close Trump campaign confidants – as well as Nunberg’s presence in Washington on Friday to answer questions before the grand jury.Rather than quietly comply – as is the typical reaction to receiving a federal grand jury’s legally-binding summons – Nunberg leaked the substantive part of his subpoena to the Washington Post and embarking on a whirlwind media tour, proclaiming that he will not cooperate.“I think it would be funny if they arrested me,” Nunberg told MSNBC’s Katy Tur when asked if he feared contempt charges or arrest, adding later, “I think my lawyer’s gonna dump me” and “I’m not gonna go to jail.”“What they sent me was absolutely ridiculous,” Nunberg protested. “Should I spend 50 hours going over all my emails? … I’m not gonna cooperate when they want me to come into a grand jury for them to insinuate that Roger Stone was colluding with [Wikileaks’s] Julian Assange.”“Roger’s like family to me. I’m not gonna do it!” Nunberg continued. “What does Bob Mueller need to see my emails when I send Roger and Steve clips and we talk about how much we hate people.”Tur, meanwhile, repeatedly pressed Nunberg as to why, until he received his own subpoena, he was generally supportive of Mueller’s investigation. He denied anyone had pressured him, claiming he came to this decision only hours earlier.Just minutes after hanging up with Tur, Nunberg called into CNN, where he stayed on the line for successive interviews with Gloria Berger and Jake Tapper.A second MSNBC appearance came Monday night, in which Nunberg talked to Ari Melber about Hope Hicks being his rival Corey Lewandowski’s “paramour.”Nunberg was no less flip in print. “Let him arrest me. Mr. Mueller should understand I am not going in on Friday,” Nunberg told the Washington Post in a similarly unguarded interview, vowing to physically tear the subpoena up live on Bloomberg TV.The reaction across the media was one of near uniform shock at his open defiance. Some feared he was under the influence of alcohol or had become mentally unwell.In a Fox Business recap of the Nunberg saga, Charlie Gasparino claimed that, as an old acquaintance of Nunberg’s, he did not “want to be doing this story right now,” adding later that he did not feel it was his “professional obligation” as a reporter to “blow this guy up.”“When he told me this stuff, that he wanted to go public with it, that he wanted me to break it, I asked him three times whether he was sure and is he of sound mind to do this, because I didn’t think he was,” Gasparino related to Fox Business colleague Liz Claman. “He told me he was drinking. … I just watched him on MSNBC and CNN, and the man needs help.”“If you’re listening Sam, get help. What I just witnessed was a trainwreck and I feel bad for the guy,” Gasparino pleaded.Monday night when Nunberg chose to continue his TV interview marathon with a third CNN appearance with Erin Burnett, she claimed she could smell alcohol on his breath. Nunberg protested that he had not been drinking.Relations between Trump and Nunberg took a steep dive after the latter was fired over a decade-old racial slur on his Facebook page. Eventually, Trump sued Nunberg for millions over alleged campaign leaks.That suit settled “amicably” out of court, but the animosity towards Trump was still clearly evident in Nunberg’s Monday “meltdown.”“I’m not a fan of Donald Trump, as you well know,” he told Tur. “He treated Roger and me very badly, and he screwed us over during the campaign.”“He treated me like crap,” Nunberg echoed to Tapper. “I should not have been fired, Roger should not have been treated the way he was.”Nunberg found the Trump-Russia collusion narrative “the biggest joke” and was generally dismissive of Trump as a meaningful political mind. “Had he not won the primary, he probably would have endorsed Hillary Clinton,” he said to Tur.“I wanted Trump to lose. I didn’t care if he lost. I thought it would be funny,” Nunberg told Melber.“The Russians and Trump did not collude,” Nunberg told the Washington Post, mocking his former boss and saying, “Putin is too smart to collude with Donald Trump.”Later in his interview with Tur, however, he reversed course. “I think they may. I think that he may have done something during the election, but I don’t know for sure.”“Granted, Donald Trump caused this because he’s an idiot, because he decided to give an interview to Lester Holt the day after he fired James Comey and then he decided to have the Russians in the Oval Office,” Nunberg explained to CNN’s Tapper. “Who the hell advised him to allow those Russians in the Oval Office?”According to Nunberg, he has already flatly denied to special counsel’s office investigators both collusion and Trump taking policy positions to benefit his business. He claimed Mueller’s men asked him things like if he heard Russian being spoken at Trump campaign HQ.Others in the Trump administration did not escape Nunberg’s broadly aimed derision. “You know what? If Sarah Huckabee wants to start debasing me, she’s a joke,” he told Tapper of the president’s popular press secretary. “Okay fine yeah, she’s not attractive, she’s a fat slob.”At the conclusion of his media grand tour, Nunberg appeared to issue something of a recantation, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he was “going to end up cooperating” with the investigation.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

You all have blood on your hands.— Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) February 14, 2018CNN’s February 21 gun control town hall highlighted the media’s animosity towards the NRA, as it featured survivors from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting confronting Republicans over NRA affiliation. The Guardian reported that one student spoke to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), asking, “Can you tell me right now you will not accept a single donation from the NRA?”In addition, more than a dozen companies severed ties with the NRA in the wake of the school attack, ending discounted rates and fares for NRA members.But a large swath of the American populace is equating these various attacks on the NRA with attacks on the Second Amendment, and others see the attacks as proof of “media bias.” The result is an explosion in NRA memberships.The Daily Mail quoted Cleta Mitchell, a former NRA board member and former Oklahoma lawmaker, who said, “There is no one. NO ONE. Who joins the NRA for a discount on a rental car. You can rest assured that the NRA will not lose a single member as a result of this. If anything, it should spur people to join the NRA as a means of demonstrating that we who believe in the Second Amendment will not be bullied by these left wing multi-billion dollar corporations.”AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/oregon-20-year-old-sues-dicks-sporting-goods-refusing-sell-rifle/#disqus_thread","A 20-year-old is suing Dick’s Sporting Goods after being refused a Ruger .22 rifle purchase based on his age.The plaintiff, Tyler Watson, claims he faced “Unlawful Age Discrimination.”Watson attempted to buy the rifle “on or about February 24” at a Medford, Oregon, Field and Stream store. (Field and Stream is subsidiary of Dick’s.)  Watson’s suit, filed in the Circuit Court of Oregon for the County of Jackson, says a store employee refused the purchase and indicated, “He would not sell [Watson] any firearm, including rifles and shotguns, or ammunition for a firearm, because [Watson] is under 21 years old.”The employee referenced Dick’s recent policy shift, disallowing firearm sales to anyone under 21, and cited the policy as the reason for denying the sale.Watson’s suit alleges that Dick’s policy violates Oregon law against age-based discrimination for people 18 years and older in places of public accommodations. State law includes prohibitions against discrimination in stores that are open to the general public.Watson also filed a separate suit claiming a Walmart store in Josephine County, Oregon, discriminated against him by denying him a rifle sale “on or about March 3, 2018.” As with Dick’s, the Walmart employee at the gun counter allegedly told Watson that rifles and shotguns could not be sold to individuals under the age of 21. The employee indicated that ammunition for firearms could not be sold to anyone under 21 either.In both suits Watson alleges that the defendants, Dick’s and Walmart, not only discriminated but “advertised … unlawful discriminatory policies by issuing a press release, and other materials, stating that [the defendants] will no longer sell any firearms or ammunition to any person under the age of 21.”On February 28, 2018, Breitbart News reported Dick’s Sporting Goods’ announcement that they would no longer sell firearms to anyone under the age of 21. That same day, Walmart announced that it would no longer sell guns to anyone under the age of 21.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.
