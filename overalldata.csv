"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/trump-netanyahu-jerusalem-embassy.html","WASHINGTON — In the midst of his campaign, President Trump vowed to bring peace to the Middle East by playing it down the middle between Israel and the Palestinians. “Let me be sort of a neutral guy,” he said. Two years later, any hopes of being the neutral guy are long gone.In a meeting at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel put on display perhaps the closest relationship between leaders of their two countries in the seven decades since Israel declared independence. As for the Palestinians, they are no longer on speaking terms with the president, who is busy cutting their aid.Few if any doubted that Mr. Trump came into office more supportive of Israel than the Palestinians and he trumpeted his pro-Israeli credentials, but any semblance of straddling the line between warring camps has vanished and the notion that he could bring them together appears more distant than ever. Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu lavished praise on each other on Monday, and the president said he might visit Jerusalem in May to preside over the politically potent transfer of the American Embassy to the disputed holy city.Mr. Trump insisted that he still had “a good chance” of forging peace and expressed optimism that the Palestinians were ready to return to discussions. “The Palestinians, I think, are wanting to come back to the table very badly,” he said, despite evidence to the contrary. Then he acknowledged what would happen if he is wrong. “If they don’t, you don’t have peace.”The White House has said it is close to finishing a peace plan that it could release soon. But the conditions hardly seem ripe. The two men who met in the Oval Office on Monday are both fighting off investigations. The president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was leading the effort for him, just lost his top-secret security clearance. And the Palestinians are angry about the embassy.“I can’t see him actually proposing anything,” Oded Revivi, chief foreign affairs envoy for the Yesha Council, which represents West Bank settlers, said of Mr. Trump. The president seems unlikely to come up with a plan more acceptable than those that have been rejected in the past, Mr. Revivi said, and “he doesn’t want to fail where others have failed.”The meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu, their fifth since the president’s inauguration 13 months ago, demonstrated just how close the two have become while the Palestinians remain off at a distance. The two celebrated Mr. Trump’s decision in December to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the American Embassy there from Tel Aviv in defiance of much of the rest of the world.Mr. Netanyahu extolled Mr. Trump for the decision, comparing him to three of the most important figures in the history of the Jewish people: King Cyrus of Persia, who 2,500 years ago freed the Jews from exile in Babylon and permitted them to return to Jerusalem; Lord Arthur James Balfour, the British foreign secretary whose declaration in 1917 first paved the way for a Jewish homeland in Palestine; and President Harry S. Truman, who recognized Israel’s existence 11 minutes after it declared independence in 1948.Just as Israelis remember those historical figures, Mr. Netanyahu said, “we remember how a few weeks ago President Donald J. Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.”“Mr. President,” he continued, “this will be remembered by our people through the ages. As you just said, others talked about it. You did it.”Unlike Mr. Trump, however, Mr. Netanyahu mentioned the goal of peace with the Palestinians only in passing and focused instead on the topic he always makes his top priority when he visits Washington, namely Iran.He hoped to use the visit to encourage Mr. Trump to tear up President Barack Obama’s agreement with Tehran limiting its nuclear program or renegotiate it to toughen its provisions, particularly with respect to ballistic missiles. He also sought consensus on how to counter Iran’s presence in Syria.“Iran must be stopped,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “That is our common challenge.”He voiced deep skepticism about the prospect of a Palestinian state, recalling how Gaza fell under the control of Hamas after Israel withdrew. “You can bring models, theoretical models, say it will be good if we give them a state,” he told the reporters. “Empirically, it doesn’t work with what we see. When we leave land, terror organizations take it up. Immediately.”Mr. Trump, by contrast, was still more interested in seeking what he has called “the ultimate deal” between Israel and the Palestinians. “We’re working on it very hard,” he said with Mr. Netanyahu at his side in the Oval Office. “Look, it would be a great achievement even from a humanitarian standpoint. What better if we could make peace between Israel and the Palestinians? And I can tell you, we’re working very hard on doing that and I think we have a good chance.”Palestinian leaders, who also claim Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, have given no public indication that they would return to discussions any time soon. In response to the president’s Jerusalem move, they declared that they no longer saw the United States as a neutral broker with the Israelis. Mr. Trump then withheld $65 million in aid for Palestinian refugees.But Mr. Kushner went to the United Nations recently to hear Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, speak in an effort to show respect shortly after the president publicly pressed Israel on settlement construction in the West Bank.The Monday meeting came at a time when both Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu are under increasing domestic pressure from investigations bearing down on them and their families. Shortly before their get-together, Mr. Trump was lashing out at the investigation into whether his team cooperated with Russia during the 2016 election, while reports from Israel indicated that a former confidant of Mr. Netanyahu’s had made a deal with the police in a corruption investigation of the prime minister.“They have an awful lot in common and they both may be desperately in need of a friend and someone who understands what they’re going through,” said Mara Rudman, a former deputy special envoy for Middle East peace under Mr. Obama. “And they happen to be showing it for the world to see.”Mr. Netanyahu later said their mutual woes — they both use the phrase “witch hunt” to describe the inquiries into their activities — never came up during their meeting. Instead, they relished the chance to showcase their partnership during the part of their session when cameras were on.“The relationship has never been better,” Mr. Trump declared.“It’s never been stronger,” Mr. Netanyahu agreed.Mr. Trump has made his decision to move the embassy a selling point among his supporters, lauding it during a recent speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference as one of his major achievements. His administration announced that it would formally open the Jerusalem embassy in May to coincide with the 70th anniversary of Israel’s independence by redesignating an existing consular facility.The president said on Monday that he may attend. “We’re looking at coming,” Mr. Trump said. “If I can, I will.”As he has before, Mr. Trump argued that his decision to recognize Jerusalem resolved a tough issue dividing Israel and the Palestinians. “We’ve taken it off the table,” he said. “So this gives us a real opportunity for peace.”Hardly any veterans of Middle East peacemaking, including some who support moving the embassy, share this view. Mr. Trump’s unilateral declaration does not mean that the Palestinians have given up on Jerusalem; instead, they have dug in. Many former negotiators have envisioned a peace deal in which both sides operate their capitals out of Jerusalem, the Israelis in the west and the Palestinians in the east.As he often does, Mr. Trump boasted that he had already cut the cost of building a new embassy, but he seemed to be conflating two different expenses. “They put an order in front of my desk last week for a billion dollars,” he said. “I said a billion? What’s that for? They said, ‘We’re going to build an embassy.’ I said we’re not going to spend a billion dollars. We’re actually doing it for about $250,000.”The State Department has estimated that construction of a new embassy will cost about $500 million. Mr. Trump’s reference to $250,000 presumably is the cost of making minor adjustments to the existing consular facility so that it can house an office for the American ambassador and be formally redesignated an embassy while a new facility is constructed.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/trump-tariffs-steel-aluminum-nafta.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump, facing an angry chorus of protests from leaders of his own party, including the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, insisted on Monday that he would not back down from his plan to impose across-the-board tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. But the White House was devising ways to potentially soften the impact of the measures on major trading partners.The intense maneuvering, which began before Mr. Trump’s unexpected announcement of the tariffs last Thursday, is likely to delay any formal rollout of the measures until next week, according to several officials who have been briefed on the deliberations.On Monday, Mr. Ryan, the most powerful Republican in the House, broke with the president, declaring through a spokeswoman, “We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan.” The tariffs, Mr. Ryan’s spokeswoman said, would “jeopardize” the economic gains from the recent Republican tax cuts.Mr. Trump appeared little moved by the pushback. One of his all-important barometers — the stock market — rebounded on Monday after falling sharply immediately after the announcement of the tariffs last week as the Republican dissent fueled optimism that Mr. Trump would ultimately reverse course. Opponents of tariffs, including many economists, warn they could damage economic growth by igniting a ruinous trade war, a prospect that Mr. Trump has alternately welcomed or dismissed as unlikely.But a person close to the White House said that the president was itching to impose tariffs, and that Monday’s stock market rebound had reassured Mr. Trump that he was in the right.“We’re not backing down,” the president said at the White House on Monday, as he reeled off a familiar litany about trade deals that he said had driven out factories and deprived American workers of jobs.But Mr. Trump did open the door to a compromise, at least with Canada and Mexico, which are in negotiations with the United States to revise the North American Free Trade Agreement. If the two countries agree to a “new & fair” Nafta, they could be exempt from the tariffs, Mr. Trump said in a tweet on Monday morning.The debate over tariffs has become a litmus test for Mr. Trump, putting his longstanding suspicion of free trade up against the equally fervent support for it among Republicans and members of his own administration.Inside the White House, the debate has pitted hard-liners like Peter Navarro, the president’s trade adviser, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross against more pro-trade voices, like Mr. Trump’s chief economic adviser, Gary D. Cohn, who argue that the measure could disrupt international alliances and global supply chains.Republican lawmakers have criticized tariffs as undercutting the $1.5 trillion tax cut that they worked in lock step to pass last year, saying tariffs are essentially a tax increase that would slow economic growth. On Monday, they floated the idea of congressional action to try to block tariffs, should the president impose them.Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, circulated a letter Monday expressing concern over the tariffs. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, said he spent the weekend speaking with members of Congress and “senior administration officials” about his opposition to the president’s plan.“As you know the administration is split itself,” Mr. Sullivan said from the annual CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, noting that details of the tariffs remain sparse.Mr. Trump has heard all sides’ arguments, but his view has remained steadfast, one White House official said.Still, the official said, the president is mindful enough of the arguments against potentially tanking the stock market that he has been somewhat open to a move to narrow the scope and effects of the tariffs while avoiding the perception that he was relenting. That would echo the approach the administration took to winding down the president’s promises on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which has protected young immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children.The unsettled nature of a final policy was magnified by a conversation on Sunday between Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain.Ms. May, a person briefed on the call said, warned Mr. Trump how dangerous the tariffs would be. Mr. Trump disagreed, but concluded the conversation by telling Ms. May that he had not made a final decision on what to do.The president originally announced that he wanted to put new tariffs into effect this week, but a legal review has not been concluded. On Sunday, Mr. Navarro said the tariff announcement could come this week or the following week at the latest. He also reaffirmed that companies might be able to seek exemptions for certain foreign products they need for their business, a process likely to lead to months of furious lobbying.A coalition of 25 industry associations representing farmers and companies that use steel and aluminum has started lobbying the administration and lawmakers, arguing that the tariffs are far broader than necessary and would create higher prices on American companies that buy and use metals.The president and his advisers have repeatedly maintained that any tariffs will be imposed on imports from all countries without exception. The Commerce Department has concluded that imports of steel and aluminum pose a threat to national security, a determination that gives the president broad authority under United States law to impose tariffs.But that legal standing will undoubtedly be challenged by other countries and companies, both in court and at the World Trade Organization, which requires that members treat all other members equally on trade. Creating exceptions for countries like Canada and Mexico for non-national security reasons like Nafta could invite challenges at the World Trade Organization, said Jennifer Hillman, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center.“Unequivocally, I think there will be cases filed at the W.T.O., and there is plenty of ground to challenge this,” Ms. Hillman said.On Monday, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said Mr. Trump decided to link a tariff exemption to a revised Nafta deal “a couple of days ago” as Mr. Lighthizer prepared to travel to Mexico City to meet with his Mexican and Canadian counterparts.“It makes sense, since this is a major irritant, to have it be considered,” Mr. Lighthizer said in Mexico City after meeting with Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo of Mexico and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland of Canada. He said the situation could be modified for Mexico and Canada given a successful Nafta renegotiation, as well as “perhaps other countries in other contexts where we have those kinds of problems.”Even if Canada and Mexico were exempted from the tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, officials said the United States would impose a quota on those countries’ exports to prevent them from being used as a conduit for metals shipments from other nations.Neither Canada nor Mexico appeared mollified by the prospect of a tariff exemption in exchange for bending to United States demands on Nafta. Ms. Freeland reiterated comments that any action that ensnared Canada would be “completely unacceptable.”“México shouldn’t be included in steel & aluminum tariffs,” Mr. Guajardo said in a tweet. “It’s the wrong way to incentivize the creation of a new & modern #NAFTA.”Michael Camuñez, a former Commerce Department official who advises international firms doing business in Mexico, called the proposed tariffs and the tweet a “terrible development” for the Nafta negotiations “because all parties have indicated that they will not negotiate with a gun against their head.”The talks in Mexico City produced no meaningful progress, and ultimately would be decided by one man — Mr. Trump, Mr. Camuñez said. Negotiators have continued to clash over provisions in the pact, including rules for auto manufacturing, and the United States has continued to insist on changes that its trading partners say are nonstarters.Mr. Camuñez said Mexico and Canada would retaliate “with good reason” if the steel and aluminum tariffs were imposed, an outcome that could lead to a breakdown in negotiations. “That would escalate tensions and that could lead the president to conclude that these negotiations aren’t going anywhere and blame the Mexicans and the Canadians,” Mr. Camuñez said.Mr. Trump has threatened additional retaliation if other nations erect their own trade barriers, saying in a tweet over the weekend that the United States would make it harder for the European Union to sell cars in the country if it imposes tariffs on American imports.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/trade-deficit-tariffs-economists-trump.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s fixation  with America’s widening trade deficit is fueling his decision to impose stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Only a small group of experts share Mr. Trump’s fixation, and few see tariffs as an effective tool to narrow the so-called trade gap.America’s trade deficit is the gap between how much in goods and services it imports from foreign countries, and how much it exports. Mr. Trump complains about the metric frequently, saying the trade imbalance is a measure of America’s weakness on trade policy.“We lost, over the last number of years, $800 billion a year,” he said in the White House on Monday, while defending his tariffs against criticism from Republican leaders in Congress. “Not a half a million dollars, not 12 cents. We lost $800 billion a year on trade.” He went on to say that the country “lost $500 billion” a year to China, though it was not clear what figure he was citing, given that America’s annual trade deficit with China has never climbed beyond $375 billion.Most economists do not see the trade gap as money “lost” to other countries, nor do they worry about trade deficits to a large degree. That’s because trade imbalances are affected by a host of macroeconomic factors, including the relative growth rates of countries, the value of their currencies, and their saving and investment rates. For instance, America’s trade deficit narrowed dramatically during the Great Recession, when national consumption faltered.Mr. Trump has long argued that the trade deficit hinders economic growth, and that reducing it will accelerate American job creation. Even those who agree with that view say there are better ways to reduce the imbalance than through tariffs, which can backfire and further widen the trade deficit if other countries impose reciprocal tariffs.“If you look across countries, there’s no evidence that high tariffs reduce your trade deficit,” said Joseph E. Gagnon, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and a co-author of a 2017 book of policy recommendations on how to reduce trade imbalances.“The trade deficit is a terrible metric for judging economic policy,” said Lawrence H. Summers, a Harvard economist and former chairman of President Barack Obama’s National Economic Council. Mr. Summers said tariffs would actually worsen deficits by making American companies that ship steel and aluminum overseas less competitive, and by inviting foreign retaliatory tariffs against other exports.A year ago, Mr. Trump signed an executive order directing the Commerce Department and the United States trade representative to conduct a 90-day review on the causes of America’s persistent trade deficits. That review has not yet been released. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reported last month that the trade deficit grew to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2017, up from 2.7 percent the year before.The deficit in goods alone with China grew to $375 billion last year, an 8 percent increase from 2016.The deficit in goods and services is on pace to reach about $330 billion, depending on fourth-quarter data that has not yet been reported, which would also be an increase from the year before.The tangible source of America’s persistent trade deficit with China is consumer goods: electronics, housewares and so much else that Americans buy regularly at Walmart or Costco. Those deficits have been exacerbated, economists generally agree, through concerted action by the Chinese government to prop up exports, by holding down the value of China’s currency and directly subsidizing some exporting industries.When it was admitted to the World Trade Organization in 2001, China got access to markets around the world and in turn committed to opening its own markets to countries such as the United States, said Eswar S. Prasad, a trade economist at Cornell University. “China did not keep up its end of the bargain,” Mr. Prasad said. “It did not provide easy access to its own markets. And for a long period after the Asian financial crisis — 2000 until the end of that decade — they gave themselves a competitive advantage by holding down the value of their currency.”The United States actually runs a trade surplus in services with China, as it does with many other countries, in part by attracting Chinese students to study at American colleges, which counts as an export.Mr. Prasad and most other trade experts say bilateral trade deficits are not a good measure of whether countries are living up to their promises on market access, or whether certain countries are better negotiators of trade agreements. They compare the global economy to a neighborhood. Consumers might spend a lot of money with a shopkeeper who never buys anything from their store in return, but they also receive money from other customers whose stores they never frequent.“A bilateral balance doesn’t really tell you anything about what the economy is doing,” said Scott Lincicome, an adjunct fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, “just like my bilateral deficit with my grocery store doesn’t tell you anything about whether I’m in debt.”Mr. Trump’s own Council of Economic Advisers, in a report last month, seemed to play down alarms over bilateral trade deficits. “The United States has a bilateral goods deficit and a services surplus with many of its major trading partners,” council members wrote. “Overall, the United States has a goods deficit and a services surplus with the world. The services surplus is consistent with the structure of the private sector, which has evolved during the last few decades toward more services output as a share of G.D.P.”Economists who share Mr. Trump’s concern with the overall trade deficit, or at least some degree of it, say there are better ways than tariffs to reduce it. Dean Baker, a liberal economist who writes frequently on trade policy, said targeting currency values is the best route; if other countries’ currencies strengthen relative to the dollar, it becomes more attractive for their consumers to buy American exports.Mr. Gagnon has a list of recommendations but said one dwarfs all others: reducing America’s growing federal budget deficit, which is fueling foreign investment in the United States as the government turns to other nations to finance its spending.“There are things we could do,” he said, “but I hate to recommend them when we’re not doing the most important thing, which is bring down our massive fiscal deficit.”Mr. Trump, he noted, recently signed  sweeping tax cuts that will add an estimated $1 trillion to federal deficits over the next 10 years, even after accounting for the faster growth it could bring.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/trump-trade-tariffs-nafta.html","WASHINGTON — Paul D. Ryan, the Republican House speaker, criticized President Trump’s proposed steel and aluminum tariffs on Monday, saying they could lead to a damaging trade war.“We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan,” a spokeswoman for Mr. Ryan said in a statement. “The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don’t want to jeopardize those gains.”The statement was a dramatic departure for Mr. Ryan, a top leader in Mr. Trump’s own party, who worked in lockstep with the president to pass a $1.5 trillion tax cut last year. While other Republican lawmakers have come out against the president’s trade action, this was Mr. Ryan’s first public comment since Mr. Trump announced last week that he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.Mr. Trump has shown no sign that he plans to retreat from the trade action. On Monday, he used the tariffs to threaten two of the United States’ closest trading partners, saying in a tweet that the tariffs would only “come off” of Canada and Mexico if a new and “fair” multilateral trade pact was signed.The statement continued Mr. Trump’s running Twitter defense of the tariffs, which he has positioned as necessary to help the United States protect itself against foreign competitors. But his administration continues to sow confusion over the breadth, scope and legality of the tariffs on steel and aluminum that Mr. Trump announced last Thursday. The White House has said those tariffs would apply to imports from all countries with no exemptions.Mr. Trump’s tweet came as the United States, Mexico and Canada are wrapping up the seventh round of talks over the North American Free Trade Agreement in Mexico City. Negotiators have continued to clash over provisions in the pact, including rules for auto manufacturing, and the United States has continued to insist on changes that its trading partners say are nonstarters.“We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada,” the president tweeted Monday. “NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U.S.A.”Opening up exceptions for countries like Canada and Mexico for other factors like Nafta could also invite more challenges at the World Trade Organization, said Jennifer Hillman, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center. That body requires that members treat all other members equally when it comes to trade. “Unequivocally, I think there will be cases filed at the WTO, and there is plenty of ground to challenge this,” Ms. Hillman said.On Sunday, two of the president’s top trade advisers defended the tariff plan but left room for the president to change his mind. Peter Navarro, the head of the White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, said the tariff announcement could come this week or the following week at the latest. Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, acknowledged that the president could change his mind, while adding that he had no reason to do so.The president’s announcement was cheered by steel and aluminum companies but rattled stock markets, allies and industries that purchase metal to make their products, who could see their prices rise as a result. The European Union, Canada and other countries have already threated retaliation on American products and cases against the United States at the W.T.O. Mr. Trump has threatened additional retaliation in response, saying in a tweet over the weekend that the United States would make it harder for the European Union to sell cars here if it erects trade barriers on American imports.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/politics/trump-white-house-chaos.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump pushed back on Tuesday against reports that his White House is in chaos, following the resignations of senior staff members and as the special counsel’s investigation into Russian election meddling inched closer to his inner circle.In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump said “people will always come & go.” He added, “There is no Chaos, only great Energy!”It was an odd defense for a man who has thrived on chaos and has used it as a way to both organize people and manage them.In his tweet, Mr. Trump suggested more resignations may be coming: “I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection).”The New York Times and others reported on the cascading chaos of last week, with the announcement of the resignation of one of his longest-serving aides, Hope Hicks, and the threat of another staff resignation after Mr. Trump announced a new trade policy against the advice of one of his top economic advisers, Gary D. Cohn.Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, had his security clearance downgraded, significantly limiting his access to some of the most serious national security issues the president faces. The White House also pushed back on rumors that Mr. Trump planned to fire his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster. Mr. Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, resigned early last year and is cooperating with the special counsel in its ongoing investigation.The president’s tweet about chaos was one of several on a range of topics, including immigration policy and the prospects of a denuclearized North Korea. Mr. Trump was also critical of the Oscars record-low ratings. He said, “Problem is, we don’t have Stars anymore — except your President (just kidding, of course)!”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/upshot/texas-primary-democrats-voter-enthusiasm-turnout.html","The 2018 elections formally begin with the Texas primary on Tuesday, and early voting tallies are already being interpreted as yet another sign of Democratic strength heading into the midterms.It’s not without reason. In early voting, Democratic primary voters outnumbered Republicans in Texas by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent. The number of Democratic early voters, presumably motivated in part by distaste for President Trump, more than doubled compared with 2014.The surging Democratic tallies are even viewed by some as a sign that Texas may emerge as a fairly competitive state in the midterm elections.Is that a reasonable conclusion? Looking back at primary elections since 2004, there’s some reason to think so. Without obvious extenuating circumstances (like a high-profile presidential primary for one party but not the other), primary performance can be cautiously interpreted as a harbinger of the general election.In terms of this year’s midterm elections, there are two ways to look at the primaries: at the national level; and by state and district. Over all, the national primary vote is a rough if imperfect indicator of the national political environment. The primary vote by state and district is an equally rough, though potentially more analytically useful, measure of partisanship.NationallyPerhaps the most straightforward way to judge whether primary results can foreshadow the general election is to compare the primary vote of the average congressional district with the eventual average congressional district result in the midterm election.This seems to do a decent job of prediction, based on limited data going back to 2004, using vote history data from L2, a nonpartisan vendor of voter files. The two notable exceptions — 2004 and 2012 — are fairly easily dismissed, since only one party had a presidential primary in those years. However, there just aren’t many data points, so caution is warranted.In a way, primaries resemble special elections. Nonpresidential primaries are relatively low-turnout affairs that provide a clue about which side’s base is more engaged. That’s extremely important in midterm elections.But there are differences, too: Primary turnout is less volatile than in special elections, which often have ultralow voter participation. Primaries occur in almost every jurisdiction in the country, while special elections (particularly if analyzed without adjusting for population) are often deeply unrepresentative. And primaries are partisan ballots, not contests between two candidates of different parties, so you can interpret their results as a more direct proxy for partisanship preference.State and DistrictThe national primary vote might be somewhat predictive of the national House vote, but it isn’t nearly so simple to make a similar prediction by state or district.How could that be? In most states, voters are confined to one party in the primary but may vote for whoever they like in the general. So the primary vote is an imperfect measure of partisan preference, not a measure of how voters feel about a particular race.But that doesn’t mean it’s useless. Presidential vote choice, the most common indicator of a district’s partisanship, is also a deeply imperfect measure, so there’s value in adding the primaries to the mix.There are places like West Virginia, where Republicans dominate in presidential elections but where the right kind of Democrat can take advantage of the state’s latent Democratic tradition. Conor Lamb might be doing so in the special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th District, which adjoins West Virginia and still has a Democratic registration advantage. And there are places like Orange County, Calif., or the suburbs of Dallas and Atlanta where one could wonder whether a strongly Republican tradition will cut against Democratic chances in places where Mr. Trump struggled.The primary vote is another good measure of the partisan makeup of a state.Take one of this year’s first primary states: Illinois. Based on recent presidential election results, it might appear that a Republican incumbent, Mike Bost, should be well positioned to hold a district that Mr. Trump won by 15 points. But this district has a strong Democratic tradition; Senator Tammy Duckworth actually carried Mr. Bost’s district by more than a 10-point margin against an incumbent Republican last November.Primary votes there reveal the district’s Democratic tradition: Even in 2016, Democratic primary voters outnumbered Republicans in the presidential primary. This suggests that Mr. Bost might be much more vulnerable than the typical Republican in a district that voted for Mr. Trump by so much.It’s possible that Mr. Trump’s presidency has realigned partisanship along the lines of the 2016 presidential election, and that Mr. Bost, for example, will be fairly safe in his district. If true, the primaries will be one of our first clues.Democrats might see a big surge in primary turnout in well-educated, traditionally Republican areas, like the suburbs of Dallas or Houston. In 2016, the primary vote there was 2-to-1 in favor of the Republicans.The primary vote does a decent job of anticipating this kind of change in partisan allegiance. Democratic primary strength has steadily eroded in many Southern states where the party was once strong in down-ballot races, for instance.But that doesn’t mean you can just take primary results at face value. In Indiana, the 2008 Democratic primary yielded a spike in Democratic turnout that presaged a Democratic surge in the general. But the Republicans didn’t have a competitive presidential primary at all — so you couldn’t look at the overall primary vote breakdown and conclude that the state was now solidly Democratic.The competitive Democratic primary in the 2010 Arkansas Senate race probably kept the state’s primary vote from trending toward the Republicans in that year, even as politically similar Tennessee broke hard toward the Republicans.The lesson is that it’s difficult to read too much into the result of a single primary. It may be more useful to look at multiple years of data, in part because there are unique circumstances in individual primaries, like whether one party had a high-profile contest to generate national media coverage. It’s also important to consider the circumstances in each state, such as whether the primary contest is open or closed. But if you can account for this, there’s useful information.In Texas, Republicans are counting on the state’s G.O.P. tradition to insulate them from Mr. Trump’s unpopularity. That’s especially true in well-educated, suburban districts like Texas’ Seventh or 32nd District, where Mr. Trump lost but Republicans traditionally have a 2-to-1 edge in the primary vote. In theory, that kind of Republican tradition should be a meaningful drag on Democratic chances compared with the typical area where Mr. Trump was defeated.A strong Democratic showing in a partisan primary in Texas would indicate that Republicans can’t count on vestigial partisan strength to insulate them from Mr. Trump’s distinct weakness among college-educated voters.Alone, a Democratic primary ballot victory won’t make the Democrats favorites in any of Texas’ Republican-held congressional districts, let alone statewide. But it would suggest that Republicans should not be optimistic about their chances to survive a wave election in Texas, and in well-educated, traditionally Republican suburbs elsewhere across the country.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/business/media/paul-schweizer-google-facebook.html","Conservatives are zeroing in on a new enemy in the political culture wars: Big Tech.Arguing that Silicon Valley is stifling their speech and suppressing right-wing content, publishers and provocateurs on the right are eyeing a public-relations battle against online giants like Google and Facebook, the same platforms they once relied on to build a national movement.In a sign of escalation, Peter Schweizer, a right-wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton, plans to release a new film focusing on technology companies and their role in filtering the news.Tentatively titled “The Creepy Line,” Mr. Schweizer’s documentary is expected to have its first screening in May in Cannes, France — during the Cannes Film Festival, but not as part of the official competition. He used the same rollout two years ago for his previous film, an adaptation of his book “Clinton Cash” that he produced with Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News.”The Creepy Line” alludes to an infamous 2010 speech by Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google at the time, who dismissed concerns about privacy by declaring that his company’s policy was “to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it.”The documentary, which has not been previously reported, dovetails with concerns raised in recent weeks by right-wing groups about censorship on digital media — a new front in a rapidly evolving culture war.If the mainstream media is a perennial enemy of the right, Big Tech is a fresh and novel foe, arguably more relevant to 2018. Facebook, Google and their ilk are facing tough questions about their inability to police the content they distribute, including Russian propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. The companies have also been accused by lawmakers, critics and activists of monopolistic tendencies and manipulative product design.The critique from conservatives, in contrast, casts the big tech companies as censorious and oppressive, all too eager to stifle right-wing content in an effort to mollify liberal critics.“This could end up being the free speech issue of our time,” said Alex Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart News, which has published articles accusing Google and Facebook of, among other sins, political bias. “The Silicon Valley elites are saying: ‘We don’t care what you want to see — we know what you should see. We know better.’”Big Tech is easily associated with West Coast liberalism and Democratic politics, making it a fertile target for the right. And operational opacity at Facebook, Google and Twitter, which are reluctant to reveal details about their algorithms and internal policies, can leave them vulnerable, too.“It’s the perfect foil,” said Eli Pariser, a former executive director of the liberal activist group MoveOn.org and the author of “The Filter Bubble,” a book about how consumers find information online. “There’s not even a real basis to establish objective research about what’s happening on Facebook, because it’s closed.”Google, Facebook and Twitter loomed large at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., where dozens of guests squeezed into a standing-room-only ballroom for a discussion called “Suppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.”Among the panelists were James O’Keefe, the guerrilla filmmaker who has tried to undermine news outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN, and James Damore, an engineer fired by Google after he circulated a memo arguing that biological differences accounted for the low number of women in engineering.Mr. Damore — a new celebrity in the right-wing world, who, in an interview, said of his first foray to CPAC, “There’s definitely a lot of people that want to take selfies” — described a culture of dogmatic liberalism at Google.“There are political activists in all of these companies that want to actively push a liberal agenda,” he said. “Why does it matter? Because these companies are so ubiquitous and powerful that they are controlling all the means of mass communication.”Before Mr. Damore spoke, organizers distributed baseball caps to guests emblazoned with an illustration of Twitter’s bird logo, upside-down and with its eyes crossed out.The panelists accused social media platforms of delisting their videos or stripping them of advertising. Such charges have long been staples of far-right online discourse, especially among YouTubers, but Mr. Schweizer’s project is poised to bring such arguments to a new — and potentially larger — audience.Mr. Schweizer, 53, was a speechwriting consultant to President George W. Bush. His reporting has been cited by The Times and “60 Minutes,” although he often uses a bombastic style akin to that of Breitbart News.He is also the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit organization. He and Mr. Bannon founded it with funding from the family of Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund manager and donor to Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign.Mr. Schweizer declined to identify the film’s financial backers. A spokeswoman for the institute said it was not involved in the project.In some ways, the complaints from the right about Big Tech mirror the grumblings of legacy news organizations, which have expressed concern that online algorithms wield too much power over how readers gain access to their content.Jeffrey A. Zucker, the president of CNN, derided Google and Facebook as “monopolies” and called for regulators to step in during a speech in Spain last month, saying the tech hegemony is “the biggest issue facing the growth of journalism in the years ahead.” And former President Barack Obama said at an off-the-record conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last month that he worried Americans were living in “entirely different realities” and that large tech companies like Facebook were “not just an invisible platform, they’re shaping our culture in powerful ways.” The contents of the speech were published by Reason magazine.In the right’s more internet-savvy quarters, tech platforms have been a regular — and fruitful — subject of discussion since before the 2016 election. In May that year, Facebook was forced to respond to claims that the curators of its Trending Topics feature had suppressed conservative news sources, a controversy that called attention to Facebook’s editorial power.That charge of editorial bias was echoed last weekend by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, who accused YouTube of planning to delete his organization’s account, a claim that was widely shared among conservatives.YouTube did delete some videos that accused teenage survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting of being “crisis actors,” and it issued “strikes,” or warnings, to the accounts of Infowars and Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and Infowars contributor. (YouTube denied that it had plans to delete the Infowars account.)Facebook has also caught flak for adjusting  the algorithm for its News Feed to emphasize posts from “friends, family and groups” over content from public pages. The change was part of an effort by the company to answer criticism, but also to reinvigorate its oldest and most profitable product, which recently recorded a decline in American daily users for the first time in its history.The Facebook adjustment has affected virtually every media organization that is partly dependent on the platform for audiences, but it appears to have hit some harder than others. They include right-wing sites like Gateway Pundit and the millennial-focused Independent Journal Review, which was forced to lay off staff members last month.The social news giant BuzzFeed recently bought ads on Facebook with the message, “Facebook is taking the news out of your News Feed, but we’ve got you covered,” directing users to download its app. Away from the political scrum, the viral lifestyle site LittleThings, once a top publisher on the platform, announced last week that it would cease operations, blaming “a full-on catastrophic update” to Facebook’s revised algorithms.Right-wing media has pounced. In late February, citing statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip, Breitbart published an article on the effects on the president’s Facebook page with the headline “EXCLUSIVE: Trump’s Facebook Engagement Declined By 45 Percent Following Algorithm Change.” The drop, the article insinuated, occurred “following a year of pressure from left-wing employees and the mainstream media for ‘allowing’ the president to win the 2016 general election.”Still, the brewing backlash did not stop Google and Facebook from courting the very crowd that now seems ready to declare them enemies. Both companies were sponsors at this year’s CPAC, leading to a few awkward moments.Facebook, which sponsored a “help desk” for attendees featuring smiling representatives and cookies frosted with emoji icons, provided a demonstration of its virtual reality program, Oculus. But the company was forced to apologize for including a first-person shooter simulation, given that the conference took place a week after the Parkland massacre.Google, which has co-sponsored CPAC three of the past six years, held a lavish reception for attendees featuring an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.Mr. Marlow, the editor of Breitbart, was asked in an interview what he thought about Google’s giving a party in the midst of a crowd that is gunning for it.“The least they can do,” Mr. Marlow said, “is buy us a drink.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/us/politics/bryant-neal-vinas-terrorism-cooperation-fbi-witness-protection.html","Bryant Neal Vinas, a convicted terrorist from Long Island, showed up recently for dinner at Katz’s Delicatessen on the Lower East Side in oversize glasses with black rims, a thin attempt to alter his appearance.After he was released from federal prison last year, Mr. Vinas assumed he would have no need for a disguise. He thought he was going into witness protection, with a home far away and a new identity, after he helped the American government battle Al Qaeda as one of the most important cooperators in the government’s fight against terrorism.Captured in 2008 after training for months at Qaeda camps, Mr. Vinas quickly turned on his fellow jihadists and began helping American investigators dismantle the group. Even the federal judge who sentenced him described his cooperation as “remarkable.”“I helped them kill my friends,” Mr. Vinas explained while eating pastrami on a hoagie roll with mayonnaise, his choice of condiment drawing a weird look from his lawyer and the waiter. He added, “If that doesn’t show how you’re willing to turn your life around, I don’t know what will.”But the government decided against giving him protection, and Mr. Vinas, 35, has found himself unexpectedly back in New York, where he was raised and converted to Islam more than a decade ago. The F.B.I. and the Justice Department declined to comment, but a senior government official said there were concerns about whether Mr. Vinas would adapt to the program and potential conflicts with law enforcement officials who administer the witness protection program.Nonetheless, the decision could affect future government cases as defense lawyers weigh whether to help prosecutors. The F.B.I. and federal prosecutors have long relied on informants to build cases against mob bosses, crooked Wall Street traders and drug dealers, and current and former law enforcement officials questioned whether potential cooperators would decline to help the government without a guarantee of safety in return.“How often do you get an American who went into Al Qaeda?” asked Jack Cloonan, a former F.B.I. agent who investigated the group. “I would think you would want to do everything you could for him. If I were the agent, I would be hard-pressed to accept this.”In a series of interviews, his first since being freed, Mr. Vinas gave an unusually revealing look at life inside Al Qaeda. He spoke of a training camp, where he slept in flea-ridden sleeping bags but befriended other young men from around the world, and gained access to Qaeda leaders, who discussed with him the most effective ways to cause mass destruction inside the United States. He suggested blowing up the Long Island Rail Road, or a Walmart.Mr. Vinas became interested in Islam before the Sept. 11 attacks after meeting a Muslim woman at a mall. He converted in 2004 at a mosque in Queens, did odd jobs in New York and eventually fell under the spell of Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical cleric and Qaeda recruiter in Yemen whose YouTube videos were popular among Islamic extremists.Mr. Vinas had few prospects and even less money, and had grown distant from his family. As the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq dragged on, he grew to hate American foreign policy and thought he had a moral and religious obligation to defend Muslims.Fighting in Afghanistan, he thought, would give him a purpose.“If I had had a future, it would have been different,” he said.He traveled to Lahore, Pakistan, in 2007 and eventually linked up with militants who provided training and took him to Afghanistan. Six months later, Mr. Vinas was living at a safe house in Waziristan, a tribal area in northwest Pakistan, with Qaeda recruits from Egypt, Kuwait, Turkey and Saudi Arabia.By March 2008, Mr. Vinas had begun basic training at a Qaeda camp in northwest Pakistan. The living arrangements were primitive; trainees had to share the flea-infested sleeping bags. The food — rice, potato stew and boiled roots — gave him diarrhea and dysentery.He met many Qaeda leaders, including Saleh al-Somali, the chief of external operations, who planned an attack on New York’s subways that the F.B.I. thwarted.In a conversation with Younis al-Mauritani, a senior Qaeda member, Mr. Vinas suggested bombing the Long Island Rail Road as a way to hurt the New York economy.“It was just an idea that was talked about,” Mr. Vinas recalled. He also advised attacking a Walmart, but the idea was dismissed.Mr. Vinas made friends easily, like a Pakistani who had lived in Texas and loved barbecue and the Grateful Dead. Mr. Vinas’s closest friend was a gregarious 6-foot-5, 300-pound Kuwaiti who enjoyed American fast food and spoke excellent English.Mr. Vinas said his friend wanted to be a suicide bomber because it was “one click to paradise.” But Al Qaeda instead made him work on its newsletter.As much as Al Qaeda hated the West, he said, the group’s fighters enjoyed its exports, like Pepsi and Danish yogurt. He said Mr. Somali raved about McDonald’s and Hardee’s.Many of the people he met died in drone strikes.The Pakistani authorities arrested Mr. Vinas in October 2008 in the Hayatabad neighborhood of Peshawar, where he had traveled to find a wife. The Pakistanis interrogated him, he said, and notified the American government that he had been caught. Mr. Vinas recalled thinking that he would be sent to the United States military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.Instead, he was flown to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and then to New York to be prosecuted. “It was a long trip,” Mr. Vinas said, and members of the F.B.I.-led Joint Terrorism Task Force took him to Katz’s after his arrest.“A pastrami sandwich can really soften a hard heart,” Mr. Vinas said.He immediately started providing information to the F.B.I. and pleaded guilty in 2009 to federal terrorism charges.He was later transferred to a federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., and put in the witness security program inside its walls, according to former law enforcement officials. He had company: gang members, mobsters and another valuable F.B.I. informant, Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali terrorist captured in international waters near Yemen in 2011.Mr. Vinas spent eight years at Otisville.In all, he took part in 100 interviews, reviewed 1,000 photographs and helped in more than 30 law enforcement investigations, according to prosecutors. Prosecutors have said he was the “single most valuable cooperating witness” about Qaeda activities spanning his time in Afghanistan and Pakistan.Last year, a federal judge sentenced Mr. Vinas to just three more months in prison based on the belief that he was headed to witness protection. The judge was “cautiously optimistic” that Mr. Vinas, who he agreed was a “complex individual,” would stay out of trouble. Mr. Vinas thought he was going to “fade into oblivion somewhere” in witness protection.Federal prosecutors as well as the F.B.I. agents who handled the case pushed hard for witness protection, said Steve Zissou, Mr. Vinas’s lawyer, who believes that Mr. Vinas remains in danger.“That’s not what we do to people who help the United States,” he said. “Vinas paid his dues. At the minimum, he should be given an opportunity to rebuild his life and be safe and secure.”“He never hurt anybody,” Mr. Zissou continued.The information that cooperators provide on people and places beyond the F.B.I.’s reach helps the bureau make cases it likely could not otherwise.“Cooperators are critical because you need an insider’s view,” said Christopher LaVigne, a former federal terrorism prosecutor in Manhattan. “It’s almost essential at terrorism trials. There’s only so much you can obtain and use from overseas.”The government, he said, has to live up to its obligations: “Cooperation is a two-way street.”But one day before he was released, Mr. Vinas learned that he would not be granted protection, angering the judge and Mr. Zissou. The Justice Department’s Office of Enforcement Operations, which approves or denies program applications, conducted a review and turned down Mr. Vinas, the senior government official said. A psychologist who examined Mr. Vinas during his final days in prison said he could be a possible threat to the people protecting him. The psychological evaluation caught everyone off guard, including the judge and Mr. Zissou.Mr. Zissou dismissed the assessment. “He’s not a threat to anybody,” Mr. Zissou said. Another psychologist evaluated Mr. Vinas after his release and said he was not a danger, but the Office of Enforcement Operations did not change its decision.The F.B.I. put him in an extended-stay hotel in New York. Farbod Azad, the F.B.I. agent on his case, once brought him Fruity Pebbles and milk. Mr. Vinas thought that was a nice gesture, but then Mr. Azad said the F.B.I. was done paying for the room.Another government agency paid for another month, Mr. Zissou said, and then Mr. Vinas was sent to what is known as a three-quarters house in New York. He wears an ankle monitor and has a curfew.Mr. Vinas is now on food stamps and Medicaid. He does odd jobs for his lawyer and has had little luck finding a job. He applied to Uber Eats but never heard back. He considered washing windows, but the union said it was not accepting applications.Mr. Vinas realizes he cannot escape what he did. He is still hopeful about his future, but he knows he will not be living anonymously. Perhaps what happened is a blessing.“I don’t have to hide anymore,” he said. “And I am not going to live in fear.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/health/trump-medicaid-arkansas.html","WASHINGTON — Arkansas will be the third state to require many Medicaid recipients to work or train for jobs, after the Trump administration granted it permission on Monday.But the administration held off on approving another request from the state that could have much broader consequences for the future of the program — a proposal to cut back the expansion of Medicaid that was instituted under the Affordable Care Act.Seema Verma, the Trump appointee who oversees Medicaid, did not elaborate when asked twice about the delay at a news conference with Gov. Asa Hutchinson in Little Rock. She said only: “We are still working through some issues in that particular area.”She and Mr. Hutchinson, a Republican, sought instead to emphasize the momentum that work requirements have gathered in the two months since Ms. Verma issued guidance to states allowing them to insist that many people work or prepare for jobs as a condition of keeping their Medicaid coverage. Ms. Verma said eight additional states had submitted work proposals and nine others had signaled interest in the requirements, the first such limits in the more than 50 years since the program was created to provide health insurance to poor Americans.Mr. Hutchinson, who is running for re-election, exhibited the zeal with which Republicans have pursued work requirements this year, saying he expected to roll out Arkansas’s even before the states that already won approval to do so, Kentucky and Indiana.“We are ready with our systems,” Mr. Hutchinson said, noting the state had been preparing for more than a year. “This will be going fairly quickly.”The Arkansas work requirements are somewhat softer than those of the other two states. People younger than 50 will be expected to work, or to train or search for jobs; attend school full time or volunteer — 80 hours a month. Kentucky and Indiana are imposing the requirement on people younger than 65 and 60, respectively. But Arkansas’s plan has harsher consequences for not meeting the requirement: those who do not comply for three months out of a year will be locked out of coverage until the following year.“This is not about punishing anyone,” Mr. Hutchinson said. “It’s about giving people an opportunity to work. It’s about giving them the training they need. It’s about helping them move out of poverty and up the economic ladder.”So far, only one other state, Massachusetts, has joined Arkansas in seeking permission to roll back its Medicaid expansion, and make the program available only to people with incomes below the federal poverty level: $12,060 for a single person, or about twice that amount for a family of four. Under the terms of the Affordable Care Act, states that chose to expand Medicaid had to provide it to everyone with incomes up to 138 percent of that level: $16,642 for a single person.But if the Trump administration allows Arkansas to scale back its Medicaid expansion population, some of the other 31 states that expanded the program will likely want to follow, as a way to save money and appease conservative legislators who think the Obamacare expansion went too far. Other states may be tempted to expand Medicaid, after holding back for years, if they can limit it to those earning at or below the poverty level. The federal government initially paid the full cost of the expansion, but now states are on the hook for 6 percent of the cost; their share will gradually grow to 10 percent over the next few years.The Arkansas proposal would move about 60,000 people out of the program, by lowering the income threshold to the federal poverty level.Mr. Hutchinson wants those earning between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level to move to the Affordable Care Act marketplace, where they would get federal subsidies to buy private insurance. But that could end up costing the federal government more money — another reason the Trump administration may be slow to approve it. President Trump frequently refers to the marketplaces as “failing” and has taken a number of steps to weaken them.Regardless, Mr. Hutchinson said Monday he was optimistic about winning approval to shrink the expansion population after meeting recently with Alex Azar, the new Health and Human Services secretary.Mr. Hutchinson has long been under pressure from conservative Republicans in the Arkansas legislature who say the Medicaid expansion has proved too expensive, with far more people enrolling than originally estimated.Arkansas is anticipating spending about $136 million in general revenue on its Medicaid expansion in the coming fiscal year, with the federal government spending an additional $2 billion. The state uses federal Medicaid funds to buy private insurance for the poor — an alternative that conservative Republicans found acceptable when it was first passed in 2013. About 285,000 people are now enrolled in the Medicaid expansion.Cindy Gillespie, the director of the Arkansas Department of Human Services, said the state was planning to activate an online portal on March 30 where those subject to the requirement will be expected to record how they’re meeting it each month. In June, the state will start phasing it in, relying largely on its Department of Workforce services to connect job seekers with employment, education or training.Kentucky, for its part, is sending out the first notices about its work requirement this week and plans to start rolling it out in July. Indiana will not roll out its work requirement until next year.Like Kentucky and Indiana, Arkansas will exempt people who qualify as “medically frail” from the work requirement, as well as those who are pregnant, in treatment for substance abuse, in school full time or caring for children or someone incapacitated. Nor will those who qualified for Medicaid before the Obamacare expansion — children and disabled or elderly adults — be subject to it.Only people from the ages of 30 through 49 will be subject to the requirement this year, and state officials have estimated that about 60 percent of them — 59,714 out of 98,632 — either work already or will qualify for exemptions.Younger enrollees, down to the age of 19, will be subject to the work requirement starting next year.The National Health Law Program, a nonprofit advocacy group that has already sued to stop Kentucky’s work requirement, said Monday that Arkansas’s also “appears well outside the bounds of the limited authority” that the Department of Health and Human Services has to change Medicaid provisions.“The state’s work requirement program, beyond being legally suspect, will disproportionately harm the most underserved populations,” said Jane Perkins, the program’s legal director.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/thad-cochran-retire-senate.html","WASHINGTON — Senator Thad Cochran, an octogenarian Republican from Mississippi who serves as chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee, announced Monday that he is resigning from the Senate on April 1 because of ill health — a decision that will create two Senate races in his home state in November.“I regret my health has become an ongoing challenge,” Mr. Cochran, 80, said in a statement. “I intend to fulfill my responsibilities and commitments to the people of Mississippi and the Senate through the completion of the 2018 appropriations cycle, after which I will formally retire from the U.S. Senate.”Mr. Cochran, who previously served three terms in the House, was first elected to the Senate in 1978, becoming the first Republican in more than 100 years to win a statewide election in Mississippi. He is the tenth-longest serving senator in United States history.Senator Roger Wicker, the junior Republican senator from Mississippi, is already running for re-election this year and has drawn a primary challenge from the same firebrand state senator, Chris McDaniel, who nearly unseated Mr. Cochran in 2014.Mr. Cochran’s retirement means that Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, will have 10 days to appoint an interim senator. A special election would then be held on Election Day in November to fill the rest of Mr. Cochran’s term, which expires in 2020.Multiple Republican officials said Mr. Bryant was likely to pick somebody who would run for the seat in November, avoiding a caretaker. The question now is whether Mr. McDaniel will drop his challenge to Mr. Wicker and try to claim Mr. Cochran’s seat.Mr. McDaniel, a hard-line conservative with a history of making inflammatory statements, had remained silent about his 2018 intentions for months, waiting to see whether Mr. Cochran would resign. By waiting until Monday to reveal his intention to step down, Mr. Cochran effectively forced Mr. McDaniel to enter the race against Mr. Wicker.Yet even as he formally declared his bid last week, Mr. McDaniel did not rule out changing races.“While it is certain that Mississippi will have two U.S. Senate races this year, I am currently focused on my campaign against Roger Wicker,” he said in a statement Monday, “but all options remain on the table as we determine the best way to ensure that Mississippi elects conservatives to the United States Senate.”Mr. Wicker, for his part, was asked by reporters at the Capitol if he was relieved to see Mr. Cochran step aside. “No,” he said. “It’s sad news.”Mr. Bryant has not offered any hints about whom he would appoint to replace Mr. Cochran, but Republicans close to the governor said he would not choose Mr. McDaniel.Immediately after Mr. Cochran put out word on Monday that he would leave the Senate after nearly four decades, the senator’s top aide and close adviser, Brad White, said, “I hope he appoints somebody who can win a general election.”Asked if that includes Mr. McDaniel, Mr. White said, “No.”President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, have encouraged Mr. Bryant to appoint himself, arguing that the party needs to block Mr. McDaniel and forestall any potential replay of the Roy S. Moore debacle last year in Alabama that handed the Democrats a seat in the Deep South.Mr. Bryant has to date resisted the entreaties. If he does not take the seat, the governor is expected to consider Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who is also thought to want to run for governor when Mr. Bryant becomes term-limited in 2019, and Secretary of State Delbert Hoseman. Other possibilities include the State House speaker, Philip Gun, and the state auditor, Stacey Pickering.Democrats have not won a Senate race in Mississippi since 1982, when the veteran Senator John Stennis defeated Haley Barbour, but state and national Republicans worry about whether their grip on the state’s two seats could be in peril should Mr. McDaniel find success. Last week, David Baria, the State House Democratic leader, announced his intention to run for Mr. Wicker’s seat. Democrats have also wooed Brandon Presley, a cousin to Elvis Presley and the chairman of the state’s Public Service Commission, to run for the Senate.Mike Espy, a former Democratic congressman and agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration, said late Monday that he would consider running for Mr. Cochran’s seat.Mr. Espy, who is African-American and from a prominent Delta family, could be a formidable candidate in a state where black voters make up much of the Democratic Party.Democrats are watching which race Mr. McDaniel chooses, hoping to put their most formidable candidate against the state senator.Mr. Cochran has been a genteel presence in the Senate for decades, but in recent years his physical decline has become apparent. On Monday, as the Senate voted on two judicial nominations, he was guided into the chamber by aides and was silent as reporters peppered him with questions.His decision to leave opens up the coveted chairman’s spot on the Senate Appropriations Committee, where leadership is determined by seniority. The senator next in line is Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama. Asked if he wants the job, Mr. Shelby said, “It would be a great honor, but I’m not there yet,” and added, “I would be interested at the proper time.”Longtime members of the Senate said they were sorry to see Mr. Cochran go. “I’m devastated,” said Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the most senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.“I assumed we would serve out our time together here,” Mr. Leahy said, adding, “He has always, always, always kept his word, and I wish to heck some other senators around here would learn to do that.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/sam-nunberg-special-counsel-grand-jury.html","WASHINGTON — It began with a subpoena. It ended with a question about whether its recipient was drunk on live television.Sam Nunberg, a onetime Trump campaign aide who recently met with investigators for the special counsel, set cable news alight on Monday when he declared that he was subpoenaed to go before a grand jury on Friday, but that he was unlikely to appear or to provide documents he was ordered to hand over.He indicated he did not know what the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was seeking by ordering him to appear before the grand jury and to turn over a number of documents. There was no way to authenticate the subpoena; Mr. Mueller’s office declined to comment.But Mr. Nunberg said he was unconcerned about the potential for being arrested. By midafternoon, he had been interviewed on MSNBC and CNN. Fox News soon joined in with coverage.On air, Mr. Nunberg denigrated Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, as a “slob.” Twitter cataloged his insults, mesmerized by his repeat performances. One CNN host asked him if he had been drinking.By evening, Mr. Nunberg told reporters he might comply with Mr. Mueller’s demand after all. Unless he doesn’t, of course.And so it went with Mr. Nunberg, a protégé of the self-described dirty trickster Roger J. Stone Jr., who has been a focus of aspects of the various investigations into possible Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.Part of the subpoena document, which Mr. Nunberg provided to The New York Times, is dated Feb. 27 and makes no mention of requiring him to appear before the grand jury. It calls only for him to preserve documents from Nov. 1, 2015, through the present related to several people connected to the Trump campaign. They include President Trump; the departing White House communications director, Hope Hicks; the former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski; Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist; Mr. Trump’s longtime bodyguard, Keith Schiller; the former Trump Organization lawyer Michael D. Cohen; and Mr. Stone, a longtime confidant of Mr. Trump’s.“They have requested a ridiculous amount of documents,” Mr. Nunberg said. “Should I spend 30 hours producing these? I don’t know what they have. They may very well have something on the president. But they are unfairly targeting Roger Stone.”The subpoena also demands any documents related to Carter Page, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who was secretly surveilled by the Justice Department as part of the Russia investigation, as well as Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman, and his deputy, Rick Gates. Mr. Manafort has been indicted on a string of money laundering and fraud charges, and Mr. Gates recently pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with Mr. Mueller’s investigators.The list of people about whom Mr. Mueller is seeking information from Mr. Nunberg raises questions about his target, as does the time frame. Mr. Nunberg was fired by Mr. Trump during the summer of 2015 and thus was gone from the campaign in November. And he and Mr. Lewandowski are known to be combatants.Still, Mr. Nunberg — whose mentor, Mr. Stone, goes by the motto that all press is good press — spent hours on Monday engaged in a media tour with The Times, The Washington Post, CNN and MSNBC, describing his plans to flout the subpoena and professing his lack of concern about what could happen to him.“I was fired within six weeks” of the campaign’s start, Mr. Nunberg told The Times, despite having “saved” Mr. Trump during a fight with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, that summer after Mr. Trump’s remark that Mr. McCain was not a war hero because he was captured in Vietnam. Mr. McCain was shot down during the war and imprisoned for more than five years in Hanoi, refusing early release even after being beaten repeatedly.Mr. Nunberg added that the president often sounded “like a moron, but this whole thing is a witch hunt.”Mr. Nunberg said he anticipated his lawyer, Patrick J. Brackley, would fire him for speaking publicly. Mr. Brackley did not immediately respond to an email asking whether that was the case.Mr. Nunberg could avoid appearing before the grand jury if his lawyer sent prosecutors a letter asserting his Fifth Amendment rights not to incriminate himself. If that does not happen, Mr. Mueller’s prosecutors could ask a judge for a bench warrant for Mr. Nunberg’s arrest.Mr. Nunberg has spoken with the Senate Intelligence Committee in its own investigation into Russian election meddling, according to a person familiar with the matter. He has not spoken with the House Intelligence Committee, according to three of its members. Its own examination of Moscow interference has languished amid partisan infighting.Mr. Stone, asked for comment, said he was not surprised that his information was being sought.“I was part of the Trump campaign, have been the president’s friend and adviser for decades, and would expect that Mueller’s team would ask for any documents or emails sent or written by me,” Mr. Stone said in a text message. “But let me reiterate, I have no knowledge or involvement in Russian collusion or any other inappropriate act.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/speaker-paul-ryan-trump.html","WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan, a fierce believer in America as a land of immigrants, recently attended a dinner party with a so-called Dreamer. When she pleaded with him to help young undocumented immigrants like herself gain legal status, he hesitated — the House, he said, would pass only legislation that President Trump would sign.He again held back last month after the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee confronted him over their conclusion that Republican aides on the House Intelligence Committee had leaked the private text messages of a senior senator to Fox News. The senators asked for no specific action, and Mr. Ryan offered none.But when Mr. Trump challenged Republican free-trade orthodoxy, Mr. Ryan — a fervent advocate of trade accords for decades — had to respond, albeit four days later and through his press secretary. The speaker, his spokeswoman said, was “extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war” that could be sparked by the president’s steel and aluminum tariffs.On one contentious issue after another — the investigation of Russian interference in American elections, trade, immigration and gun control — a speaker who rose to prominence as an outspoken, almost brash leader, determined to bring his party along with his vision of governance, has receded. Instead, he wields his gavel gingerly.Even on one of his signature issues, free trade, he has mostly worked behind the scenes to change the president’s mind.“I think Ryan’s expectations had to be dramatically reduced when Trump became president,” said Peter Wehner, a onetime adviser to former President George W. Bush who is close to the speaker. “I think in a lot of ways he was forced into a defensive posture rather than an offensive posture.”To supporters like Mr. Wehner, Mr. Ryan’s approach is pure pragmatism and smart politics. Facing a divided Republican conference and a mercurial president of his party, they say, he has little choice but to curb some of his own instincts, work behind the scenes and steer Mr. Trump gently. He also must guide House Republicans into a very difficult midterm election campaign, where his main job is to ensure that vulnerable members get re-elected. And those close to Mr. Ryan note that, with the exception of trade, he has not had serious policy disagreements with the president.But Mr. Ryan had modeled himself as a different kind of leader, the youthful face of a new brand of conservatism that was to broaden his party’s appeal and move it beyond 1980s-style Reaganism. His 2012 run for vice president lifted his national profile and fortified his standing. So to critics, the leader once described as “the intellectual center of Republicans in the House” has abandoned principles to hang onto a job he ostensibly never wanted.“I’m tired of saying deep in his heart there is a different Paul Ryan,” said Charles J. Sykes, a conservative commentator and former radio host in Mr. Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin, who for years promoted Mr. Ryan as a potential presidential candidate.Conservative critiques of Mr. Trump, from senators such as Jeff Flake of Arizona and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have gone beyond policy disagreements, to temperament, defenses of democratic institutions and law enforcement, and the conduct of foreign policy. And other Republican leaders are speaking out. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, is giving almost daily speeches on the Senate floor pushing for action on a modest but bipartisan bill to fortify the existing background check system for gun purchases.Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the chairman of the Finance Committee and a loud supporter of Mr. Trump, nonetheless scorched his tariffs as “a tax hike the American people don’t need and can’t afford.”Mr. Ryan has repeatedly urged Mr. Trump to abandon the tariffs in private, according to one person familiar with their conversations. In public, he has held his tongue. He declined to be interviewed.“I always imagined that there was room for an alternative conservative vision to Trumpism, and Paul Ryan was ideally suited to be that leader of a non-Trumpist conservative Republican Party, but he’s chosen not to assume that role,” Mr. Sykes said. “It’s very disappointing to see he’s become so comfortable as an ally and an enabler of Trump.”For Democrats, the speaker’s deference to Mr. Trump is the stuff of ridicule — and a constitutional dereliction of duty by the man three steps from the presidency.“Can you imagine Tip O’Neill or Sam Rayburn or any of the portraits in this gallery saying, ‘I don’t know whether I can be for that, I’ve got to go down the street and ask permission of the president’?” asked Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, referring to previous speakers whose portraits hang just outside the House chamber.To be sure, Mr. Ryan has had some achievements, notably the rewrite of the federal tax code, which for the speaker marked the realization of a long-held dream. He pushed a repeal of the Affordable Care Act through the House, only to see it die in the Senate. And he helped negotiate a two-year budget deal that should bring some peace to Washington even as it balloons federal spending.“Speaker Ryan has taken on all the challenges of the modern speakership and deftly kept the conference united while advancing an historic conservative agenda,” said Mr. Ryan’s spokeswoman, AshLee Strong. She cited in particular the tax code rewrite and the budget deal’s provisions for “the rebuilding of our depleted military.”Mr. Ryan has not always been so deferential. When Mr. Trump attacked a Mexican-American judge during the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Ryan called the comments the “textbook definition of a racist comment.” When the infamous Access Hollywood tape came out, showing Mr. Trump boasting of sexually assaulting women, Mr. Ryan saw to it that Mr. Trump was disinvited to a rally in Wisconsin.“They’re from entirely different worlds,” Mr. Wehner said. “That said, Ryan knows he has to deal with Trump, and Trump has probably figured out he has to rely on Ryan.”Now 48, Mr. Ryan became the youngest speaker since 1869 when he was elected to the post in the fall of 2015, replacing John A. Boehner, who was effectively pushed out by conservatives in his unruly conference. Mr. Ryan told his colleagues then that he would accept the speakership only if all factions would unite behind him.To a certain extent, he has succeeded.But in the name of unity, he has governed with a light hand. Last month, the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee confronted Mr. Ryan after they concluded that the House Intelligence Committee had leaked a senator’s private texts — a serious breach of protocol. Although the senators raised concerns about the direction of the committee under its chairman, Devin Nunes of California, Mr. Ryan apparently chose not to intervene.“The speaker heard the senators on their concerns and encouraged them to take them up directly with their counterparts,” said his spokeswoman, Ms. Strong.If Mr. Ryan is known for one quality, House Republicans say, it is his willingness to listen. Members of his conference view him as “inclusive and fair,” said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania.But in a chamber where 218 votes are required to pass legislation, Mr. Ryan still faces the same fundamental problem as his predecessor: He has difficulty bringing his fractious conference together. That means he must watch his step.Unlike Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader, who was speaker from 2007 to 2011, he is not a forceful presence in the House chamber. As speaker, Ms. Pelosi ruled the House with an iron fist, guiding dozens of bills large and small into law. She engineered passage of even doomed bills like a climate change bill that died in the Senate — and likely cost Democrats seats in the 2010 Republican landslide. She emerged as the undisputable face of her caucus, to some members’ chagrin.That is not Mr. Ryan’s style.“It’s hard for anyone be a strong speaker in the traditional sense around here because the speaker is only as strong as his conference allows him to be,” Mr. Dent said. “And because on many issues the speaker cannot get 218 Republican votes, that weakens his position.”Apart from the tax overhaul, that has made for narrow legislative proposals. With Republicans under intense pressure to address gun violence after the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., Mr. Ryan swatted away any suggestion last week that the House would take expansive action.The chamber has already adopted a measure to make modest changes to the national instant background check database, coupled with a measure pushed by the gun lobby to expand the reach of concealed weapons permits. The speaker said Republican leaders now are waiting for the Senate to act.“I’m not going to micromanage this,” he said at a news conference.But there are consequences to Mr. Ryan’s low-key style. Big issues like immigration are languishing with no resolution in sight. Causes that were once Mr. Ryan’s signature fights — an exploding budget deficit, soaring Medicare and Social Security spending and an entrenched welfare state — are on nobody’s must-do list. Even Mr. Boehner, never viewed as a policymaking powerhouse, at least tried to negotiate a “grand bargain” with the White House that was to slow entitlement spending, cut other parts of the government and raise revenue to balance the budget.Mr. Ryan’s break with Mr. Trump on trade came only after several other Republicans made clear that they were not standing by the president. Republicans are running for re-election on the strength of the economy, hoping that voters credit their policies, especially the tax cuts. But a trade war marked by a spike in consumer prices could jeopardize their survival strategy.To Representative Brian Mast, Republican of Florida and a combat veteran who lost both his legs in Afghanistan, Mr. Ryan’s suggestion that the House wait for the Senate to act on guns is not good enough after the Parkland slaughter.“If we believe that tax reform is a do-or-die issue that we have to get done but we can’t say that protecting our kids is that same kind of issue, then that’s not leadership,” said Mr. Mast, who backed an assault weapons ban after the bloodshed in Parkland.Conservatives, meanwhile, have put Mr. Ryan on notice that he does not have free rein. Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, was instrumental in the ouster of Mr. Boehner, and he suggested last month that a misstep on immigration in particular could cost Mr. Ryan his job.“I can say that it is a defining moment for this speaker,” Mr. Meadows said then. “If he gets it wrong, it will have consequences for him.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/world/asia/nastya-rybka-trump-putin.html","BANGKOK — A Belarusian escort with close ties to a powerful Russian oligarch said from behind bars in Bangkok on Monday that she had more than 16 hours of audio recordings that could help shed light on Russian meddling in United States elections.The escort, Anastasia Vashukevich, said she would hand over the recordings if the United States  granted her asylum. She faces criminal charges and deportation to Belarus after coming under suspicion of working in Thailand without a visa at a sex-training seminar in the city of Pattaya.Ms. Vashukevich, who described herself as close to the Russian aluminum tycoon Oleg V. Deripaska, said that audio recordings she made in August 2016 included discussions he had about the United States presidential election with people she declined to identify.Mr. Deripaska, a billionaire with close ties to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, also has business ties to Paul J. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman. Mr. Manafort is under investigation by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel looking into the campaign’s connections to Russia.“If America gives me protection, I will tell everything I know,” Ms. Vashukevich said on Monday. “I am afraid to go back to Russia. Some strange things can happen.”Her assertion could be easy to disregard were it not for a 25-minute video investigation posted last month on YouTube by the Russian opposition figure Aleksei A. Navalny, which relies heavily on videos and photographs from Ms. Vashukevich.She and nine people from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus were arrested late last month in Pattaya, a city about 70 miles south of Bangkok known for its adult entertainment scene. Most of those arrested, including Ms. Vashukevich, 21, who also goes by the name Nastya Rybka, are accused of working without a permit. Some are also accused of not having a valid Thai visa.Ms. Vashukevich and Alexander Kirillov, the organizer of the sex seminar, spoke to three reporters while standing behind bars and a mesh screen during visiting hours at the Immigration Detention Center in Bangkok. Immigration officials stopped the interviews midway and told the reporters to leave the facility.Ms. Vashukevich, wearing a bright green T-shirt with the word “detainee” in Thai, is a long way from the days she spent sailing on a yacht with Mr. Deripaska and his friends, including Sergei E. Prikhodko, a deputy prime minister.According to her version of events, she was working for a modeling agency when she and several other models were sent to spend time on Mr. Deripaska’s yacht. She later posted photographs and videos on social media showing Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Prikhodko together on the yacht.Financial records show that companies controlled by Mr. Manafort owed millions of dollars to Mr. Deripaska. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Manafort offered to give Mr. Deripaska private briefings on the campaign.Mr. Navalny charged in his video that Mr. Deripaska’s yacht trip was an attempt to bribe Mr. Prikhodko, and that Ms. Vashukevich was one of “several” prostitutes aboard the vessel. In the video, the tycoon and Mr. Prikhodko can be heard discussing Russian-American relations. The video also highlights a book Ms. Vashukevich wrote titled “Who Wants to Seduce a Billionaire.”Russia has tried to block Mr. Navalny’s video, which had nearly 6.4 million views on YouTube as of Monday. A spokesman for Mr. Deripaska has said the allegations of bribery and prostitutes on the yacht were a “hot story that appears far from being the truth.”In the interview at the immigration center on Monday, Ms. Vashukevich said that she had often recorded conversations between Mr. Deripaska and his associates, and that she had 16 to 18 hours of recordings, including conversations about the United States presidential election.“They were discussing elections,” she said. “Deripaska had a plan about elections.”But, she added, “I can’t tell you everything.”Some of the conversations were with three people who spoke English fluently and who she thought were Americans, she said.“It is not only about me,” she said. “It concerns a lot of people in America and other countries.”Ms. Vashukevich and Mr. Kirillov, who also goes by the name Alex Lesley, are prominent on social media and are considered by some to be publicity seekers.Ms. Vashukevich took part in a small protest in Moscow last year defending Harvey Weinstein after he faced numerous accusations of sexual abuse. Standing mostly naked near the American Embassy, she and four other women held signs with slogans such as “Hands Off Harvey” and “Harvey Weinstein Welcome to Russia.”Ms. Vashukevich said she arrived in Thailand on Feb. 16, and that she was only an observer at the sex seminar but did not work at the event.Several attendees said that no sex had been involved, and that the multiday training had focused on improving communication and on perfecting the art of seduction.Those who are taken to the immigration detention center are often on the verge of being deported. But an immigration official said that Ms. Vashukevich and five others taken to the center still faced criminal charges for their part in the seminar. They will be sent back to Pattaya for court proceedings.Ms. Vashukevich described being held in a crowded cell with more than 100 women and only three toilets. She said a Thai official had asked her to sign a paper saying that she believed she would be safe in Russia, but that she had refused.In general, people seeking asylum must apply in the country where they hope to take refuge.A spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Bangkok said she was aware of the arrests but declined to discuss the case or any asylum request.Mr. Kirillov said that he believed publicity would help protect them. “I think the press makes us a little bit safer because if they killed us in the prison, everyone would know,” he said.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/old-death-row-executions-supreme-court.html","WASHINGTON — The nation’s death rows are starting to look like geriatric wards. Condemned inmates in many states are more likely to die of natural causes than to be executed. The rare ones who are put to death often first spend decades behind bars, waiting.It turns out that executing old men is not easy. In November, Ohio called off an attempt to execute Alva Campbell, 69, after the execution team could not find a suitable vein into which to pump lethal chemicals. The state announced that it would try again in June 2019, by which time he would have been 71.But Mr. Campbell suffered from what one judge called an “extraordinary list of ailments.” He used a walker, could barely breathe and relied on a colostomy bag. He was found lifeless in his cell on Saturday, having died in the usual way, without government assistance.In Alabama last month, state officials called off the execution of Doyle Lee Hamm, 61, also because they could not find a suitable vein. Mr. Hamm has at least two kinds of cancer, cranial and lymphatic, and he may not have long to live with or without the state’s efforts.Last week, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of another Alabama inmate, Vernon Madison, 67, who suffers from dementia and cannot remember the crime that sent him to death row. The court, which has barred the execution of juvenile offenders and the intellectually disabled, is now turning its attention to old people.In 1985, Mr. Madison killed a police officer, Julius Schulte, who had been trying to keep the peace between Mr. Madison and his ex-girlfriend, Cheryl Greene, as she sought to eject him from what had been their shared home. Mr. Madison shot Ms. Greene, too, wounding her.Mr. Madison remembers none of this. He has suffered at least two severe strokes, and he is blind and incontinent. His speech is slurred, and what he says does not always make sense.He has asked that his mother be told of his strokes, but his mother is dead. He soils himself, saying “no one will let me out to use the bathroom,” though there is a toilet in his cell. He says he plans to move to Florida. He can recite the alphabet, but only to the letter G.Mr. Madison also insists that he “never went around killing folks.”A court-appointed psychologist found that Mr. Madison had “significant body and cognitive decline as a result of strokes.” But the psychologist testified that Mr. Madison understood what he was accused of and how the state planned to punish him. According to Steve Marshall, Alabama’s attorney general, that is enough.The Supreme Court’s precedents bar the execution of people who lack a “rational understanding” of the reason they are to be put to death.Mr. Marshall told the justices that Mr. Madison satisfied that standard. “The ability to form a rational understanding of an event,” he wrote in January in a brief urging the justices to stay out of the case, “has very limited relation to whether a person remembers that event.”Mr. Madison’s case, which has been bouncing around the court system for more than 30 years, has taken some unusual turns.His first conviction was reversed because prosecutors violated the Constitution by excluding all seven potential jurors who were black. His second conviction was thrown out after prosecutors committed misconduct by using expert testimony to tell the jury about evidence never properly introduced.At Mr. Madison’s third trial, the jury voted to sentence him to life in prison. But Judge Ferrill D. McRae, of Mobile County Circuit Court, overrode that verdict and sentenced Mr. Madison to death.I interviewed Judge McRae in 2011, not long before he died. I had sought him out because he had achieved a rare distinction. He had overridden six jury verdicts calling for life sentences, a state record, while never rejecting a jury’s recommendation of death.Alabama juries are not notably squeamish about the death penalty, but Judge McRae said they needed to be corrected when they were seized by an impulse toward mercy. “If you didn’t have something like that,” he said of judicial overrides, “a jury with no experience in other cases would be making the ultimate decision, based on nothing.”Alabama abolished judicial overrides last year.In 2016, Mr. Madison came very close to being put to death. A deadlocked eight-member Supreme Court refused to vacate a stay of execution issued by a federal appeals court, with the court’s four conservative members saying they would have let the execution proceed. Justice Antonin Scalia had died a few months before, leaving the Supreme Court short-handed. Had Justice Scalia lived, Mr. Madison would almost certainly be dead by now.The case took some additional procedural twists, and Mr. Madison returned to the Supreme Court in January after a state court again ruled against him. The Supreme Court stayed his execution, though the court’s three most conservative members — Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch — said they would have let it go forward.The case, Madison v. Alabama, No. 17-7505, will be argued in the fall, and it will give the court a chance to consider some profound questions.“Mr. Madison is one among a growing number of aging prisoners who remain on death row in this country for ever longer periods of time,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote in a concurring opinion when the court considered an earlier appeal. “Given this trend, we may face ever more instances of state efforts to execute prisoners suffering the diseases and infirmities of old age.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/us/politics/trump-nuclear-russia-containment.html","WASHINGTON — Just hours after President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia boasted last week about producing “invincible” new nuclear arms designed to evade American missile defenses, President Trump’s nominee to command the nation’s military cyberunits was being grilled at a Senate confirmation hearing about another vexing Russian threat.Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone, the nominee to run the National Security Agency and United States Cyber Command, acknowledged that plans were in place to strike back at Moscow for its election hacking. Those actions would require Mr. Trump’s approval.But General Nakasone said the Russians, as well as America’s other adversaries in cyberspace, seem unimpressed.“I would say right now they do not think much will happen to them,” he said. “They don’t fear us.”The Russian muscle-flexing and the American hand-wringing captured a strategic vacuum that now envelops Washington as Mr. Putin pursues what he views as a complementary new-generation nuclear arsenal, as well as cyberweapons.By comparison, the United States is still uncertain how to make use of its cyberweapons after spending billions of dollars to build an arsenal. It is concerned that the Russians — along with the Chinese, the Iranians and the North Koreans — could easily retaliate against any attack, striking American banks, utilities, stock markets and communications networks.And in the nuclear sphere, the Trump administration has yet to offer a strategy to contain or deter Russia beyond simply matching the weapons buildup. Mr. Trump himself has largely remained silent about his vision to contain Russian power, and has not expressed hope of luring Moscow into new rounds of negotiations to prevent a recurrent arms race.The threat that Russia poses on both fronts has helped push the United States to declare a fundamental shift on national security: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis asserted in January that “great power competition,” not terrorism, is now the primary American focus.Washington’s response — at least in the nuclear realm — also harks back to the Cold War era: a cycle of move and countermove. This time, however, it involves not just building larger stockpiles, but also developing new types of weapons of greater sophistication, matched with more advanced missile defenses.“Putin has become the best friend of the U.S. nuclear arms industry,” said nonproliferation expert Gary Samore. He negotiated with the Russians during the Clinton administration, when optimism ran high that the era of nuclear competition was over, and again during the Obama administration, after Mr. Putin had begun Moscow’s current nuclear modernization.The Pentagon believes that many of the new plans that Mr. Putin announced last week to bolster his arsenal — including undersea nuclear torpedoes, nuclear cruise missiles and other new weapons — are years away from deployment. He has called his new missiles “invincible,” as some can evade missile defenses, and started a contest to name them.Mr. Putin has blamed the United States’ failure to embrace past arms control treaties as the reason for his buildup. But he has particularly complained about American nuclear defenses, which he said were aimed as much at Russia as they were at North Korea. American officials have said that is a wild misstatement of the technology’s reach.In his State of the Union speech in January, Mr. Trump demanded that Congress “modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal.” That was followed in February by the administration’s Nuclear Posture Review, which was more specific. It called for new, low-yield nuclear weapons that it justified on the basis of recent Russian advances. It also described in detail a once top-secret Russian autonomous nuclear torpedo that is designed to cross the Pacific.Additionally, the nuclear review abandoned earlier promises by the Obama administration that nuclear weapons would be a diminishing part of American security and defense. “Past assumptions that our capability to produce nuclear weapons would not be necessary and that we could permit the required infrastructure to age into obsolescence have proven to be mistaken,” the document said.Drafts of a new missile defense strategy, which may be published later this month, include suggestions that the program may now turn to developing missile defenses against Russia and China, not just countering states like North Korea with smaller arsenals.“We must no longer think in terms of building just ‘limited’ missile defense capabilities,” concluded a report that was issued last year by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. “The United States should begin the journey to develop a next-generation missile defense.”It called for pursuing a “space-based kill layer” that would try to shoot down swarms of enemy warheads and missiles — a step that would go beyond the Reagan administration’s “Star Wars” research on space arms and no doubt prompt new rounds of reaction from Mr. Putin and the Russian military.Particularly striking is the absence of much interest in Washington or Moscow for arms control talks.From President John F. Kennedy’s time in office through President Barack Obama’s, new treaties were negotiated that first limited atmospheric testing, then the numbers of weapons that could be deployed. The result was an 85 percent decline in the number of nuclear weapons in the world.But the most recent arms reduction treaty, called New Start, expires in early 2021. Mr. Trump has not expressed interest in renewing it. And there is evidence that even before its scheduled sunset, expensive new cycles of technological action and reaction are beginning to take shape.Over the past few months, most talk of restraint has been cast to the wind as Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump take steps to rebuild their arsenals, according to arms control advocates. Doing so portends a new generation of nuclear weapons, as such moves and countermoves create a rationale for building more.Lisbeth Gronlund, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, based in Cambridge, Mass., said Mr. Putin’s announcement last week “further ratchets up what is clearly a new arms race, making the world a more dangerous place.”But what worries veterans of that Cold War is less the new technology than the old rhetoric.“None of this changes the fundamental picture of what the U.S. and Russia do to each other,” Matthew Bunn, a Harvard professor who is one of the directors of the Managing the Atom project, told a group of journalists at the Nieman Foundation in Cambridge on Friday.He said what is changing “is the degree of tension” that revives the dangers of miscalculations that could lead to military action — the great fear at the height of the Cold War during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.The cyberchallenge is the newest one, and thus is not captive to the strategies of past generations. But in public statements in recent weeks, Mr. Trump’s top intelligence officials have conceded that the president has yet to discuss strategies with them to prevent the Russians from interfering in the midterm elections this year. Mr. Trump has expressed severe doubts that the Russians meddled in 2016, contradicting the conclusions of his intelligence officials.Two days before General Nakasone’s hearing last week, the man he would replace at the N.S.A. and Cyber Command — Adm. Michael S. Rogers — offered striking testimony in what is likely to be his last public appearance on Capitol Hill before leaving office.Four years ago, after he took command, Admiral Rogers said one of his goals was to assure that American adversaries would “pay a price” for their cyberactions against the United States that “will far outweigh the benefit” derived from hacking. He also frequently said that the retaliation might not necessarily be a counter-cyberstrike, but could involve economic sanctions or diplomatic isolation.However, last week Admiral Rogers conceded that his own test had not been met.Pressed about what pressure he had put on the Russians, he said: “We’re taking steps, but we’re probably not doing enough.” He also dismissed sanctions that Congress approved last year — and that Mr. Trump has failed to impose — as insufficient to change “the calculus or the behavior” of Mr. Putin.At General Nakasone’s confirmation hearing two days later, Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, said that “the problem is not technical,” but political, given the United States’ impressive cyberarsenal.“We are not responding in any way that’s adequate to the challenge we face,” Mr. Sasse said.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/us/politics/trump-trade-tariffs-peter-navarro-wilbur-ross.html","WASHINGTON — The White House continued to sow uncertainty on Sunday about the stiff tariffs President Trump said he would impose on steel and aluminum imports as key advisers defended the policy but left room for the president to change his plans.Peter Navarro, an adviser and the architect of many of Mr. Trump’s campaign trade promises, confirmed on Sunday that the president would not exclude any country from the tariffs but said individual companies could apply for exemptions for certain products.Mr. Trump, meanwhile, engaged in a weekend-long tweet storm defending his policies and saying the United States had been on the “losing side” of global trade deals for too long.“We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday night. “Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry, it’s time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”Mr. Trump rattled stock markets last week with his impromptu announcement that he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports and as business executives said the president would make no country exceptions.“As soon as he starts exempting countries, he has to raise the tariff on everybody else,” Mr. Navarro said on “Fox News Sunday.” “As soon as he exempts one country, his phone starts ringing from the heads of state of other countries.”But Mr. Navarro left room for change in the timing of the tariffs, which the president said would be signed this week. “Toward the end of the week,” Mr. Navarro said in a separate appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” when asked when the tariffs would be announced. “At the latest, it would be the following week.”Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, also appeared to leave room for the president to change his mind.“Whatever his final decision is, is what will happen,” Mr. Ross said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “What he has said he has said. If he says something different, it’ll be something different.”“If he for some reason should change his mind, then it will change,” Mr. Ross added, noting that he had no reason to believe that the president would do so.That followed similar equivocation by Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, who was asked on Friday whether Mr. Trump was committed to the tariffs he announced in a hastily arranged meeting on Thursday. “Never say never, but I think he’s pretty committed to moving this forward,” she said.The announcement of tariffs on Thursday capped off a chaotic week at the White House, which has been bedeviled by staff departures and fierce disputes over policy. Some top White House staff were unaware the president was going to roll out these tariffs until he did so on national television.Mr. Navarro and Mr. Ross have been among the staunchest defenders of the trade action, which would hit global trading partners like Canada and South Korea much more than China, which the administration has described as the primary culprit in putting American metal makers out of business. Both men backed the tariffs, saying the benefits to American metal makers would be considerable and the costs to industries that use those metals in their products — like automakers and food packagers — negligible.Mr. Ross described the effect of the tariff as “a fraction of a penny on a can of beer.” Mr. Navarro clashed with Chris Wallace of Fox News, who tried to get the economic adviser to admit that those costs, when multiplied by all products that use steel and aluminum over the entire economy, would escalate into the billions of dollars. Mr. Navarro said he saw the costs as “insignificant” in the mission to preserve the steel and aluminum industries, which have seen factories pick up and move from the United States to cheaper parts of the world.The White House’s plan continued to face fierce criticism, including from Republicans who believe free trade is in the interest of the economy.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, criticized the tariffs for falling more heavily on American allies than on China, which he said had earlier flooded the global market with steel.Economists say the tariffs, if applied without exceptions, would harm allies like Canada, South Korea and the European Union, which export more steel to the United States than China does. Shortly after the tariffs were announced, the European Union responded by saying that it was already preparing to levy retaliatory tariffs on American products, including orange juice, bluejeans and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.“You’re letting China off the hook,” Mr. Graham said on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “China wins when we fight with Europe.”Joshua B. Bolten, the head of the Business Roundtable and chief of staff in the George W. Bush administration, called the tariffs “a huge mistake.”Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” Mr. Bolten acknowledged that the president was trying to fulfill his campaign promises and help American workers in the steel and aluminum industries. But Mr. Bolten said the tariffs would cause “huge damage across broad sectors of the economy” that use steel and aluminum in their products, or that face retaliation from angry trading partners.That did not dissuade Mr. Navarro, who doubled down on comments he made on Friday arguing that trading partners would not retaliate against the United States because they fear losing access to the valuable American market.“All we are asking for is fair and reciprocal trade,” Mr. Navarro said on “Fox News Sunday.” “What we need to do here is keep the rhetoric down.”Since the announcement, the president has only ratcheted up his language on trade, tweeting several times about trade policy and the disadvantage he believes the United States faces. He criticized past trade policy, threatened to levy a tax on countries that retaliated against the tariffs and called for rebuilding the steel industry.“When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,” he tweeted on Saturday.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/us/politics/kellyanne-conway-white-house.html","WASHINGTON — A year ago, few “on the outside” — a phrase perhaps tellingly favored in the Trump White House — would have guessed that Kellyanne Conway would be the one hanging on as other high-profile aides pull their rip cords.A year ago, Ms. Conway, the president’s counselor, told Americans of the fictional “Bowling Green massacre,” drawing ridicule from cable TV hosts and liberal critics. She declared that the White House was merely presenting “alternative facts” when it described an inauguration crowd in superlatives that did not comport with reality. She was painted into an unhinged “Saturday Night Live” caricature. For a pollster with a long history of working well with the news media, the attacks were jarring, according to her allies.But in this White House, a lot can change in a year.More than a dozen high-profile departures later — and amid tumult, scandal and an ever-unfolding investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia — Ms. Conway, 51, is one of the few remaining prominent aides from the campaign. In a White House with the highest turnover rates in decades, she has survived by knowing when to step back from the spotlight, keeping the president’s ear, focusing on a policy issue significant to the poor and working class, and maintaining an unflinching loyalty to President Trump even as she outmaneuvers rivals on the staff.The public criticism hasn’t abated, but Ms. Conway’s skin is thicker than it used to be.“I don’t respond to or read 99 percent of it,” Ms. Conway said in a brief interview on Saturday, “because it is so reflexive and unthoughtful.”She couldn’t resist adding a half-jab, half-joke: “I do wonder what everybody is so miserable about.”Alongside aides including Hope Hicks, who said last week that she would depart her role as White House communications director, Ms. Conway ran the campaign through its stormy final days, and then followed her candidate to the White House. In those early months, in an act born of savvy or necessity, Ms. Conway stepped back from the media glare to focus on demonstrating to her colleagues and her critics that she was as capable on policy as she was sparring with talking heads on TV.Her choice seems to have paid off.“She has this unique position that she’s earned,” said former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who worked closely on the opioid crisis with Ms. Conway and credited her with urging the president to personalize the issue through his brother’s experience with addiction. “She’s gotten a bad rap at times, but I think that’s because of some of the really awful people inside the White House who have been trying to hurt her, as opposed to anything the press came up with on its own.”In recent months, Ms. Conway has watched, somewhat from the sidelines, as John F. Kelly, the president’s current chief of staff, came in and pledged to bring order to the West Wing, dispatching a number of aides who had once envied the access Ms. Conway cultivated with the president.“He came around and wanted to know what everyone had been working on for the first six months,” Ms. Conway said, “and some of us were just better equipped to handle that question than others.”For the president, Ms. Conway, an outspoken opponent of abortion, is one of his most prominent ties to the conservative movement.Representative Mark Meadows, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said Ms. Conway had been wise to engage in public appearances only “at times when the president has asked her to engage.”“It’s not about Kellyanne,” he said. “It’s about the president of the United States and this country.”Mr. Meadows added: “The limelight is not the primary concern for getting her agenda done, and I think that has served her well.”She has told allies in and outside the West Wing that her respect is not just for the president, but the presidency as an institution. Still, one of her biggest strengths, those who know her say, is that she has always understood whom she works for. Loyalty to her clients always came easily, but this time, her client just happens to be in the Oval Office.“I think that she is the president’s political adviser and she is someone who is very skilled on television,” Mr. Christie said. “She’s unique in the White House in someone who can give him both political and policy advice.”Mr. Christie said that, early on, this prompted other aides to target her. A friend of Ms. Conway’s, who didn’t want to be identified because of the social opprobrium she would face as a Democrat, said Ms. Conway had particularly struggled with Reince Priebus, the president’s former chief of staff, during the first chaotic months of the administration. She also survived efforts to curtail her influence by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, who for months privately bristled over Ms. Conway’s getting credit for the campaign victory.But, that friend said, she learned that if her colleagues did not take her seriously, she could use it to her advantage. She kept her head down while other aides burned out, and kept her access to the president.In fact, her portfolio has grown, with the addition of the opioid crisis and coordination with cabinet secretaries, which originally fell under Mr. Kushner’s purview. On Thursday, she put together an opioid summit meeting with cabinet members at the White House, which the president briefly joined.Other Republicans say her loyalty to Mr. Trump — and thus her ability to survive in his chaotic White House — is no virtue.“She has no shame,” Tim Miller, a former spokesman for Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, said in a text message, “and that is a quality the president values.”Ms. Conway, of course, would see it differently. She refers to those who have lasted from the campaign until now as “unbroken threads.”She was not originally part of the campaign, but her friends say she has known the president for more than a decade, and has come to understand him and how to speak with him in ways few aides do outside of Ms. Hicks and Keith Schiller, Mr. Trump’s longtime bodyguard, who left the White House last year. For a president hit by crosscurrents on policy, Ms. Conway has frequently been a voice reminding him of his campaign promises.She has called supporters from the final days of the Trump campaign members of the “October 8th coalition,” for defending Mr. Trump after audio of him bragging about sexual assault had leaked.A mother of four who moved her family to Washington last year, Ms. Conway has faced near-constant attack for defending Mr. Trump’s track record with women. But she has also willingly stepped into battle, including when she criticized women for joining the Women’s March the day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration last year.“I frankly didn’t see the point,” Ms. Conway said at the time.But she and her allies say the attacks against her often have a sexist undertone. And she has bristled at a line of thought in liberal spheres and on social media that she and other women have advanced in the White House by keeping their heads down in a misogynistic workplace.“President Trump is more kind, open, gracious and respectful to the women in the White House than the so-called pro-women movement that criticizes everything from what we wear to what we say to what we believe,” Ms. Conway said. “I wouldn’t work there if he weren’t open to my opinion. It would literally make zero sense for me to be there.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/world/europe/state-department-russia-global-engagement-center.html","WASHINGTON — As Russia’s virtual war against the United States continues unabated with the midterm elections approaching, the State Department has yet to spend any of the $120 million it has been allocated since late 2016 to counter foreign efforts to meddle in elections or sow distrust in democracy.As a result, not one of the 23 analysts working in the department’s Global Engagement Center — which has been tasked with countering Moscow’s disinformation campaign — speaks Russian, and a department hiring freeze has hindered efforts to recruit the computer experts needed to track the Russian efforts.The delay is just one symptom of the largely passive response to the Russian interference by President Trump, who has made little if any public effort to rally the nation to confront Moscow and defend democratic institutions. More broadly, the funding lag reflects a deep lack of confidence by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson in his department’s ability to execute its historically wide-ranging mission and spend its money wisely.Mr. Tillerson has voiced skepticism that the United States is even capable of doing anything to counter the Russian threat.“If it’s their intention to interfere, they’re going to find ways to do that,” Mr. Tillerson said in an interview last month with Fox News. “And we can take steps we can take, but this is something that once they decide they are going to do it, it’s very difficult to pre-empt it.”The United States spends billions of dollars on secret cybercapabilities, but these weapons have proved largely ineffective against Russian efforts on Facebook, Twitter and elsewhere that simply amplify or distort divisive but genuine voices in the United States and elsewhere.The role for the Global Engagement Center would be to assess Russian efforts and then set about amplifying a different set of voices to counter them, perhaps creating a network of anti-propaganda projects dispersed around the world, experts said.“There are now thousands of former Russian journalists who have been exiled or fired who are doing counter-Russian stuff in exile who we could help,” said Richard Stengel, who as the under secretary for public diplomacy in the Obama administration had oversight of the Global Engagement Center.Concerted campaigns to highlight the roles of Russian troll farms or Russian mercenaries in Ukraine and Syria could have a profound effect, Mr. Stengel said.At the end of the Obama administration, Congress directed the Pentagon to send $60 million to the State Department so it could coordinate governmentwide efforts, including those by the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security, to counter anti-democratic propaganda by Russia and China. This messaging effort is separate from other potential government actions like cyberattacks.Mr. Tillerson spent seven months trying to decide whether to spend any of the money. The State Department finally sent a request to the Defense Department on Sept. 18 to transfer the funds, but with just days left in the fiscal year, Pentagon officials decided that the State Department had lost its shot at the money.With another $60 million available for the next fiscal year, the two departments dickered for another five months over how much the State Department could have.After The New York Times, following a report on the issue by Politico in August, began asking about the delayed money, the State Department announced on Monday that the Pentagon had agreed to transfer $40 million for the effort, just a third of what was originally intended.State Department officials say they expect to receive the money in April. Steve Goldstein, the under secretary for public diplomacy, said he would contribute $1 million from his own budget to “kick-start the initiative quickly.”“This funding is critical to ensuring that we continue an aggressive response to malign influence and disinformation,” Mr. Goldstein said.On Wednesday, Mark E. Mitchell, a top official in the Defense Department, said much wrangling remained before any of the promised $40 million is transferred to the State Department.“We’re still a ways off,” Mr. Mitchell said.The delays have infuriated some members of Congress, which approved the funding transfer with bipartisan support.“It is well past time that the State Department’s Global Engagement Center gets the resources Congress intended for it to effectively fight Kremlin-sponsored disinformation and other foreign propaganda operations,” Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said on Wednesday.Adele Ruppe, the center’s chief of staff, defended the administration’s broader efforts to counter Russian propaganda, pointing out that the State Department had provided $1.3 billion in assistance in 2017 to strengthen European resilience to Russian meddling. But that money was largely obligated during the Obama administration, and the Trump administration has proposed slashing that assistance by more than half for the coming year, to $527 million, and to $491 million for the next year.While it waits for the funding transfer from the Pentagon, the center, which has a staff of around 60 people, including 23 contract analysts, will continue working on its original mission: countering jihadist and extremist propaganda.Most of the center’s leaders are working in temporary assignments, a product of Mr. Tillerson’s halt in promotions. The analysts work in a warren of cubicles in the basement of a tired building that once housed the Office of Strategic Services, the World War II predecessor to the C.I.A.The analysts are divided into five teams that largely work in four languages: Arabic, Urdu, French and Somali. The analysts said in interviews that they had notched some significant victories, including a video montage proving that the Islamic State had itself destroyed Al Nuri Grand Mosque in Mosul, Iraq, and a widely seen cartoon in French depicting the miserable life of an Islamic State fighter.Still, these efforts are a small fraction of what Congress envisioned. A 2015 internal assessment found that the Islamic State had been far more nimble on social media than the United States had been. In May, Congress more than doubled the center’s budget, providing an additional $19 million over its earlier budget of $14 million. But by Jan. 1, the department had spent just $3.6 million of the additional $19 million, Mr. Goldstein said.James K. Glassman, the under secretary for public diplomacy during the George W. Bush administration, said the center’s uncertain funding and temporary leadership reflected the administration’s lack of interest in countering either jihadist or Russian propaganda.“They’ve got the vehicle to do this work in the center,” Mr. Glassman said. “What they don’t have is a secretary of state or a president who’s interested in doing this work.”Mr. Tillerson is focusing his energies instead on drastically shrinking the department, leaving a significant part of its budget unused and hundreds of important decisions unmade.Last year, the State Department spent just 79 percent of the money that Congress had authorized for the conduct of foreign affairs, the lowest such level in at least 15 years and well down from the 93 percent spent in the final year of the Obama administration, according to an analysis of data from the Office of Management and Budget.Because of the hiring and promotion freezes that have left large sums unspent, as well as Mr. Tillerson’s refusal to delegate spending decisions, the department had a backlog of more than 1,400 official requests for Mr. Tillerson’s signoff at the end of last year, according to a former senior diplomat who left the department then.
                Eric Schmitt, David E. Sanger and Adam Goldman contributed reporting.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/06/591039154/5-laws-of-political-gravity-in-midterms-do-they-still-apply-in-the-age-of-trump","The 2018 election cycle has officially begun, with the first primaries being held in Texas on Tuesday.In every campaign cycle, analysts look at the fundamentals — the political laws of gravity that, in the past, have influenced elections. In 2016, Donald Trump seemed to defy a lot of these laws, and Republicans are hoping they can do the same this year to prevent the hit the party in power usually takes at this point in a president's first midterm.Here are five laws of political gravity to watch as the 2018 campaign plays out:1. When a president's approval rating is below 50 percent, his party doesn't fare well at allHistorically, parties that hold the White House lose seats in midterms — even more when they also have complete control of Congress, and even more when the president's approval rating is under 50 percent.The Republican Party has a bad news trifecta here.Since the Great Depression, when a president's approval rating has been below 50 percent in his first midterm, his party has lost an average of 41 House and five Senate seats.Midterms are a referendum on the president and his party. Trump is still popular with his base, but because he's so historically unpopular with so many other voters his ability to help his fellow Republicans is diminished. His ""strongly disapprove"" numbers have been consistently higher than his ""strongly approve"" numbers.The latest tracking poll from Gallup showed that 39 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing, while 55 percent disapprove. And his approval rating in the RealClearPolitics average is a similar 40 percent approve, 56 percent disapprove.2. The party with the intensity and enthusiasm on its side winsDemocrats have it — and it's fueled by animus toward President Trump, just like Republicans in 2010 and 2014 were motivated by antipathy to President Obama. (Democrats lost a total of 76 House seats and 15 Senate seats in those two Obama-era midterms.)In the handful of special elections since 2016, and in the Virginia and New Jersey 2017 elections, Democratic turnout has been up. There are hundreds of new Democratic candidates running in races where Democrats have failed to field a candidate in the past, and polls consistently show that Democrats are more interested and enthusiastic about the 2018 campaign than Republicans.As the Washington Post noted Saturday, about 1,200 candidates had registered to run as Democrats for the House by the end of 2017 — a clear record for a single party and the first time since before the wave election of 2010 that Democrats outnumbered Republicans at the same point in an election cycle.3. When people are in a bad mood, the party in power suffersVoters' attitudes about the state of the country — Are we in a recession? Are we at war? — is always one of the most important factors.Americans remain pessimistic about the direction of the country. On average, just 35 percent think the country is headed in the right direction, while 56 percent think it is on the wrong track.And this year, the measurement isn't working the way it usually does in at least one big respect. The direction of the country and a president's approval rating is typically tied to voters' views about the economy. But right now, the economy is doing pretty well — with Americans' attitudes about the economy reaching a 17-year high in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll — and increasing numbers of people are saying they like the GOP tax cuts.So why isn't Trump more popular? In fact, he's suffering poor approval ratings with the very upper-middle class, suburban voters who are probably benefiting the most from his tax cuts.Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report said that it's as if voters are saying to the president, ""Yeah, we feel good about the economy, but we don't really feel good about you.""There is a wild card on the economy — Trump's threatened tariffs and a possible trade war. On Monday, the president said that he didn't think there would be a trade war if he goes ahead with steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, but a few days earlier he tweeted that ""trade wars are good, and easy to win.""Republicans worry Trump's tariffs could undermine the stock market and economic growth — two factors they're counting on to help them in November.4. The party that has the structural advantages can sometimes mitigate damageThis is the bright spot for Republicans.Even though many Democratic candidates have raised impressive amounts of money to stock their war chests, Republicans have a lot more outside money than Democrats do. The Koch Brothers alone have pledged to spend a whopping $400 million electing Republicans this year, 60 percent more than they spent in the 2016 presidential election.Many GOP congressional districts are also drawn to protect incumbents, and because Republicans control more state legislatures, they have overwhelmingly drawn those districts to advantage their party.Republicans are hoping the mighty fortress of redistricting will help them defend against a big blue wave — if one materializes. They are trying to fight back against a state court ruling in Pennsylvania that redrew the state's congressional district and is likely to eat into the GOP's 13-to-5 statewide advantage in House seats. But challenges to maps drawn by Republicans in Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan and North Carolina are unlikely to impact the 2018 election.5. The party that turns out their base usually winsWho actually comes out to vote is an important factor in any election — and it's hard to predict. But it's especially true in midterms, when activists traditionally dominate. Consider: There is about a 30 percent drop off in turnout from presidential to midterm years.In 2016, Donald Trump surprised a lot of political handicappers when he got more rural, white, working-class voters to the polls than most turnout models predicted. And things are often favorable for the GOP in a midterm.""The people who turn out the most tend to be older people, tend to be whiter people, tend to be people who are married, and tend to be people who are well educated,"" says demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution. ""Most of them tend to favor the Republicans.""But there's one flaw in that profile for Republicans — highly educated voters generally do not like Trump. In fact, more than half of white college graduates have strongly disapproved of him. And, since 2016, they have been turning out for Democrats.This will make it harder for Trump to help Republican candidates in the kind of suburban districts won by Hilary Clinton in 2016. The suburbs are precisely where Democrats are hoping to build their comeback. Clinton won 23 districts where a Republican was elected to the House in 2016. Democrats need to pick up a net of 24 seats to take back the House.What's more, Trump won independents in 2016, but they've flipped.To make up for it, Trump needs to turn out big numbers of his white, non-college-educated supporters to the polls this year — just like he did when he defied the odds two years ago.""Coalitions that are built in presidential elections don't always translate into midterm elections,"" Walter points out. ""Just ask Democrats who were counting on the Obama coalition of 2008 to come out in 2010. They didn't."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/591001865/ex-trump-campaign-aide-vows-to-fight-mueller-subpoena-in-tv-tirades","Updated on March 6 at 11:45 a.m. ETA former campaign aide to Donald Trump appears to have changed his mind and will not fight a subpoena he says he has received in the Russia investigation — after daring special counsel Robert Mueller to arrest him in multiple media appearances.Sam Nunberg called reporters and TV news programs on Monday and said live that he'd gotten a grand jury subpoena as part of Mueller's investigation asking for communications with other people in the Trump orbit — but that he won't comply.""Let him arrest me,"" Nunberg told The Washington Post. ""Mr. Mueller should understand I am not going in.""Nunberg then went on multiple MSNBC and CNN shows to publicize his refusal to comply with the Mueller probe. He said he had been summoned to appear before a grand jury on Friday but would not, nor would he produce evidence.What followed was a rambling, at-times incoherent series of exchanges as Nunberg asked for legal advice, opined about whether Trump colluded with Russia, and relitigated an internal Trump campaign power struggle from 2015 — all live, on the air, in real time.""I think that [Trump] may have done something during the election,"" Nunberg told MSNBC's Katy Tur, adding later, ""I don't know that for sure.""""I'm not cooperating,"" Nunberg said. ""Arrest me.""Nunberg is a lawyer who has been admitted to the New York state bar after graduating from Touro Law Center on Long Island, N.Y. All the same, he asked for legal advice from various cable news show hosts: ""What do you think Mueller's going to do to me?"" he asked Tur.""Do you think I should cooperate?"" Nunberg asked CNN's Jake Tapper. ""Why do I have to produce every email? I talk to [former Trump advisers] Steve Bannon and Roger Stone eight times a day.""""Sometimes life and special prosecutors are not fair,"" Tapper quipped.Discussing the request from the Muller team in an interview with the Associated Press later on Monday, Nunberg said he was like ""going to end up cooperating with them.""Nunberg also accused former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page of having played a role in the foreign attack on the election.In the Whitewater investigation during the Clinton administration, an Arkansas business associate of Bill Clinton named Susan McDougal spent 18 months in prison for not complying with a grand jury subpoena. McDougal spoke about Nunberg to the Washington Post on Monday, advising him, ""If you don't want to testify, don't go on television and do these teaser interviews."" ""I believe Carter Page was colluding with the Russians,"" Nunberg said on CNN.Page was a junior foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. He traveled to Moscow twice in 2016 and was the subject of surveillance by the U.S. intelligence community. Page stridently denies doing anything wrong.He and Nunberg never overlapped on the Trump campaign. The Trump campaign fired Nunberg in the summer of 2015, when the Trump candidacy was still in its infancy. Business Insider had written about Nunberg's racially charged Facebook posts from years prior, and the nascent political organization jettisoned him.At the time, Nunberg's firing was viewed as part of a broader struggle between Trump aides Corey Lewandowski and Roger Stone. Nunberg decided to relitigate this on Monday.""Corey wanted to push us out. That's the reality. Now Trump loves Corey. I don't know why he does,"" Nunberg said.By December of that year, Nunberg was saying that Trump's campaign was being led in the wrong direction and predicted that Trump would not win the Republican nomination. By March 2016, Nunberg had endorsed Trump opponent Ted Cruz. The drama continued into the summer of 2016, when Trump sued his former aide for $10 million, alleging Nunberg broke his nondisclosure agreement. After a time, that lawsuit was settled."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/590989957/ailing-mississippi-sen-cochran-to-resign-setting-up-2018-special-election","Updated at 6:02 p.m. ETCiting his ailing health, Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., announced he will resign on April 1, setting up a special election this November. ""I regret my health has become an ongoing challenge,"" Cochran said in a statement Monday. ""I intend to fulfill my responsibilities and commitments to the people of Mississippi and the Senate through the completion of the 2018 appropriations cycle, after which I will formally retire from the U.S. Senate.""Cochran, 80, chairs the Appropriations Committee and has been absent from the Senate for long stretches over the past year, and his resignation does not come as a surprise. However, it does mean that both of Mississippi's Senate seats will be on the ballot come November. According to state law, the remainder of Cochran's term, which expires in 2020, will be filled by a nonpartisan special election in conjunction with the regularly scheduled general election. If no candidate, regardless of party, gets 50 percent, it will go to a December runoff. In the meantime, Republican Gov. Phil Bryant will appoint an interim senator. The state's other senator, Republican Roger Wicker, is also up for re-election this year. He drew a primary challenge last week from state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who previously challenged Cochran in a particularly nasty fight in 2014. McDaniel actually topped Cochran in the first primary election, but failed to get a majority. In the runoff, with the help of crossover Democratic and African-American voters, Cochran prevailed. In a statement later Monday, McDaniel left open the possibly of switching from challenging Wicker to the now-open seat, saying that he would ""continue to monitor developments regarding his replacement and the Special Election that will follow.""""While it is certain that Mississippi will have two U.S. Senate races this year, I am currently focused on my campaign against Roger Wicker, but all options remain on the table as we determine the best way to ensure that Mississippi elects conservatives to the United States Senate,"" McDaniel said. Cochran was first elected to the Senate in 1978 — the first Republican elected statewide then in over 100 years — and had previously served three terms in the House. He leaves as the 10th-longest-serving U.S. senator ever. ""It has been a great honor to serve the people of Mississippi and our country.  I've done my best to make decisions in the best interests of our nation, and my beloved state,"" Cochran said in announcing his decision to step aside. ""My top concern has always been my constituents in Mississippi.  My hope is by making this announcement now, a smooth transition can be ensured so their voice will continue to be heard in Washington, D.C.  My efforts, and those of my staff, to assist them will continue and transfer to my successor.""The Jackson Clarion-Ledger noted that Cochran was a well-liked member of the Senate, dubbed ""Gentleman Thad"" by his fellow legislators, and that he was known for his ""quiet stately demeanor"" and often played ""piano to relax in his office."" Time magazine once called him ""The Quiet Persuader"" for his ability to work across the aisle. His perch atop the powerful Appropriations Committee — which he held during the mid-2000s before regaining it again when Republicans took back the Senate in 2014 — also allowed him to direct projects and money back home to Mississippi, including agricultural aid, funding for universities and federal contracts. That ""bringing home the bacon,"" however, drew the ire of fiscal conservatives and was the reason that many of them supported McDaniel in his 2014 primary challenge. But that same influence also proved critical after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, allowing him to steer billions of dollars to the state. ""The federal relief he helped secure is credited with preventing financial and social ruin in Mississippi and Louisiana after the hurricane's destruction,"" the Clarion-Ledger wrote. Former Gov. Haley Barbour wrote in his book America's Greatest Storm that the way Cochran was able to build bipartisan consensus to deliver aid to the devastated states along the Gulf of Mexico helped save Mississippi. ""On the Senate side, Thad Cochran was in charge, and few if any senators were of a mind to question what he wanted to do for the states hit by Katrina,"" Barbour wrote. ""[Cochran] is a quiet, polite gentleman, but he is tough as nails."" "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/590920670/from-fraud-to-individual-right-where-does-the-supreme-court-stand-on-guns","In the aftermath of the deadly Parkland shooting, attention has focused on legislation that could make its way through Congress and the Florida Legislature.But what does the U.S. Supreme Court have to say about gun control? After a couple of important cases nearly a decade ago, the court has, for the most part, turned away cases challenging gun laws.So why the reluctance, what's the history and is the right to bear arms an absolute one?From a ""fraud"" on the American public to an individual rightFor most of American legal history, the consensus was that the right to bear arms was not an individual right, but rather a right for those called to military service, the militia.Former Chief Justice Warren Burger, a conservative, said the idea that there was an individual right to bear arms was ""a fraud."" If he were writing the Bill of Rights now, he said in 1991, ""There wouldn't be any such thing as the Second Amendment.""He declared on PBS that the Second Amendment ""has been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word fraud, on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.""But that all changed with some scholarly work and cases brought by gun rights advocates.In 2008, in District of Columbia v. Heller, the court said there is an individual constitutional right to have a handgun in one's home for self-protection. Two years later, in a second case, the court made clear that its decision applied to the states as well as the federal government.Not an absolute rightThe court has never said, however, that the right to bear arms in this country is absolute.In declaring an individual right to bear arms, the court made clear that there are limitations on that right, just as there are limitations on other constitutional rights.There is a First Amendment right to free speech, but someone can't yell ""fire!"" in a crowded theater. And a person can't parade loudly through a residential area at 2 a.m. either.Similarly, the court said in 2008 that the right to bear arms doesn't bar the government from regulating firearms.The justices specifically said the government can ban firearms for felons or the mentally ill; it can ban guns in sensitive places, like schools and government buildings; and it can impose conditions and qualifications for the commercial sale of guns.In addition, the court also seemed to say that ""particularly dangerous and unusual weapons,"" such as military-style assault weapons, could be prohibited.Why so reluctant?The court has certainly had the opportunity to say more on guns in recent years. But it has turned away numerous gun cases since Heller.Just last month, for example, the court refused to hear a case testing California's 10-day waiting period to buy a gun. Justice Clarence Thomas was the only dissenter, and he accused the court of turning the right to bear arms into a ""disfavored"" constitutional right.Last June, he and Trump-appointed Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented when the court refused to hear a challenge to a general ban on concealed-carry weapons outside the home.And in the years before that, the court refused to hear challenges to bans on assault weapons, bans on weapons for someone who is the subject of a protection order in a domestic dispute, and more.There are two cases the court ruled on recently. One was to uphold a law banning a gun for anyone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Justice Thomas dissented from that one, as did Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in part.In 2014, the court by a 5-to-4 vote upheld a strict ban on the straw purchase of firearms —that is if, for instance, someone has a record of domestic violence and wouldn't be allowed to buy a gun, but a family member or friend buys one for that person.And there's no indication the court is anxious to take up more gun cases anytime soon. There are two possible explanations for this continued refusal to act — (1) that the court believes it laid down guidelines in its 2008 Heller decision and would just as soon stay out of this, and (2) more likely, neither side — those justices who believe that the Constitution allows strict gun laws or those who think that such gun control laws are unconstitutional — is sure it has the votes to prevail if the court takes up these issues.After all, Heller was 5 to 4, with Justice Anthony Kennedy the deciding vote. And it has long been assumed that the caveats in the decision were the price of his vote.There is, of course, a third possible explanation for the failure to take up gun cases: that some justices, especially in light of current circumstances, have evolving views on this subject."

You can barely buy a two-room apartment for less than 2 million shekels. (That's about $577,000).What's any of this got to do with U.S. politics? At a meeting at the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, President Trump told reporters that he had rejected a $1 billion plan to build a new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. Instead, he's going to build one for just $250,000.What a deal!But that's not quite the whole story.What did Trump say?Here's what Trump said in full about the cost of the new embassy with Netanyahu by his side:Trump quickly added: ""Now, it's temporary, but it'll be very nice.""He then boasted: ""$250,000 versus a billion dollars.""Turning to an already laughing Netanyahu, he asked rhetorically, ""Is that good?""What was Trump talking about?We checked it out. Is the United States somehow building ""it,"" as in a permanent embassy, for $250,000?No.Trump was probably conflating two things: a permanent new embassy to be built years from now and a temporary embassy office the U.S. is building inside an existing consular building in Jerusalem to be set up by May, NPR diplomacy correspondent Michele Kelemen and international correspondent Daniel Estrin, based in Jerusalem, report.""Internal modifications to allow the embassy to open in an existing facility in May is anticipated to cost $200,000 to $400,000,"" a State Department official tells Kelemen.As for financing the permanent embassy, The Associated Press reported in late February:In January, Trump chafed at the $1 billion cost of the new U.S. Embassy in London. He canceled a trip to London for a ribbon-cutting because he said it was a ""bad deal.""The U.S. Embassy in London remarkably put out a statement defending itself, as NPR's Frank Langfitt reported."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/06/591077604/netanyahu-details-his-talk-with-trump-on-iran-and-palestinians","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed his Oval Office meeting with President Trump, offering praise for the U.S. leader's knowledge about Iran, but dodging questions over investigations Netanyahu faces back home.The prime minister does not grant many interviews to reporters based in Israel — except to those reporters who travel with him abroad.Between his Oval Office meeting and his keynote address Tuesday before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Netanyahu sat with a couple dozen reporters at a large round table Monday in the president's official guest house across the street from the White House, and took questions.Back in Israel, Netanyahu and his spokespeople have given up most traditional media interviews in favor of Facebook missives and videos. But on trips abroad, the prime minister tends to brief Israeli journalists and Israel-based international reporters who travel with him. On his trip this week to Washington, D.C., are reporters from NPR, The New York Times, The Washington Post and the major Israeli outlets.The conversation was Israeli-style: freewheeling, uninhibited and pushy. There was a lively debate among journalists and spokespeople about the ground rules of what would be off the record.Initially, the atmosphere was tense. Netanyahu declined to address on record Monday's explosive news in Israel — that his confidant and former media adviser Nir Hefetz agreed to cooperate with police as a witness for the state and offer testimony in corruption cases Netanyahu faces.Israeli media reported Hefetz would testify that Netanyahu's son and wife interfered in his decision-making on matters of national security. Hefetz is the third Netanyahu confidant to make a deal with authorities to provide information for their corruption probes in exchange for a promise of lesser punishment.Netanyahu's spokesman raised questions about the police's recruitment of state's witnesses, and Netanyahu himself has accused police investigators of a plot to frame him.NPR asked Netanyahu to respond to criticism that by raising doubts about the police's motives he was attacking the Israeli democratic institution of law enforcement. Netanyahu said he was ""not willing to answer"" and did not accept the ""premises"" of the question.Netanyahu said his police investigations did not come up in his meeting with Trump. In response to a question from NPR about a Washington Post report that Israel was among four countries seeking to take advantage of Jared Kushner to gain leverage, Netanyahu said the matter did not arise in their discussion and declined to comment further.The prime minister steered the conversation to his meeting with Trump, which lasted 2.5 hours, according to his office. The central issue Netanyahu raised, he said, was: ""Iran, Iran and Iran.""""The president is very knowledgeable about Iran,"" Netanyahu said. ""He has impressive knowledge of the details.""Trump faces a May deadline to decide whether to impose nuclear sanctions on Iran again, which would effectively render the U.S. as pulling out of the Iranian nuclear agreement.""The president will decide whether to renew the agreement,"" Netanyahu said. ""He was very interested in my estimations and my recommendations."" His advice: ""Fully fix, or get rid of it, fully nix. This is what I told him.""He said the two leaders discussed the Palestinians. As for Trump's long-anticipated peace proposal, Netanyahu said he ""did not see a draft"" during Monday's meeting. But he would not say whether he has seen a draft before.When asked if he believed in the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — establishing Palestine alongside Israel — Netanyahu said, ""I haven't named it. But I've defined it."" He said Israel did not seek to govern the Palestinians but that Israel must retain overriding security control of the West Bank, which Palestinians seek for a state, arguing that the Palestinians are not capable of rooting out violence.""There is no ability by the Palestinians to deal with these things. Who does the job is the Israeli security forces,"" Netanyahu said. ""You can say it will be good if we give them a state ... empirically it doesn't work with what we see.""The Palestinians have suggested an international monitoring force in the West Bank in the event of a Palestinian state — but refuse to accept any Israeli military presence long term.In a nod to his upcoming speech before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington on Tuesday, Netanyahu addressed a question about Israel becoming increasingly a polarizing and partisan issue in the U.S., especially among American Jews.Liberal streams of Judaism, which are dominant in the U.S., say they are discriminated against in Israel, and complain about Netanyahu tabling a decision to build an official mixed-gender prayer space at the Western Wall, the Jewish holy site in Jerusalem. Netanyahu said the move faces ultra-Orthodox opposition and ""I am trying to unjam it."" Netanyahu pledged there would be an upgraded prayer space there.""I want every Jew to be comfortable in Israel,"" Netanyahu said.Later Israeli reporters bantered with Netanyahu about television, and Netanyahu offered a TV recommendation: Big Blue Live, a PBS wildlife documentary.""Big Blue — you have to see it. It's amazing,"" he told reporters."

Steve Lebsock, who is accused of sexually harassing or intimidating at least nine legislators, staffers and lobbyists, as NPR member station KUNC first reported in November.And as the vote on Lebsock's fate approached, two legislators who had been vocal in advocating for the accusers began taking additional steps to protect themselves.""I bought a bulletproof vest,"" Assistant Majority Leader Alec Garnett told the chamber on Friday, tearing up. ""And I'm wearing it. It's right here.""He patted his chest.""I'm wearing Kevlar,"" he said. ""Because I fear for retaliation. I am in the chamber of the House of Representatives, and I'm wearing a bulletproof vest because I fear retaliation for telling the truth and standing up for victims of sexual harassment. I've been wearing it for three weeks.""Garnett, a Democrat, told The Denver Post that he was specifically worried about the potential for violence from Lebsock, who he said had threatened to ""take [him] down.' ""He said he had stopped buttoning up his shirt or tying his tie before getting to work.""Because once I get in here I have to put on my bulletproof vest, because my wife doesn't want to see me put it on,"" Garnett explained. ""So I walk into my office. There's a sign that says 'Harassment Free.' And I put on my bulletproof vest. And I button up my shirt and I go into the members' bathroom and I tie my tie.""Rep. Matt Gray, also a Democrat, told the chamber he had started wearing one of the vests, too.""I put mine on in the parking garage so my kids don't have to see and I don't have to explain to them what it is,"" he said.The Post reports that Lebsock cried as he replied to hearing about the vests.""Members,"" he said. ""I am an honorably discharged Marine Corps veteran. And if someone walked in here — members, you would have had me here to protect you. Even the ones that don't like me. I'm just hoping you know that.""A Republican member of the House, Lori Saine, told KUNC's Bente Birkeland recently that many in her party's caucus carry concealed guns in the Capitol, which she said makes her feel secure.But Democratic Rep. Jonathan Singer told KUNC he thought guns in the Capitol were a bad idea.""When you enter a government building, when there are heated vigorous debates and people are on edge, sleep deprived and — you know, let's be honest — there are people in this building who are drinking, that is a deadly mix,"" said Singer.Democratic Rep. Faith Winter was the first to file an official complaint of misconduct against Lebsock, who she says made aggressive and angry unwanted sexual advances toward her at a party celebrating the end of the 2016 legislative session. She decided to come forward with the allegations after learning that other women said they'd experienced similar harassment from Lebsock, suggesting a pattern of behavior.""The women in the building are going to be believed,"" Winter told Colorado Public Radio after the vote to expel Lebsock. ""They felt that their voices were heard and valued, and I think it's going to change the culture there.""Though some Republicans argued that expulsion was a ""nuclear option"" that appropriated the will of the voters, many members shared emotional stories of harassment, abuse or rape that they or their loved ones have experienced.Lebsock, who is still a candidate for state treasurer, left the chamber after his expulsion. Only later did members learn that minutes before his departure, he changed his affiliation to Republican — making it possible for the GOP to fill his now-vacant seat."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/590877835/congressional-republicans-lobby-trump-to-back-down-on-tariffs","Updated at 3:00 p.m. ETFears of economic and political backlash are motivating senior congressional Republicans to move forward this week with public and private lobbying efforts aimed at getting President Trump to change his mind about tariffs he intends to levy on steel and aluminium imports.""We are extremely worried about the consequences of a trade war and are urging the White House to not advance with this plan,"" AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said in a statement. ""The new tax reform law has boosted the economy and we certainly don't want to jeopardize those gains.""President Trump downplayed congressional GOP concerns. ""I don't think you're going to have a trade war,"" he said Monday at the White House, where he defended his decision to crack down on imports. ""People have to understand, our country on trade, has been ripped off by virtually every country in the world whether it's friend or enemy. Everybody.""The president noted that his efforts to renegotiate NAFTA continue as well. ""We are renegotiating NAFTA as I said I would, and if we don't make a deal I will terminate NAFTA,"" he warned.Congress is not ruling out possible legislative action to counter Trump's actions, although party leaders have no immediate plans to act if the president moves forward this week as stated with imposing tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum imports.Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, R-Texas, and the panel's trade subcommittee chairman, David Reichert, R-Wash., have also drafted a letter to the president outlining concerns about new tariffs. They are seeking additional signatures from House Republicans. Aides said lawmakers were hoping to avoid a confrontation with the administration and instead work with the president to enact trade policies the broader GOP can get behind.""As the two chairmen have reinforced, the administration and Congress must work together on trade policies that build off the momentum of the president's tax cuts, which is why any tariffs should be narrow, targeted, and focused on addressing unfairly traded products, without disrupting the flow of fairly traded products for American businesses and consumers,"" Lauren Aronson, a spokeswoman for the Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement.Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, is also expected to send a letter to the president this week asking him to reconsider his position. Hatch opposes new tariffs because he believes they will undermine any economic boost delivered by the GOP's tax cuts. ""Should the administration opt to move forward with tariffs on steel and aluminum, American manufacturers, businesses, and consumers would be forced to bear the brunt paying more for steel and steel products. Such action could very well undercut the benefits of the pro-growth tax reform we fought to get on the books,"" Hatch said in a weekend statement.The White House showed no indication Monday that the president was considering changing his mind. ""The president is resolute about this, and no one should be surprised either at that resoluteness or the fact that it's going to happen,"" said National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro, a top Trump aide who, along with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, has been the strongest administration advocate for new tariffs.""Understand that all the rhetoric that's being generated about this is being generated by the lobbyists on K Street and the politicians who are fundamentally opposed to what the president wants to do on behalf of the American worker and on behalf of the country,"" Navarro said. ""This is a very well-informed decision.""Trump's decision is the starkest break from traditional GOP economic philosophy on trade since taking office. The president has found few GOP allies on Capitol Hill, but Rust Belt Democrats up for re-election this year cheered the administration's decision. ""This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,"" said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. Likewise, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., called Trump's decision a ""welcome step.""Republicans were frustrated and taken by surprise by the timing of the president's announcement last week that steel and aluminum tariffs were imminent. Republicans generally support a more targeted approach to pushing back on cheap foreign imports — a message they delivered directly to Trump in several recent meetings. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, one of the top Republicans in the Senate, was among those who were caught off guard last week when Trump made the announcement.""I don't know how to explain it because I've been in meetings with him on trade,"" Thune told reporters. ""Everybody's been very clear that we think some of the decisions that they're talking about making and policies they're talking about implementing would be very harmful to the economy at a time when it's really taking off.""Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., has argued that a blanket tariff fails to directly punish countries like China for dumping low-cost steel in the American market. Graham said Sunday that Trump would ""let China off the hook"" while punishing U.S. companies that sell goods abroad by inviting retaliatory tariffs from other global trading partners. ""The reason our steel industry has been decimated is because of China dumping,"" Graham said in an interview on CBS's Face the Nation. ""China produces more steel than the world consumes for several years in a row. China is your problem, Mr. President.""Congress technically has legislative options to counter Trump's tariffs if he moves ahead with them despite opposition, but it would require a somewhat extraordinary move on the part of Republicans to craft legislation cracking down on their own president in an election year. Republicans would also likely need vetoproof majorities in both chambers to have any effect. And any legislative move would also upend orthodoxy on trade policy, which is generally enacted with the view that the president should be given latitude to manage international trade."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/590296136/robert-muellers-pace-measures-up-with-best-prosecutors-in-modern-history","The man leading the Justice Department's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election has been keeping busy.Special counsel Robert Mueller has been on the job for about nine months. But he has already charged 19 people with wrongdoing — and won guilty pleas from the president's former campaign vice chairman and his former national security adviser.Scholars who focus on politically charged investigations that may lead into the White House have been taking note.""Robert Mueller's pace in this investigation really is very similar to some of the best special prosecutors in modern history,"" said Ken Gormley, the president of Duquesne University and the author of two books on special prosecutors.These investigations carry special burdens: to move forward quietly, with no leaks, and quickly, to prove guilt or innocence.""The whole point of appointing an independent counsel in these kind of instances is to deal with the fact that there's a cloud over the highest levels of the executive branch and to restore public confidence, one way or the other,"" Gormley said.For many people, the model prosecutor was Archibald Cox, who investigated Watergate for a little more than a year before he was fired.""I'm not looking for a confrontation,"" Cox told reporters in 1973. ""I've worried a good deal through my life about the problems of imposing too much strain upon our constitutional institutions and I'm certainly not out to get the president of the United States.""During his tenure, Cox developed evidence about obstruction of justice by President Richard Nixon. The prosecutor who replaced Cox built on that work, ultimately leading to Nixon's resignation.Gormley said the current special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, is operating in that same mold.But at the White House, President Trump and his lawyers have been pressing the Mueller team to move faster. So is another familiar figure: former Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr.""The American people, I think, want to know, was there collusion,"" Starr told CNN last week. ""Let's get that answered. That would be my sense, if I were at the Justice Department.""Starr spent five years and more than $40 million investigating President Bill Clinton. Critics say Starr took too long and wandered away from his original mission. He was far from the only independent counsel to come under attack as a ""roving Frankenstein monster,"" Gormley said.In the category of ""no end,"" there was the investigation of Clinton's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry Cisneros. In 1995, then-Attorney General Janet Reno asked for an independent counsel to determine whether Cisneros should face prosecution for providing false information about payments to a former mistress.""I'm disappointed by that outcome but I'm hopeful that the investigation will be completed expeditiously,"" Cisneros told reporters at the time.But any hope Cisneros had for a speedy resolution went bust. The independent counsel in his case, David Barrett, kept working even after the law authorizing his work expired. Cisneros pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was later pardoned by the president. Still, Barrett's work continued. The final report emerged in 2006, nearly 11 years after he took office.Robert Mueller is a hard-driving former FBI director, not known for dallying in his work. He's already secured indictments against Russians for running an information warfare campaign aimed at the last presidential election.And yet, Wake Forest University professor Katy Harriger said measuring Mueller's success will be a challenge.""For some people, success will only be if somehow the president gets impeached,"" Harriger said. ""And for other people, success is a complete exoneration.""Push away that cloud of politics, she said, and success may be a report or a set of conclusions that most people can believe."

But by the time the candidate bounces through the door, they're unfolding dozens more chairs as the crowd zooms past 100.O'Rourke, who currently represents the El Paso area in the U.S. House, is running for the chance to unseat the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz. No Democrat has represented the Lone Star State in the Senate since 1993, but O'Rourke believes he can beat the odds, in part by campaigning aggressively in every part of this sprawling state.""Of the 254 counties [in Texas], we've visited 226 so far. This is 226 today,"" O'Rourke tells the crowd, who have been chanting, ""Beto, Beto!""O'Rourke has his work cut out for him. A recent Texas Politics Project poll showed nearly 40 percent of Texas voters have no idea who he is.But county by county, O'Rourke is slowly getting his name out with crowded, grass-roots events like the one in Pittsburg.""I love Beto, I came out to see him. I've probably seen him eight times. He stands for everything that Ted Cruz doesn't and I think he's the real deal,"" said retired teacher Barbara Rosel.O'Rourke's substantial fundraising has also drawn notice.""In the first 45 days of this year we raised $2.3 million with an average online contribution of 25 bucks,"" said O'Rourke as he spoke to NPR while sitting down for lunch at a Pittsburg restaurant called Hot Links. Cruz raised about $800,000 during the same period. ""I just haven't seen this kind of excitement and energy and willingness to do what it takes in Texas in my life,"" O'Rourke added.That fundraising may help him make up for the lack of awareness Texas voters have of the Democrat, according to Texas Tribune executive editor and political analyst Ross Ramsey. ""I think he'll have enough money, whether they vote red or blue in November, Texans will know who Beto O'Rourke really is,"" Ramsey told NPR.O'Rourke is capitalizing on an extremely restive Democratic electorate. Although Texas Democrats have been largely shut out of statewide office for the past two decades, they've been closing the gap with Republicans. In 2016, Hillary Clinton got 600,000 more votes in Texas than Barack Obama did just four years earlier. President Trump won the state by about 9 percent.O'Rourke says the president has a lot to do with the energy among Democrats.""They're coming out because they don't want a wall [with Mexico]. People are coming out because they don't want to hear the president refer to the countries of Africa as 's***hole' nations,"" said O'Rourke. ""People are coming out because they don't think the press is the enemy of the people, they think they're the best defense against tyranny. People are coming out because they want women to be treated with dignity and respect.""The tall, thin 45-year-old sometimes gets described as a West Texas version of John F. Kennedy. But it's O'Rourke's unabashed liberalism and earnest delivery that makes Democrats swoon.At the Pittsburg event, O'Rourke criticized the state's decision to shut down family planning clinics, arguing it has resulted in sky-high maternal mortality rates. In a state where guns are sometimes seen as a birthright, he argues for universal background checks and an assault weapons ban.O'Rourke has two challengers in this Tuesday's Democratic primary, but had a 50 point lead in the latest polling.This fall, it's likely O'Rourke will face Ted Cruz in the general election. Although Cruz's reputation with Republican voters suffered when he refused to endorse Donald Trump's nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention, he is an accomplished fundraiser and formidable opponent.Cruz's campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but Cruz is taking the race seriously.He recently warned Houston-area Republicans: ""The left is going to show up. They will crawl over broken glass in November to vote.""Early voting numbers in Tuesday's Texas primaries show that Democrats have more than doubled their numbers from the same point in the 2014 midterms, while Republicans are up only 15 percent, according to David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report.Ramsey warns that it's easy to read too much into early vote totals, since they may just indicate Democrats are taking advantage of the convenience of early voting. The final turnout on Tuesday will be a better indication of where things sit.""It's still a Republican state. It would take a lot of things to fall in place, but that said, up to this date O'Rourke has a lot of things going for him,"" Ramsey said.He added that many Texas political observers are reminding themselves that they saw the rise of another long-shot Senate candidate six years ago.His name was Ted Cruz."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/04/590313279/ahead-of-texas-primary-early-signs-of-a-2018-democratic-surge","Updated on March 5 at 7:13 p.m. ET The 2018 primary elections kick off this week, and Democrats are already seeing reasons to be excited deep in the red, beating heart of Texas.The Lone Star State holds the nation's first primary on Tuesday, and in the 11 days of early voting Democrats reached record levels in a midterm year. They surpassed GOP early voting turnout this year and their own party's numbers during the same period in 2016, a presidential election year where voting numbers are typically much higher, and more than doubled their turnout from the last midterm election in 2014.The rising Democratic enthusiasm mirrors what the party has already seen across the country in the nearly year and a half since President Trump was elected — more than three dozen state legislature seats changing hands, important wins in Virginia and New Jersey last year and mobilization through rallies and protests.Texas's primary brings the first actual voting in the 2018 midterm cycle, giving both parties a chance for a more concrete measure ahead of November's elections. Early signs of such a swell in a bulwark red state could be an even more ominous sign for Republicans nationally this fall if it's borne out by Tuesday's results.""Texas is the nation's bellwether right now,"" said Tariq Thowfeek, the communications director for the Texas Democratic Party. ""It's a good gauge of the incredible progressive energy we have across the country in a state that is ranked at the bottom of the barrel in voter turnout.""The Cook Political Report's David Wasserman found that in the top 15 counties in the state, the Democratic early vote had spiked 105 percent over 2014 numbers. On the Republican side, there had been only a 15 percent uptick.A surge in Democrats on the ballot It's not just an uptick in Democratic voters happening in Texas, but an increase in candidates putting their names on the ballot, too. Democrats are fielding a modern-day record number of candidates across the state. There are 111 U.S. House candidates running for the minority party, and they are spread across all 36 Texas congressional districts — the first time that's happened in 25 years, and a departure from two years ago when Democrats didn't run candidates in eight seats.On a state legislative level, Democrats have candidates in 132 of the 150 state House districts and in 14 of the 15 state Senate districts up for election this year. That includes four Senate districts where Democrats didn't field candidates in 2014 or 2012, and 20 new House districts where they didn't have candidates in either 2016, 2014 or 2012.Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, said that the Democratic surge is even more impressive given that it's usually GOP voters, not Democrats, who have been reliable in non-presidential years.""It's one word — enthusiasm. In a midterm election like this, what you normally expect to see is the Republicans' primary turnout might be twice what the Democratic turnout is, so to have the Democrats even with, and even slightly ahead, of Republicans in this midterm election is really extraordinary,"" Jillson said.Key suburban swing districts are likely to determine control of the House in 2018. There are several GOP-held districts like that which could be at play in Texas, such as Rep. Pete Sessions's suburban Dallas seat and Rep. John Culberson's suburban Houston district, which, along with Rep. Will Hurd's expansive border district that runs from San Antonio to El Paso, all voted for Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016.""Going into this year, there was an expectation following the Women's March, in the wake of the elections in New Jersey and Virginia and all these special elections that something similar was likely to happen in the first-in-the-nation Texas primary, and I think it has,"" SMU's Jillson said. ""It signals a Democratic electorate that is motivated to make a statement against Donald Trump, and that motivation is nowhere more powerful than in female voters.""There's been a downside to the Democrats' surge of candidates in some places, however. In the primary to face Culberson, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee recently lobbed attacks against one candidate they didn't feel would be a strong challenger given past derisive comments about places in the state. That move prompted a backlash from some progressive groups and criticism from the head of the Democratic National Committee.Matt Angle, a longtime Texas Democratic strategist and director of the Lone Star Project, said the sheer number of candidates was still a positive thing for Democrats in a state where they've had trouble recruiting in the past, and noted that other primaries have been more civil. Those are encouraging signs, he said, for the way the state is trending politically.""Make no mistake — it's a tough lift in Texas. It's a state still that is a right of center state, but I'm very encouraged,"" Angle said. ""The excitement being generated now among candidates will not only build, it will consolidate.""Backlash to Trump President Trump under-performed past GOP presidential nominees in the state, carrying it in 2016 by only single digits, and a Gallup poll released at the end of January showed that the president's approval rating in Texas had dropped below 40 percent.While Trump's approval among Republican base voters remains strong, that dissatisfaction with the president is certainly driving Democratic turnout and convincing more disaffected voters to turn blue, Angle argued. For example, that has helped Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke in his upstart campaign to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. While O'Rourke still remains an underdog, he's been drawing large crowds and has even outraised Cruz recently with the help of small-dollar donors.""In Texas, I think what you do have a chance to do is build a really strong coalition of Democrats, independents and fair-minded Republicans who are disillusioned with the type of leadership they're getting,"" Angle said.Texas GOP strategist Derek Ryan pointed out that Democrats do have some major statewide primaries, such as the gubernatorial race, that could be driving some turnout, but admitted that Democrats have done a good job of recruiting candidates across the board, thus making those competitive races more appealing to some voters.Ryan also acknowledged that the rise in Democratic enthusiasm is worrisome for Republicans — especially because Democrats have gotten many low propensity voters to the polls. He's been diving into the early voting data, and his analysis found that many of those primary voters are ones that voted in 2016 — but haven't had a proclivity to vote yet in a midterm year when turnout typically drops off. And nearly a quarter of Democrats who cast early ballots were new voters who just registered in the past two years.On the GOP side, Ryan found that first-time primary voters only made up about 11 percent of the early vote share, which is a dip from the 2014 midterm primaries. However, on the Democratic side, first time primary voters comprise over nearly a quarter of the early vote — way up from the 14 percent four years ago.""While I don't think that Texas is going to turn blue this cycle, I do think with these turnout numbers, it could have a significant impact in some races, and some leaning Republican races in November,"" Ryan said.Matt Mackowiak, another Republican strategist in the state and chairman of the Travis County GOP, argued that the true test of Democratic enthusiasm will be on Tuesday night. He pointed out that early voting numbers also looked strong for Clinton back in 2016, but that was her high watermark and Election Day voting couldn't match Republican totals.""For Republicans, if this is evidence of a significant enthusiasm gap, then that would be something to worry about,"" Mackowiak said. ""I'm not sure that it is yet, and just because you have stronger turnout in the primary doesn't mean it translates into Election Day vote in November.""But he admitted that the early numbers should give Republicans some pause and they certainly don't hold any good news if the trend continues on Tuesday.""There's no way to look at this as positive for Republicans — it's either inconsequential, or it's bad,"" Mackowiak said."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/03/590583598/before-trump-announced-tariffs-icahn-sold-off-millions-in-steel-related-stocks","Updated at 5:20 p.m. ETA former adviser to President Trump sold off $31.3 million in stocks he owned in a steel-dependent company, just days before the president announced hefty tariffs on foreign-made steel.Carl Icahn, a billionaire investor and Trump's former ""special adviser to the president on regulatory reform,"" sold the shares between Feb. 12 and Feb. 22, according to an SEC filing that was first reported on by the left-leaning website ThinkProgress.The shares Icahn sold, in the Manitowoc Company, have lost value fairly steadily over the past month but took another tumble Thursday and Friday after Trump announced that he would impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel.Manitowoc is a global manufacturer of cranes and is therefore highly dependent on steel. Reuters mentioned that the company's stock fell more than 6 percent Thursday in a story about how companies around the world were reacting to the tariff announcement.Icahn sold the stock for between $32 and $34 a share in February, but the price of a share at market close on Friday was $26.93. The sale represented roughly a third of Icahn's total ownership stake in the company, according to CNBC.""After the trades, Icahn owned 4.85 percent of the company, down from his previous stake of 7.5 percent,"" CNBC's Tae Kim reported. The resulting 4.85 percent stake means Icahn does not have to report further sales of the company's stock to the SEC, according to The Street.Before last month, Icahn had not been active with the Manitowoc stocks in years, reported The Washington Post. The last time he traded it was in January 2015.In February, however, he began selling his shares in the company before the public knew a steel tariff could be on the immediate horizon. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross announced that he was recommending the tariff to the president on Feb. 16.Icahn has not commented publicly about the trades and has not responded to requests for comment by NPR, made on Saturday.On Friday, a White House spokesman dismissed the idea that the president would have fed Icahn any insider information, pointing to the fact that Trump has long said both publicly and privately that he wanted to impose tariffs.Icahn told CNBC in an interview on Thursday that he hadn't ""had much interaction with [Trump] at all in the past four or five months.""The $31 million represents a drop in the bucket of Icahn's vast wealth. He ranks No. 27 on the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans for 2017, with an estimated net worth of nearly $17 billion.From virtually the moment Trump named him an adviser to deal with ""the strangling regulations that our country is faced with,"" Icahn faced questions about how the policies he advocated for would help his finances.He advocated for policies and vetted two Cabinet nominees, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton, as NPR's Peter Overby reported, despite owning an oil refinery company with a significant stake in policies mandated by the EPA and a large stake in a company that was being investigated by the SEC.He ended up quitting the position in August 2017, just hours before The New Yorker published a long article detailing his conflicts of interest.""I never had access to nonpublic information or profited from my position,"" Icahn wrote in his letter announcing his resignation from the role, ""nor do I believe that my role presented conflicts of interest.""The decades-long relationship between Trump and Icahn ""is one of friends turned foes turned friends,"" the Post reported. The two businessmen have known each other since the 1980s and had business dealings related to the Taj Mahal casino beginning in the 1990s, according to the Post.NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith contributed to this report."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/04/590660482/at-gridiron-dinner-trump-trades-jabs-with-his-opposition-party","Updated at 2:15 p.m. ETPresident Trump suited up in white tie and tails for an evening of levity and charm Saturday with his cordial hosts, the journalists he has affectionately referred to as ""the enemy of the American people"" — and had, as recently as a few hours beforehand, described as ""being mocked all over the world."" The journalists organizing the event, for their part, served up skits for him and a few pointed jabs at his administration.All in attendance dined on a three-course meal, laid out with ""Fake Menus.""Welcome to the Gridiron Club and Foundation's 2018 spring dinner. Here, in the crowded basement ballroom of a swanky D.C. hotel, the mockery is at least kind of the point: For 133 years, journalists have invited a constellation of Washington's bright stars in media and politics to reach across whatever distances divide them for a good verbal kick in the shin — and a hearty laugh about it together.You can see how this might get weird.""I know the Gridiron is really an old tradition in Washington — been around a long time, and one that's important to many of you in the media,"" Trump told the journalists gathered in the room, whom he termed his ""opposition party"" at one point in his half-hour comedy set. ""So I was very excited to receive this invitation to come here and ruin your evening in person.""Trump takes the stageIt was just the latest Gridiron invitation accepted by a U.S. president, all but one of whom have attended the ritzy, closed-door dinner since the elite media organization's founding in 1885. (We're casting a stern eye in your direction, Grover Cleveland.)But it's fair to say this time felt different: Trump famously turned down Washington's high-profile political media schmoozefests during his first year in office, not only rejecting the Gridiron but the White House Correspondents Dinner last year, as well. In fact, to this point, the only media gala Trump has planned to take part in during his young presidency was one of his own creation, The Highly-Anticipated 2017 Fake News Awards, and that turned out to be a Web page.Still, standing behind the podium and flanked by a minor pantheon of Cabinet members and aides, Trump appeared to relish the opportunity to let loose, training his fire on just about everyone during the roast-style event.There was his son-in-law seated to his left, Jared Kushner: ""You know, we were late tonight because Jared could not get through security.""His treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, sitting to his right: ""America has a proud history of treasury secretaries who sponsored the arts. Alexander Hamilton gave us so much. Andrew Mellon famously gave us the National Gallery — a tremendous gift. Steve has given us the blockbuster movie Lego Batman.""There was Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a favorite object of Trump's biting comments on Twitter, getting one this time in person: ""You know, it's weird, I offered him a ride over — and he recused himself!""Then he turned to his senior adviser Stephen Miller and wife, Melania.""I like turnover,"" he said. ""Now the question everybody keeps asking is, who is going to be the next to leave, Steve Miller or Melania?""""That is terrible, honey — but you love me, right?"" he added, turning to his wife as the joke was greeted with gasps from the audience. And after she mouthed something off-mic, he said to the crowd: ""I won't tell you what she said.""The governing rule behind the evening's roast-style comedy — as laid out by Gridiron President David Lightman at the start of the night — was to ""singe, not burn."" It was guidance Trump observed ... for the most part. To muddy a beloved adage: He reserved the brunt of his heat for some of the absent figures who had stayed out of the kitchen — such as his former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who Trump called one of CNN's ""true stars, the guy who got you the most scoops and inside info.""That included apparently ad libbed broadsides lobbed at former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (""man, she's crazy — but she's a fine woman""), former Vice President Joe Biden (""trust me, I would kick his ass"") and Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, which has been investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election: ""What is he, on some committee? That's the only thing he doesn't know, is what committee — because he's on the phone so much, he doesn't have any time. Hey!""And then he turned to Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California."" 'He must be impeached!' That's all she knows how to say,"" Trump told the crowd. ""And I say — and I get in trouble for this — 'she has to immediately take an IQ test,' and people go crazy.""""There's so much hatred,"" he added a few seconds later. ""We have to stop the hatred.""Building bridges with North Korea?At one point deep in Trump's set, a moment of genuine policy appeared to glimmer through the cloud of quips and digs — though whether that moment was to be taken seriously or lightly remains unclear.""I won't rule out direct talks with [North Korean dictator] Kim Jong Un — I just won't. As far as the risk of dealing with a madman is concerned, that's his problem, not mine,"" he said. ""He must be a fine man — do you think he's a fine man?""Late last month the South Korean leadership said North Korea was open to dialogue with the U.S., potentially dialing down the tensions that have simmered between the two countries in recent months. Trump himself has traded barbs with Kim throughout much of his presidency.""They, by the way, called up a couple of days ago. They said, 'We would like to talk.' And I said, 'So would we, but you have to denuke,' "" Trump said, shifting his tone.""Maybe positive things are happening now,"" he added. ""I hope that's true. I say that in all seriousness: I hope that's true.""Trump seemed happy with his performance at the dinner, tweeting early Sunday afternoon, ""The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something, and especially since this is for the American People!""Building walls with the warm-up actsTrump, of course, was but the closer. The sets and sketches before him teemed with other high-profile figures thrust into unfamiliar roles.""We practiced very hard for things that don't come naturally to us,"" said Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, referring to his wife, Anna Peckham. ""For me, comedy speech; for Anna, laughing at my jokes.""Cotton represented the GOP side of the aisle with his set, following the Democratic mayor of New Orleans, Mitch Landrieu. Encouraged by the fact Trump accepted the Gridiron invitation, Landrieu extended one of his own to the president: Come to the Big Easy, which has ""everything Donald Trump likes and talks about.""Parades, for instance — and walls.""You like walls. We've got one of those. It's called the levee,"" Landrieu said. ""Too much public leaking goes on during Mardi Gras all the time. Gold: we've got that too. There are enough gold doubloons in the city of New Orleans you could literally write your name across a building in huge gold letters. Not that anybody would want to do that.""And all the while — before, between and after the two politicians' sets — the journalists of the Gridiron Club carried out another tradition, dressing up and performing musical skits swiping broadly at politicians and themselves. Lifting the tunes to popular standards and swapping in some barbed lyrics of their own, not unlike the Capitol Steps, reporters and anchors traded in their gravitas for some amateur theatrics.Speaking of weirdness, it's not often the common viewer gets a good look at [name redacted, to protect professional dignity] in a silver sequined tuxedo; [yup, these are redacted too] giving Michael Jackson's ""Thriller"" dance an honest, if imperfect try; and [you'd better believe this one's redacted] dancing in a peacock suit to the belted tones of a Carly Simon satire.""You're so vain,"" sang the pantsuited ladies in front of the dancing peacock as one woman, dressed as Hillary Clinton, crooned: ""Why can't you let this show be about me? I'm in pain! For 30 years the show's been about me.""In the end, though, this show was about Trump — or ""King Chaos,"" as Landrieu attempted to christen him. ""I mean, if it fits.""""I like chaos,"" Trump said in his own set. ""It really is good.""And he closed the night of sparring with one final haymaker.""I do want to say this is one of the best times I can ever remember having with the media,"" he said. ""This might be the most fun I've had since watching your faces on election night."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/03/590475332/a-week-lost-in-the-west-wing-reality-show","Updated at 9:43 a.m. ETIn the annals of tumultuous weeks for the still-young Trump presidency, there may not have been a more chaotic one than this, outside of his reaction to and the fallout from the summer's racist violence in Charlottesville, Va.""The chaos at the White House seems to be getting worse,"" said Alex Conant, a former spokesman at the Republican National Committee and senior adviser to Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. ""The constant staff turnover and the inability to turn the page on negative stories makes it impossible to push a positive agenda. There is really good work being done by this administration at the agency level, but it gets lost in the West Wing reality show.""Think about everything that happened just this week:There's no Hope: Communications director Hope Hicks, an original Trump loyalist, quits after reportedly telling the House intelligence committee that she sometimes tells white lies for President Trump. Trump berates her, asking her how could she be so ""stupid."" The next day, she announces her impending departure from the White House. Hicks was Trump's fourth communications director in just 13 months — and one of some 50 White House staffers who have quit, been fired or reassigned.Retreat on guns: Trump declares on Monday about the Florida school shooting, ""I really believe I'd run in there even if I didn't have a weapon."" He then holds a made-for-cable-TV White House meeting on guns Wednesday that shows his shallow policy understanding of the subject and the allegiances in the room. (We fact-checked it here.) He accuses senators of ""being afraid of the NRA."" He angers conservatives, and gun legislation is pushed off indefinitely. By Friday, he appears to retreat from more liberal positions on guns he had seemed to endorse in the Wednesday meeting and meets with the NRA, and they tweet praise for each other.He went to Jared: Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, sees his security clearance downgraded to a level that means he can't read the president's daily brief. It's also revealed that the president's daughter and Kushner's wife, Ivanka, is also reportedly being investigated by the FBI for one of her business deals. And it's announced the couple's spokesman will be leaving the White House.""Mr. Magoo"" fights back: Trump feuds again with his attorney general, questioning his handing off a review of use of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court by the FBI to the Justice Department's inspector general. Trump calls the move ""DISGRACEFUL!"" Behind his back, Trump reportedly calls Jeff Sessions ""Mr. Magoo."" Sessions stands up for himself and says as long as he is in the job, he'll do it with dignity. He then dines out in plain view at an upscale Washington, D.C., restaurant with Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, and Solicitor General Noel Francisco — an apparent show of unity in the topmost ranks of the Department of Justice.Man of God: White House chief of staff John Kelly, who stripped Kushner of his top-secret security clearance, jokes that he never wanted to leave the Department of Homeland Security and that he misses the staffers there more than ever, rolls his eyes and says, ""God punished me."" Kelly has had a rough go of it lately as chief of staff running a West Wing rocked by a domestic abuse scandal involving former staff secretary Rob Porter and questions about background checks and interim security clearances for Porter, Kushner and other staffers. But he told reporters Friday that he did not offer to resign over the Porter episode. ""I have absolutely nothing to even consider resigning over,"" the retired Marine Corps general said after walking some journalists through the timeline of how the White House handled revelations about Porter.Never get involved in a trade war in Asia! Trump hastily announces 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports to Make American Steel Great Again, but he winds up angering conservative business interests, including manufacturers and the oil industry. He also overrules economic adviser Gary Cohn, fueling speculation that he, too, is not long for this White House. Amid the backlash, Trump reacts by tweeting, ""trade wars are good, and easy to win."" The Dow drops 420 points on the news.Huh-D? Ben Carson, Trump's housing and urban development secretary, faces backlash for approval of lavish spending, which includes more than $31,000 for a new office suite dining room set. A former HUD official claims she was told by superiors, NPR's Brakkton Booker reports, to ""find money"" above the $5,000 spending limit to outfit the office.""Alex"" Baldwin at 5:42 a.m.: Inexplicably, Trump begins Friday by taking aim at Alec Baldwin, mistakenly calling the actor ""Alex"" Baldwin on Twitter (before deleting it). (The real Alex Baldwin didn't appreciate it.) Trump reposts online correcting the spelling and slamming Baldwin for his impersonation of Trump on Saturday Night Live (and saying Darrell Hammond is better). Baldwin responds, tweeting he would ""like to hang in for the impeachment hearings"" and alluding to the latest rumors of Trump's paramours.""Every day feels like a week, every week like a month ...""Watching it all has left veteran Republican strategists scratching their heads — and yet feeling unsurprised.""There were probably a dozen things that happened this past week that in isolation would have generated huge headlines and headaches for past White Houses,"" said Brian Jones, a GOP political consultant, who has worked on five presidential campaigns, including George W. Bush's, John McCain's and Mitt Romney's. ""Collectively, the pace of the bad news really seemed to quicken this week for Trump, which is notable given that this White House has established a new gold standard for wild news cycles.""Kevin Madden, another Republican campaign and Capitol Hill veteran, said he is not so sure that this week is worse than others — or if it just feels that way.""With this administration, every day feels like a week, every week like a month and every month like a year,"" he said. ""It's not that this one was different, because there have been weeks just as bad, but we've almost become inured to the past effect since there have been so many of them. The thing that's more and more apparent is that the trend line never seems to get better or the chaos less frequent. There's no sense that a stabilization is occurring or even on the horizon.""That is a point Jones drives home, noting that the ""containment team"" is dwindling in numbers and influence — and who knows what that could mean for the future of the Trump presidency.""Since Trump's election, there's been this underlying chaos in the White House, but on some level, it's been mitigated by people like Hope Hicks, Gary Cohn, immediate family members and a few others,"" Jones said. ""With that containment team either leaving the White House or being under fire, it seems like we're now in a new world of free-form chaos."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/03/590474158/the-last-bush-tries-to-survive-in-the-party-of-trump","In a dynasty that dates back over 60 years in American politics, there is just one member of the Bush family left in any state or federal elected office.Texas land commissioner George P. Bush is the one carrying the torch and facing a stiff primary on March 6, barely two years after his father Jeb's presidential bid failed as Donald Trump took over the Republican Party. To survive, the younger Bush has decided to adapt to — rather than resist — the new direction of the GOP.The Bush family political dynasty goes back to 1952. That's when Prescott Bush became a U.S. senator from Connecticut. Then his son George H. W. Bush became president. Jeb Bush would become governor of Florida. After six years as Texas governor, George W. Bush won the presidency, as well. Since he left office nearly a decade ago, there's been a lag.In 2014, George P. Bush announced he was running for Texas land commissioner.Almost as soon as Bush entered that race, he was projected to win. The entire campaign turned into more of a victory tour then political race.""He was a young, vibrant, good looking guy. So he looked like a central casting, next generation Bush candidate, starting in Texas but with national possabilities,"" Southern Methodist University political science professor Cal Jillson said.He breezed through the 2014 GOP primary, easily won the general election in a deep red state, and already had some Republican activists talking about future races for governor — or even president someday.Then the realities of holding office began to sink in. There are questions about how well his office has handled Hurricane Harvey relief. He's also received bad press over his handling of the Alamo. You know, the one we're supposed to remember all the time. Those issues brought criticism from some in the party, and motivated Bush's predecessor, former land commissioner Jerry Patterson, to challenge him in the GOP primary. Patterson had left the office in 2014 in a failed attempt to run for lieutenant governor.So facing a tough primary, George P. Bush has sought out the most coveted endorsement in Republican politics: President Trump.This might be considered a hard endorsement for Bush to get. Trump was the man who labeled his father ""low energy Jeb"" and blamed his uncle for 9/11 during the 2016 GOP presidential primaries. Trump even made a disparaging statement about the fact that George P.'s mother was born in Mexico. His father, uncle and grandparents all said they didn't vote for Trump in the 2016 general election.But George P. Bush endorsed Trump anyway.""From Team Bush, it's a bitter pill to swallow,"" Bush told supporters during a speech in 2016. ""But you know what? You get back up and you help the man that won, and you make sure that we stop Hillary Clinton.""And now that Bush needs help, President Trump is there to provide it. In a tweet from Feb. 27 Trump said, ""Texas [land commissioner] George P. Bush backed me when it wasn't the politically correct thing to do, and I back him now.""While this may appear to be a friendly relationship, the truth is President Trump has rejected much of what the Bush family stood for in politics — whether it's on immigration or foreign policy. Yet, George P. Bush is still trying to bridge that divide.SMU's Jillson wonders whether George P. Bush can fully evolve in what's now Trump's party. ""And now I think people have real questions about what the upside of George P. Bush as a politician and an office holder actually is,"" he said.If Bush loses his GOP primary race on March 6, that could have pundits across the country talking about the end of the Bush political dynasty.Still, it's a big family. Just because George P. was expected to lead the next generation doesn't mean one of his cousins won't.Remember, the family always believed Jeb would be the second president from the Bush dynasty, while George W. lost an early congressional campaign and seemed to enjoy running a baseball team into his forties."

He was praising the fact that the Republican tax legislation, signed into law in December, canceled out the provision of the ACA, or Obamacare, that penalized people who don't purchase health insurance.""[Obamacare] was the stupidest, dumb-ass bill that I've ever seen,"" Hatch said. ""Now some of you may have loved it; if you do, you are one of the stupidest dumb-ass people I've ever met.""In a statement on Friday, Hatch called the comments, which he appeared to be reading as part of prepared remarks, ""a poorly worded joke"" that was ""not reflective of my actual feelings towards my friends on the other side.""""While I occasionally slip up, I believe that my legislative record reflects my commitment to bipartisanship and civility much more than my flippant, off-the-cuff comment,"" his statement said.The majority of American adults, 54 percent, have a favorable view of the ACA, according to the most recent polling from the Kaiser Health Tracking Poll. That represents a shift, however. From the moment it was enacted in 2010, the law had been mostly unpopular. It only began to gain consistent popularity in December 2016, as the possibility it would be repealed intensified when Republicans took control of the White House and both houses of Congress.""I've been all over the world, a number of times, by the way, and frankly there's no other country that even comes close to ours,"" Hatch said Thursday. ""Well, there might be one or two that do pretty well, but they're really not in a league with us. As dumb as we are, and as stupid as some of our policies have been over the years, I can tell you that no other country can compete with the United States if we allow our true entrepreneurial spirit to go forward."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/03/590273206/the-russia-investigations-is-fisa-abuse-out-of-steam-intel-committees-on-edge","This week in the Russia investigations: The ""FISA abuse"" counter-narrative might be running out of steam — and so, apparently, is President Trump's relationship with Attorney General Jeff Sessions; the House and Senate intelligence committees are at daggers drawn; does anybody here know anything about cyber-stuff?The Russia imbroglio is so complex it's sometimes impenetrable. Maneuvering within it politically is much more difficult than any other big story these days.Example A: Republicans want to defend President Trump. One way they've done so is by making a highly wonky case against the FBI and Justice Department, arguing they abused the procedures involved with seeking surveillance warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.The bottom-line argument is easy to grasp — ""biased"" feds are out to get Trump — but keeping it going requires a huge amount of legal and technical explanation. The man who's supposed to be benefiting from all this work has signaled that he might be out of patience.When Attorney General Jeff Sessions tried on Wednesday to put more points on the board for the White House, President Trump smacked him down. Sessions had said he would recommend that the Justice Department's inspector general look into the FISA matter, injecting another day's worth of oxygen into the story. But Trump was all, like, c'mon maaaaan!The IG can't prosecute anybody!, Trump said. Plus he was appointed by President Obama, Trump said — although the IG had also served under George W. Bush — and all this kabuki isn't moving quickly enough or hitting hard enough!In short, the president made clear the ""FISA abuse"" narrative, which has its origins with Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee and House intelligence committee, is weak sauce.Sessions was stung. After all the humiliation he's endured and all the water he has carried, he seemed to say: Enough.The attorney general issued a rare riposte to a routine tongue-lashing from the president. He further tweaked the White House by signalling clearly that he is on Team Justice Department. Sessions made sure to be photographed dining out with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Solicitor General Noel Francisco. Sessions made clear in his statement that so long as he remains attorney general, the Justice Department will work by the book.In other words, Sessions will not launch a baseless criminal investigation into FISA abuse or take other actions that are not warranted, which Trump appeared to want.What does it all mean? Part 1: Sessions wants to stay in his job but keep his crayons inside the lines. He appears to remain confident that he can. Although Trump isn't happy with Sessions, the former senator enjoys a well of support from his former colleagues. That means if the president fired him, Trump might not easily get someone confirmed to take over the Justice Department who was not recused from its Russia investigation, as Sessions is.What does it all mean? Part 2: Sessions never appointed a second special counsel to investigate the first one, Robert Mueller, as Trump supporters and Trump's legal team wanted. Now, Sessions apparently does not believe there is enough evidence of FISA abuse to do more than request an IG investigation — which the IG's office can opt not to pursue. And even if the IG does open a case, it could take months or more to pay off, as Trump complained. Although the Justice Department likely will continue trying to help the White House to a certain degree, it will not act as his law firm on retainer.What does it all mean? Part 3: So, what evidence did which federal officials include in their briefing to which judge with respect to which warrant to request which authority to conduct surveillance on which person and why? The longer the story runs, the more difficult it becomes to tell. House intelligence committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., has already suggested he might move on to the State Department, or to other targets in more memos.Trump's irritation suggests he may think it's time to turn the page.From a distance, Congress looks monolithic, but it contains worlds within worlds. People in the House don't necessarily like people in the Senate and vice versa, for example. The House goes fast and the Senate goes slow. The committees that authorize spending don't like the committees that appropriate money. And so forth.Against that backdrop, it isn't surprising when, for example, leaders or committees in the different chambers feud over drafting a bill or solving a problem in different ways.The House and Senate intelligence committees, however, were supposed to be different. Created after Watergate to take stronger control over the often infamous spy agencies, they were supposed to be bipartisan and collegial even when the rest of Congress wasn't.Then came the Russia imbroglio.The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has, in the view of critics, become just as much of a circus as the rest of the House. And while the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has retained much of its longtime fustiness and secrecy, cracks are beginning to appear — and it has not proven immune from spillover craziness either.When Senate intelligence committee vice chairman Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., unsuccessfully tried to get in touch with former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, author of the infamous dossier, Warner shared his efforts with the rest of the panel.But then someone on the Senate committee told the House committee about that outreach, which then told Fox News, which then ran a story that sought to tie in Warner with ""a Russian oligarch lobbyist.""The New York Times then told the story of that story.Warner and the intelligence committee's chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., went so far as to complain about Nunes to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.Longtime aficionados will recall they are not the first to make such complaints — Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray also made a visit to the speaker's office to complain about Nunes ahead of February's memo mania.All of this — leaks about leaks, intra-congressional strife, mega-skulduggery — is business as usual for much of Washington, D.C. That it has engulfed the intelligence committees, however, suggests that the last refuge is gone.In an ideal world, reporters and the public shouldn't have to be amateur intelligence analysts, piecing together elements to form a ""mosaic"" about the workings of their own government.That is how we are living our lives now, however, and some of the biggest areas missing from the picture are about the 2016 cyberattacks.The Department of Homeland Security says a number of state election systems were targeted. In at least one — Illinois — Russian hackers got in, but no one believes they did any harm. No vote tallies were affected, officials say.Yet estimates about the number of states affected have fluctuated from both official sources and via background quotes in press reports. NBC News said on Wednesday that seven states were ""compromised"" by Russian attacks. DHS fired back saying the story was wrong. NBC fired back saying DHS was wrong.Who's right? There's no way to know, as NPR's Miles Parks wrote this week — there is still no official box score for this game or final report that gives a definitive narrative.There also doesn't seem to be any good answer for when someone, whether it's Mueller, another federal agency or one of the congressional committee, will publish one."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/01/590076949/depth-of-russian-politicians-cultivation-of-nra-ties-revealed","Updated at 10:25 p.m. ETA prominent Kremlin-linked Russian politician has methodically cultivated ties with leaders of the National Rifle Association and documented efforts in real time over six years to leverage those connections and gain deeper access into American politics, NPR has learned.Russian politician Alexander Torshin said his ties to the NRA provided him access to Donald Trump — and the opportunity to serve as a foreign election observer in the United States during the 2012 election.Torshin is a prolific Twitter user, logging nearly 150,000 tweets, mostly in Russian, since his account was created in 2011. Previously obscured by language and sheer volume of tweets, Torshin has written numerous times about his connections with the NRA, of which he is a known paid lifetime member. NPR has translated a selection of those posts that document Torshin's relationship to the group.These revelations come amid news that the FBI is investigating whether Torshin, the deputy governor of the Bank of Russia, illegally funneled money to the NRA to assist the Trump campaign in 2016, McClatchy reported in January.In a letter to Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a member of the Senate intelligence committee, the NRA denied any wrongdoing and suggested the FBI is investigating Torshin, not the NRA. Neither the NRA nor Torshin responded to inquiries from NPR.Investigations by Congress and the Department of Justice have revealed that the Russian government has sought to sharpen political divisions among American citizens by amplifying controversial social issues. Investigators have expressed concern about Russian links to the NRA, one of the most politically polarizing organizations in the U.S.Torshin is a former Russian senator and served as the deputy speaker of Russia's parliament for more than a decade. Known as a Putin ally, he also spent time on Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee, a state body that includes the director of Russia's internal security service and the ministers of defense, interior and foreign affairs.Translation of November 2016 tweet: ""For 15 years, I've traveled to the U.S. with official delegations, and more often — privately. In this time, I NEVER HEARD ONE BAD WORD ABOUT RUSSIA!""Torshin's use of NRA connections to open doors, and his 2015 claim to know Trump through the organization, raise new questions about the group's connections with Russian officials — at a time when the organization is being roundly criticized by its opponents, and at times the president himself, for opposition to gun control.The president has also defended the group in recent days as the gun debate has re-emerged following a Florida school shooting, including a tweet calling the group's leaders ""Great American Patriots.""The NRA has been a key part of Trump's conservative base. After a meeting with lawmakers in which Trump angered many conservatives for entertaining proposals for gun control, the president tweeted that he had another meeting with NRA leaders in the Oval Office on Thursday night.On his verified Twitter account, Torshin talked about how he knew Trump through the NRA, citing a connection at the group's 2015 convention. Responding to a tweet about comedian Larry David accusing Trump of being a racist, Torshin said he knew the businessman through the NRA, and he defended him.Translation of November 2015 tweet: ""A comedian should make people laugh! Right? So he is trying! I know D. Trump (through NRA). A decent person.""""I saw him in Nashville"" in April 2015, Torshin added later, the date and site of the NRA's 2015 convention. Trump gave a speech at that convention, the outlines of which would become familiar as his stump speech throughout the 2016 presidential campaign. The White House did not respond to repeated requests for comment by NPR but in 2017 denied to Bloomberg News that Trump has ever met Torshin.Among his tens of thousands of tweets, Torshin also documented his attendance at every NRA convention between 2012 and 2016, only some of which have been previously reported.Torshin's attendance at the NRA convention in 2016 is where he reportedly met with Donald Trump Jr.Torshin had made repeated attempts to meet with Donald Trump himself at that convention during the presidential election year, but there is no evidence of this occurring. A conservative activist with ties to Torshin aide Maria Butina reached out to the Trump campaign in 2016, saying that Russia was ""quietly but actively seeking a dialogue with the U.S."" and would try to use the NRA convention to make ""first contact,"" the New York Times reported.""Putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,"" the activist, Paul Erickson, wrote. ""He wants to extend an invitation to Mr. Trump to visit him in the Kremlin before the election."" Erickson has business ties to Butina, having started an LLC with her in South Dakota.Torshin has used his repeated trips to NRA conventions to cultivate relationships with top NRA officials. And his Twitter account documents that he has personally met with every person who has been president of the NRA since 2012.On Twitter, Torshin portrayed these meetings as more than merely casual encounters. In 2017, he tweeted that he was bringing a gift to then-NRA President Allan Cors and suggested he was familiar with Cors' hobbies.Translation of January 2017 tweet: ""Bought a gift for NRA President Allan Cors. Tanks are his favorite topic!""Cors is the founder of the Virginia Museum of Military Vehicles, according to its website.In a public Dropbox album that Torshin linked to from his Twitter account, he is seen meeting with former NRA President Jim Porter as well as another former NRA president, David Keene.His tweets suggest a longtime relationship with Keene, who repeatedly appears in photos as Torshin documents his visits, suggesting that their meeting was not merely coincidental. Keene did not respond to a request for comment.Torshin has also met the current president of the NRA, Pete Brownell, who was part of an NRA delegation that visited Moscow in 2015.These relationships that he cultivated appeared to open another door. Torshin came to the United States in 2012 as an international election observer and watched as ballots were cast during the Obama-Romney presidential contest in Tennessee. This was possible, he wrote, because of his NRA links.Translation of January 2015 tweet: ""I was there at Obama's last election! The NRA card, to me as an observer from Russia, opened access to any [polling] station.""""Tennessee resident Kline Preston requested Mr. Torshin to be an international observer in November 2012,"" Adam Ghassemi, a spokesman for the Tennessee secretary of state, told NPR. The Washington Post reported last year that Preston, a Tennessee lawyer, was the one who originally introduced Torshin to Keene back in 2011.The heat is on the Russian politician, who was alleged by Spanish police to have directed financial transactions for the Russian mob. Not only is the FBI reportedly investigating him — the bureau declined to comment for this story — but lawmakers involved in congressional investigations have also expressed interest in Torshin.Both the Senate and House intelligence committees are currently engaged in investigations into potential ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee and a member of the Senate intelligence committee, has demanded that the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network hand over documents related to Torshin and the NRA.""The NRA and its related entities do not accept funds from foreign persons or entities in connection with United States elections,"" NRA General Counsel John Frazer wrote in response to a request from Wyden to turn over documents related to transactions between the NRA and Russian citizens. ""NRA political decisions are made by NRA officers and executive staff, all of whom are United States citizens. No foreign nationals are consulted in any way on these decisions.""Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, told NPR this week that the committee's members have asked relevant witnesses about the NRA through the course of their investigation.""I can't go into what we've been able to learn thus far on that issue. I can tell you it's one of deep concern to me and to other members of the committee, that we get to the bottom of these allegations that the Russians may have sought to funnel money through the NRA,"" Schiff said. ""It would be negligent of us not to investigate.""Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of research firm Fusion GPS, alluded to Torshin and the NRA during his closed-door testimony before the House intelligence committee in November.""It appears the Russians, you know, infiltrated the NRA. And there is more than one explanation for why,"" Simpson told lawmakers. ""But I would say broadly speaking, it appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations. And they targeted various conservative organizations, religious and otherwise, and they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the NRA.""Not only are congressional investigators interested in the NRA's relationship with Russia, but this inquiry comes as the NRA is receiving additional pressure from groups hoping to pass more gun restrictions into law and as dozens of American companies have cut ties with the organization in response to the Parkland, Fla., shooting last month.""These revelations suggest that for years the NRA courted a top Putin ally who is now reportedly attracting scrutiny from the FBI,"" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, told NPR. ""NRA leaders still haven't explained their close relationship with Russian officials in Putin's orbit. Until they do, people will continue to wonder what the NRA is hiding.""NPR's Alina Selyukh and Audrey McNamara contributed to this story."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/02/590308832/who-wants-to-arm-teachers-republican-men","Guns have dominated politics this week. And the one idea President Trump keeps coming back to is arming teachers.But a new NPR/Ipsos poll found that really only one group of people are in favor of training teachers to carry guns in schools — Republicans, especially Republican men.Overall, 59 percent of Americans are opposed to arming teachers, according to the poll.But about two-thirds (68 percent) of Republicans are in favor of it.Republican men, in particular, poll the highest of every subgroup — 71 percent of them would like to see teachers armed.Republican women also like the idea — 64 percent are in favor.On the opposite end of that spectrum, the least likely to support arming teachers are Democratic women — 86 percent of them are against it. Overall, 82 percent of Democrats don't think it's a good idea, and 60 percent of independents are also against it.What's more, Americans say arming teachers is the least likely way to prevent school shootings — behind stricter gun laws, metal detectors, hiring more school counselors or having armed guards.So there is a huge partisan divide on this issue, and once again, on yet another policy issue, it's the president talking to his base and not much beyond that.At a meeting with lawmakers on Wednesday, Trump indicated an openness to ideas favored by Democrats, too, though. He has expressed support for raising the gun-purchasing age to 21 and seemed open to measures favored by liberal Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who are pushing for reinstating the 1990s-era assault weapons ban and tackling domestic violence, respectively.But he met with the NRA Thursday night at the White House, saying it was a ""Good (Great) meeting.""Chris Cox, the executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, retweeted Trump and said Trump and Vice President Pence ""don't want gun control.""If Trump is indeed backing away from more gun control measures, it's similar to what he did on immigration and DACA, or the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He had called for a bipartisan solution for immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally but came to the country as children. Ultimately, though, he told lawmakers any such legislation would also need to include funding for his border wall and curbs on legal immigration. None of the proposed bills mustered enough votes to pass the Senate.So, on yet another culturally sensitive issue for his base, Trump appears to be backing away from a more bipartisan approach. (Trump has largely maintained his 37 to 42 percent average approval rating through most of his presidency, because his Republican base has stayed with him.)That might not be surprising, considering it may be what is keeping his approval rating from dipping any lower than it already has.The poll was conducted from Feb. 27-28 with a survey sample of 1,005 adults across the country, chosen randomly from Ipsos's online panel. They were interviewed in English, and the sample includes 351 Democrats, 341 Republicans and 203 independents. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/02/589849342/npr-poll-after-parkland-number-of-americans-who-want-gun-restrictions-grows","An increasing number of Americans, both Republicans and Democrats, want more gun regulation, according to a new NPR/Ipsos poll that surveyed people in the aftermath of the Parkland school shooting.Three-quarters of people polled said gun laws should be stricter than they are today. That's an increase — in a short period of time — from October 2017, when NPR conducted a similar survey in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting. Then, 68 percent said gun laws should be stricter than they were.The poll also found widespread bipartisan support for a range of gun-control policies, including:The only policy intended to curb gun violence that is opposed by a majority of Americans (59 percent) is the one most frequently touted by President Trump — the idea of training teachers to carry guns in schools.The poll also found that while nearly every gun policy was supported by a majority of both Republicans and Democrats, the one exception was arming teachers.There was a clear-cut partisan gulf — 68 percent of Republicans favored the idea of training teachers to carry guns compared to just 18 percent of Democrats. Arming teachers was by far the most polarizing policy suggestion; the poll found a 50-point divide between Republicans and Democrats.Trump's in sync with his baseThe president's outspoken criticism of schools as gun-free zones and his recent rhetoric calling for a comprehensive gun bill suggests he's acutely aware of how his base voters feel about gun policies — and the growing desire, even among Republicans, for some sort of stricter gun-control legislation.""We see in this study, a majority of Republicans saying that they are supportive of a variety of different gun-control measures, many of which Trump mentioned explicitly in his [White House] briefing,"" said Chris Jackson, director of the public polling team at Ipsos. ""And that's in contrast to a lot of Republican elected officials, who have taken a much more Second Amendment absolutist stance.""Although Trump remains friendly with the National Rifle Association and its leadership, he's recently shown a willingness to challenge GOP orthodoxy on guns.In a televised White House meeting with legislators Wednesday, Trump surprised (and angered) many of his fellow conservative lawmakers with his ad-hoc approach to gun-control policy. He questioned his fellow Republicans' relationship with the NRA and dismissed a concealed carry provision that conservatives wanted as a trade-off for some restrictions.""They have great power over you people. They have less power over me,"" Trump told GOP lawmakers at that meeting, adding, ""Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified.""Trump suggested he was open to expanding background checks and possibly raising the age to purchase an AR-15. (Both popular measures, according to the NPR/Ipsos poll).""President Trump is actually closer to where the Republican base is on the issue of guns than a lot of Republican elected officials,"" Jackson said. ""And I think this is something that Trump has done a lot through his political career; he often times finds himself closer to the Republican base than the establishment does.""Of course, the president has a history of adopting popular opinions and speaking to the polls, and then subsequently reversing his position and reverting to a more traditionally conservative attitude, as he did with his initial support for a bill that would protect DACA recipients from deportation.Americans want Congress to actAny hope for a quick legislative answer to the gun debate fell apart in the Senate Thursday. And although the Senate now has no plans to vote on gun legislation in the near future, the NPR/Ipsos poll finds that a majority of Americans (78 percent) say Congress needs to do more to address gun violence.But the intensity for congressional action lies with the Democrats — 93 percent of whom want more action, compared to 68 percent among Republicans.Jackson said the biggest change he's noticed since the October survey is the overall importance people are giving to the gun debate. Crime/gun violence is now the No. 1 issue worrying Americans. (Last October, it was terrorism).The shift since last fall is largely because more Democrats and independents say they're concerned about guns, but Republicans shifted some as well.And the poll found Americans are currently saying guns will be an important factor in their vote this November. Roughly two-thirds, or 63 percent, said so.Traditionally, gun control is one of those issues that's dominated by a small slice of the electorate — an energized group of committed gun-rights activists.But the political winds may be shifting.""This data indicates there's actually an increasing energy on the side of gun control,"" Jackson said. And ""given that guns have become very partisan, that may have really significant results in the midterms.""And there are signs the NRA's influence among voters may be declining. The NPR survey shows a decreasing number of Americans overall (led by a shift in Democrats' attitudes) said the NRA represents their views — just 36 percent overall down from 43 percent in October.Guns are still partisanThere are still some major disagreements along party lines that reflect the overall gun debate in the country.On the question of whether the country would be safer if more people carried guns, there was a huge divide, for example — 55 percent of Republicans felt the country would be safer, compared to just 15 percent of Democrats.And likewise, when people were asked whether they believed the premise that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun — there was a split along partisan lines — 71 percent of Republicans agreed, compared to 24 percent of Democrats.The split over Trump's handling of the Parkland shooting situation seems to mirror his overall approval rating and shows how much partisanship affects people's perspectives — 71 percent of Republicans approved of how the president handled the aftermath of the school shooting, compared to just 9 percent of Democrats.The poll was conducted from Feb. 27-28 with a survey sample of 1,005 adults across the country, chosen randomly from Ipsos's online panel. They were interviewed in English, and the sample includes 351 Democrats, 341 Republicans and 203 independents. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/02/589845319/national-weather-service-forecast-cloudy-with-a-chance-of-budget-cuts","Last year, according to government figures, there were 16 ""climate disaster events"" with losses exceeding $1 billion each in the U.S.So the weather is something to keep an eye on, and since 1870 what's now known as the National Weather Service has been doing that. But for the last several years, it's been doing so with serious staff shortages.Now, it faces the prospect of permanent job losses.The Trump administration wants to eliminate 355 jobs, and $75 million from the weather service budget.""The straw is close to breaking the camel's back right now,"" says Daniel Sobien, president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization. ""That will break the camel's back.""Sobien says there are vacant positions across the board. ""Tsunami warning centers are understaffed; the weather forecast centers are understaffed,"" he says, and places like the hurricane center and storm predictions center ""are having big vacancy problems, too.""The employees organization represents some 2,500 weather service workers. And Sobien says right now, 10 percent of the jobs at the service are vacant.The weather service has offices covering ""a quarter of the globe,"" Sobien says, from Guam and American Samoa to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Caribou, Maine.Mark Pellerito, a meteorologist and union shop steward at the Binghamton, N.Y., office, says they're down five positions out of 18 total jobs. Weather doesn't take a day off, he notes. The office needs to be staffed 24/7, meaning long hours, a lot of overtime and a family-work balance that is out of whack. ""As much as we love our job, which we really do,"" Pellerito says, ""this is something we've been passionate about since kindergarten."" But, he says, ""we love our families, too, and not seeing them makes it pretty difficult.""Overworked meteorologists can also put the public at risk. Tired people make mistakes, and Pellerito says the National Weather Service is no different. ""Perhaps we're stretched thin and we miss a warning. If you're the one who didn't quite get to your basement in time because of that one- to two-minute delay, it dramatically impacts your life.""Gary Szatkowski, now retired, was the meteorologist in charge at the Mount Holly, N.J., office, which provided forecasts for the Philadelphia area, and compares the staffing shortage to driving down the highway with bald tires. ""I couldn't tell you whether you're going to get a flat tire in the next mile or you might drive another 500 or a thousand miles on bald tires and not have a problem,"" he says. ""But it's a risky behavior and that's unfortunately the place the operations staff for the National Weather Service has been put in for a number of years.""The Commerce Department, which oversees the National Weather Service, declined to provide a spokesperson for an interview. But in an email, an official said the service plans to hire 80 additional meteorologists by April 1 to address the current staff shortage, and it is working to speed the hiring process, including expedited background checks.The official said under the proposed budget, the National Weather Service would ""begin implementing a series of operational reforms aimed at increasing staffing flexibility,"" which could mean ""reducing operational hours at various offices while maintaining meteorological services through collaboration with other NWS offices,"" and ""making better use of collaborative forecast processes, technological innovation, and a more efficient forecaster career path.""The official says that while the fiscal year 2019 budget would reduce positions by 355, this equates to 217 full-time employees.Still, Sobien says some offices, including those in San Francisco and Tampa, will have to close on nights and weekends with the result there will be ""really no coverage there."" He added, ""another office will look at the weather for them. It's a dangerous idea. They're risking peoples lives.""It's not clear what Congress will do with the proposed Trump budget. But weather service employees worry more cuts on top of current staff shortages will create the perfect storm at an agency that has been trusted and relied on."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/03/02/589921130/science-provides-few-facts-on-effects-of-gun-policies-report-finds","An analysis published Friday confirms the state of American gun policy science is not good, overall.The nonprofit RAND Corporation analyzed thousands of studies and found only 63 that establish a causal relationship between specific gun policies and outcomes such as reductions in homicide and suicide, leaving lawmakers without clear facts about one of the most divisive issues in American politics.The analysis is notable for its depth, if not for its overall finding — RAND spent two years and $1 million dollars on the project, which, beyond the analysis, also included a survey of gun policy experts and the construction of a research database on state gun laws. For decades, social scientists and other researchers have pointed to a profound, and purposeful, lack of federal funding for gun research and a lack of federal data-gathering on guns as enormous impediments to studying gun violence. The federal government has spent much less on research into gun violence than on similarly lethal issues, such as motor vehicle crashes, liver disease and sepsis.""Most of the effects that we were looking for evidence on, we didn't find any evidence,"" says Andrew Morral, a behavioral scientist at RAND and the leader of the project.They found, for example, no clear evidence regarding the effects of any gun policies on hunting and recreational gun use, or on officer-involved shootings, or on mass shootings or on the defensive use of guns by civilians.There were some categories with better data, however, Morral says. There is relatively strong evidence, for example, that policies meant to prevent children from getting access to firearms — such as laws that require guns to be stored unloaded, or in locked containers — reduce both suicide and unintentional injury and death.Previous work has also found that places that require a permit (issued by law enforcement) for the purchase a firearm do reduce violent crime.There is also some evidence that prohibitions against purchase by people who have been diagnosed with mental illness reduce violent crime, and that ""stand your ground"" laws, which allow citizens who feel threatened in public to use lethal force without retreating first, lead to an increase in violent crime.In general, however, good studies were few and far between, the RAND researchers say.To help bridge the data gap for scientists, RAND has now compiled an open-source database of state-by-state gun laws going back to 1979. A similar, unrelated database run out of Boston University was published last year.""Given the lack of data in the firearm research field, [the RAND database] will be a welcome addition, and I'm sure it will be valuable to researchers,"" says Dr. Michael Siegel, the physician who leads the Boston University project. He notes that, since it launched, the Boston database has been most helpful for journalists writing about gun violence.""It's funny because I didn't actually think about that as a purpose of the project when we started it,"" says Siegel, ""but it seems to have become the primary use of the database so far (in addition to use by other researchers).""The RAND team also surveyed 95 gun policy experts from across the political spectrum about what they thought the effects of 15 different gun policies would be on 12 outcomes. The policies included universal background checks, bans on the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, expanded mental illness prohibitions, minimum age requirements and required reporting of lost or stolen weapons.Many of the policies are now being considered by state and federal lawmakers, after a man used an AR-15-style rifle to kill 17 people at a Florida high school in February.The vast majority of the specialists RAND surveyed agreed that the primary objectives of gun policies should be reducing suicides and homicides, and that protecting privacy, enabling hunting and sport shooting and preventing mass shootings were secondary priorities.""That was a surprise, actually,"" says Morral. ""I think people on either side of gun policy debates think that the other side has misplaced values — or that it's a values problem, in any case. But that's not what we find. We find people prioritize the same things in the same order.""However, those surveyed varied widely in their predictions about how different policies would affect each outcome.""Where they disagree is on which laws will achieve those those objectives. So this is a disagreement about facts,"" says Morral. ""And the facts are sparse."""

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/01/589880256/planned-parenthood-plans-major-political-effort-in-key-states-for-2018-midterms","Add Planned Parenthood to the list of organizations looking to take advantage of President Trump's low approval ratings in the 2018 midterm elections.The organization is not new to the rough-and-tumble of electoral politics — and has often itself become a top issue for Republicans looking to slash federal funding for the organization — but this year Planned Parenthood Votes and Planned Parenthood Action Fund will launch their biggest-ever push to try to tip the balance in Congress and in key states.Planned Parenthood sees the Trump administration as a threat and, with a Republican-controlled Congress, sees the danger to abortion rights as great as it has been in decades. But the upside for progressive groups is that Trump has also inspired a newly energized movement in protest of his policies. The best example of this so far is the massive Women's March on Washington, D.C., a year ago, a day after Trump's inauguration, and the hundreds of smaller marches across the country on that day and since.Deirdre Schifeling, executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes, which along with Planned Parenthood Action Fund constitutes Planned Parenthood's political operation, says the group has committed an initial investment of $20 million to be used mostly on Senate and gubernatorial contests in eight states.""We will be supporting candidates who support reproductive rights,"" Schifeling says, adding that such rights are ""really at stake in the country, especially this year."" She says ""we support candidates who support access to Planned Parenthood and who support women and all people making their own health care decisions without interference from politicians.""Federal funding for Planned Parenthood — which is not an actual line item in the budget, but rather reimbursement for health care services provided to patients — has become a perpetual political battle in Washington. Republicans in Congress have long made ending any federal dollars for the organization a campaign issue. But so far, the funding survives.Planned Parenthood's target list of states includes Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all of which were instrumental in Trump's 2016 victory. The others where Planned Parenthood will pour in money and resources are Arizona, Florida, Minnesota and Nevada — each of which has hotly contested races.Notably, states so far not on the Planned Parenthood target list are two of the more conservative states, each of which has an incumbent Democratic senator on the ballot this year: Missouri and North Dakota. Both are states Trump won easily and where protecting abortion rights is a more difficult case to make with a more conservative populace.This year's Planned Parenthood spending will mostly fund a network of grass-roots volunteers to reach out to voters where health care and the right to an abortion are considered important. That likely means a focus on suburbs and female voters. Schifeling says there will be a ""robust door-to-door canvassing operation,"" but she adds that ""we will also be investing in paid digital and some paid TV [advertising] in key races.""Voter turnout will be the key. The money being committed this year is already $5 million greater than the $15 million Planned Parenthood spent on the 2014 midterm elections.Meanwhile, groups that oppose abortion rights are also expected to be active in many of the same states. The Susan B. Anthony List is one such organization. It has not released a dollar amount for its 2018 political operations, but it too will fund an aggressive door-to-door campaign in key states including Ohio, Florida and Missouri. Part of the argument these groups will use is that Trump has been their friend, that he named a solid conservative, Justice Neil Gorsuch, to the Supreme Court and that such gains need to be protected.For Planned Parenthood, a lesson of 2017 — when voter discontent over the Trump presidency helped fuel a swing of 16 seats in the Virginia House of Delegates from Republicans to Democrats and a near Democratic takeover — is that there are opportunities."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/01/589397317/repeal-the-second-amendment-thats-not-so-simple-here-s-what-it-would-take","""The Second Amendment.""If you've lived in America, you've heard those words spoken with feeling.The feeling may have been forceful, even vehement.""Why? The Second Amendment, that's why.""The same words can be heard uttered in bitterness, as if in blame.""Why? The Second Amendment, that's why.""Or then again, with reverence, an invocation of the sacred — rather like ""the Second Coming.""Talk of gun rights and gun control is back on full boil after 17 people were killed in the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, so the conversation turns to the Second Amendment quickly and often.We are talking, of course, about the Second Amendment to U.S. Constitution, in the Bill of Rights.It reads in full:Simple. And not simple. Assuming it means just what it says, just what does it actually say?Scholars have parsed the words, and courts and lawyers have argued over their meaning. Historians have debated what was meant by ""well-regulated militia"" back in 1789.Some say the framers only meant to protect well-organized militias in the respective states, forerunners of today's National Guard. Others say the framers also intended to shield the guns of individuals, the weapons they would use if those militias were called upon to fight.Heller brings some clarityTo some extent, the issue was clarified, if not settled, by the Heller decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008. The 5-4 decision held that the Second Amendment meant individuals had an inherent right to own guns for lawful purposes.Heller applied that standard to overturn a ban on privately held handguns, enacted in the District of Columbia. But the same basic reasoning has also been used to defend the private ownership of AR-15-type rifles such as the one used in Parkland and other mass shootings in recent years.Congress tried to ban ""assault-style"" weapons in 1994 but put a 10-year sunset provision in the law. It survived court challenges at the time, but when the 10-year term had passed, the majority control of Congress had also passed — from the Democrats, who had enacted the ban, to the Republicans, who let it lapse.Since then, all efforts to restrict the sale of such weapons have failed. Even relatively bipartisan attempts at strengthening other restrictions, such as the Manchin-Toomey background check expansion bill in 2013, have fallen short of the necessary supermajority needed for passage in the Senate.It was not, as President Trump alleged Wednesday, because of a lack of ""presidential backup."" President Barack Obama supported the bill, as Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, pointed out to Trump. Republicans filibustered the bill, which got 54 votes.In each case, defenders of gun rights have invoked the Second Amendment, the text that casts a long shadow across all discussions of guns in the U.S. At times, it seems to all but end such discussion.Parkland changes calculusBut now, the tide is running the other way. The Parkland shootings have created a new moment and a new movement, led by teenagers who survived the tragedy and took their protests to social media and beyond.Suddenly, even Trump is tossing out ideas about keeping students safe, arming teachers, restraining gun sales through background checks and higher age limits, and even banning accessories such as ""bump stocks"" that enable nonautomatic weapons to fire rapidly and repeatedly.And it's still unclear what Trump wants exactly. Republicans on Capitol Hill seem flummoxed by Trump's posture.After Trump's made-for-cable bipartisan meeting at the White House with members of Congress, Texas Republican John Cornyn, a leader on gun issues in the Senate, seemed to scratch his head.""I think everybody is trying to absorb what we just heard,"" Cornyn told reporters. ""He's a unique president, and I think if he was focused on a specific piece of legislation rather than a grab bag of ideas, then I think he could have a lot of influence, but right now we don't have that.""He added that he didn't think simply because the president says he supports something that it would pass muster with Republicans. ""I wouldn't confuse what he said with what can actually pass,"" Cornyn said. ""I don't expect to see any great divergence in terms of people's views on the Second Amendment, for example.""Ah, and there are those two words again — Second Amendment.If new restrictions are enacted — a prospect far from certain, as Cornyn rightly points out — they will surely be tested in the courts. There, it will be argued that they infringe on the rights of law-abiding citizens to ""keep and bear"" firearms.In other words, they will run afoul of, that's right, the Second Amendment.Anticipating that, some gun control advocates — and at least one lifelong Republican — want to leap to the ultimate battlement and do it now. They want to repeal, or substantially alter, the formidable amendment itself.That would seem logical, at least to these advocates. If some 70 percent of Americans want more gun control and the Second Amendment stands in their way, why shouldn't they be able to do something about it?Someday, it is conceivable, the people and politicians of the United States may be ready for that. But it will need to be a very different United States than we know today.Why? Because amendments to the Constitution, once ratified, become fully part of the Constitution. Changing or removing them requires a two-stage process that has proved historically difficult.The Founding Fathers were willing to be edited, it seems, but they did not want it to be easy. So they made the amending process a steep uphill climb, requiring a clear national consensus to succeed.Why it takes consensusA proposed amendment to the Constitution must first be passed by Congress with two-thirds majorities in both the House and the Senate.The two chambers have not achieved such a margin for a newly written amendment to the Constitution in nearly half a century. The last such effort was the 26th Amendment (lowering the voting age nationwide from 21 to 18), and it cleared Capitol Hill in March 1971.(There has been another amendment added since, in 1992, but it had been written and approved by Congress literally generations ago. More about that curious ""zombie"" amendment below.)Even after surviving both chambers of Congress in 1971, the 18-year-old vote amendment still had to survive the second stage of the process — the more difficult stage.Just like all the other amendments before it, the new voting age had to be ratified by three-fourths of the states. That is currently at least 38 states. Another way to look at it: If as few as 13 states refuse, the amendment stalls.This arduous process has winnowed out all but a handful of the amendments proposed over the past 230 years. Every Congress produces scores of proposals, sometimes well over 100. The 101st Congress (1989 to 1991) produced 214.Some deal with obscure concerns; many address facets of the electoral process — especially the Electoral College and the choosing of a president. Many are retreads from earlier sessions of Congress. The one thing most have in common is that they never even come to a vote.Two that fell shortIn 1995, a watershed year with big new GOP majorities in both chambers, two major constitutional amendments were brought to votes in the Capitol. One would have imposed term limits on members of Congress. It failed to get even close to two-thirds in the House, so the Senate did not bother.The other proposed amendment would have required the federal government to balance its budget, not in theory down the road but in reality and in real time. It quickly got two-thirds in the House but failed to reach that threshold in the Senate by a single vote (one Republican in the chamber voted no).So even relatively popular ideas with a big head of steam can hit the wall of the amendment process. How much more challenging would it be to tackle individual gun ownership in a country where so many citizens own guns — and care passionately about their right to do so?Overcoming the NRA and other elements of the gun lobby is only the beginning. The real obstacle would be tremendous support for guns in Southern, Western and rural Midwestern states, which would easily total up to more than enough states to block a gun control amendment.There have been six amendments that got the needed margins in House and Senate but not the needed margin of support in the state legislatures. The most recent was the Equal Rights Amendment, a remarkably simple statement (""Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on account of sex"") that cleared Congress with bipartisan support in 1972 and quickly won nods from most of the states.But in the mid-1970s, a resistance campaign began and stymied the ERA in many of the remaining states. The resistance then managed to persuade several states to rescind their ratification votes. With momentum now reversed, the ERA died when its window for ratification closed.Zombie amendmentsOther amendments that met similar fates included one granting statehood to the District of Columbia. Like the ERA, the D.C. amendment had a time limit for ratification that expired. But other amendments sent out for ratification in the past did not have a limit, and so might still be ratified — at least theoretically.The granddaddy of these ""zombie"" amendments was the very first among the Bill of Rights, which began with 12 items rather than 10. The proposed amendment sought to regulate the number of constituents to be represented by a member of the House, and its numbers were soon outdated. So it has never been ratified and presumably will not be.The one other amendment originally proposed in 1789 but not ratified as part of the original 10 amendments sat around for generations. Then it caught the attention of state legislatures in the late 1980s, at a time of popular reaction against pay raises for Congress. This amendment stated that a member of Congress who voted for a pay raise could not receive that raise until after the next election for the House of Representatives.That amendment was dusted off and recirculated, and it reached the ratification threshold in 1992, more than 200 years after it had first been proposed. It is now the 27th Amendment to the Constitution, and the last — at least so far.A new Constitutional Convention?If all this seems daunting, as it should, there is one alternative for changing the Constitution. That is the calling of a Constitutional Convention. This, too, is found in Article V of the Constitution and allows for a new convention to bypass Congress and address issues of amendment on its own.To exist with this authority, the new convention would need to be called for by two-thirds of the state legislatures.So if 34 states saw fit, they could convene their delegations and start writing amendments. Some believe such a convention would have the power to rewrite the entire 1787 Constitution, if it saw fit. Others say it would and should be limited to specific issues or targets, such as term limits or balancing the budget — or changing the campaign-finance system or restricting the individual rights of gun owners.There have been calls for an ""Article V convention"" from prominent figures on the left as well as the right. But there are those on both sides of the partisan divide who regard the entire proposition as suspect, if not frightening.One way or another, any changes made by such a powerful convention would need to be ratified by three-fourths of the states — just like amendments that might come from Congress.And three-fourths would presumably be as high a hurdle for convention-spawned amendments as it has been for those from Congress — dating to the 1700s."

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/business/media/paul-schweizer-google-facebook.html","Conservatives are zeroing in on a new enemy in the political culture wars: Big Tech.Arguing that Silicon Valley is stifling their speech and suppressing right-wing content, publishers and provocateurs on the right are eyeing a public-relations battle against online giants like Google and Facebook, the same platforms they once relied on to build a national movement.In a sign of escalation, Peter Schweizer, a right-wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton, plans to release a new film focusing on technology companies and their role in filtering the news.Tentatively titled “The Creepy Line,” Mr. Schweizer’s documentary is expected to have its first screening in May in Cannes, France — during the Cannes Film Festival, but not as part of the official competition. He used the same rollout two years ago for his previous film, an adaptation of his book “Clinton Cash” that he produced with Stephen K. Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News.“The Creepy Line” alludes to an infamous 2010 speech by Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google at the time, who dismissed concerns about privacy by declaring that his company’s policy was “to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it.”The documentary, which has not been previously reported, dovetails with concerns raised in recent weeks by right-wing groups about censorship on digital media — a new front in a rapidly evolving culture war.If the mainstream media is a perennial enemy of the right, Big Tech is a fresh and novel foe, arguably more relevant to 2018. Facebook, Google and their ilk are facing tough questions about their inability to police the content they distribute, including Russian propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. The companies have also been accused by lawmakers, critics and activists of monopolistic tendencies and manipulative product design.The critique from conservatives, in contrast, casts the big tech companies as censorious and oppressive, all too eager to stifle right-wing content in an effort to mollify liberal critics.“This could end up being the free speech issue of our time,” said Alex Marlow, editor in chief of Breitbart News, which has published articles accusing Google and Facebook of, among other sins, political bias. “The Silicon Valley elites are saying: ‘We don’t care what you want to see — we know what you should see. We know better.’”Big Tech is easily associated with West Coast liberalism and Democratic politics, making it a fertile target for the right. And operational opacity at Facebook, Google and Twitter, which are reluctant to reveal details about their algorithms and internal policies, can leave them vulnerable, too.“It’s the perfect foil,” said Eli Pariser, a former executive director of the liberal activist group MoveOn.org and the author of “The Filter Bubble,” a book about how consumers find information online. “There’s not even a real basis to establish objective research about what’s happening on Facebook, because it’s closed.”Google, Facebook and Twitter loomed large at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., where dozens of guests squeezed into a standing-room-only ballroom for a discussion called “Suppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.”Among the panelists were James O’Keefe, the guerrilla filmmaker who has tried to undermine news outlets like The New York Times, The Washington Post and CNN, and James Damore, an engineer fired by Google after he circulated a memo arguing that biological differences accounted for the low number of women in engineering.Mr. Damore — a new celebrity in the right-wing world, who, in an interview, said of his first foray to CPAC, “There’s definitely a lot of people that want to take selfies” — described a culture of dogmatic liberalism at Google.“There are political activists in all of these companies that want to actively push a liberal agenda,” he said. “Why does it matter? Because these companies are so ubiquitous and powerful that they are controlling all the means of mass communication.”Before Mr. Damore spoke, organizers distributed baseball caps to guests emblazoned with an illustration of Twitter’s bird logo, upside-down and with its eyes crossed out.The panelists accused social media platforms of delisting their videos or stripping them of advertising. Such charges have long been staples of far-right online discourse, especially among YouTubers, but Mr. Schweizer’s project is poised to bring such arguments to a new — and potentially larger — audience.Mr. Schweizer, 53, was a speechwriting consultant to President George W. Bush. His reporting has been cited by The Times and “60 Minutes,” although he often uses a bombastic style akin to that of Breitbart News.He is also the president of the Government Accountability Institute, a conservative nonprofit organization. He and Mr. Bannon founded it with funding from the family of Robert Mercer, the billionaire hedge fund manager and donor to Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign.Mr. Schweizer declined to identify the film’s financial backers. A spokeswoman for the institute said it was not involved in the project.In some ways, the complaints from the right about Big Tech mirror the grumblings of legacy news organizations, which have expressed concern that online algorithms wield too much power over how readers gain access to their content.Jeffrey A. Zucker, the president of CNN, derided Google and Facebook as “monopolies” and called for regulators to step in during a speech in Spain last month, saying the tech hegemony is “the biggest issue facing the growth of journalism in the years ahead.” And former President Barack Obama said at an off-the-record conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last month that he worried Americans were living in “entirely different realities” and that large tech companies like Facebook were “not just an invisible platform, they’re shaping our culture in powerful ways.” The contents of the speech were published by Reason magazine.In the right’s more internet-savvy quarters, tech platforms have been a regular — and fruitful — subject of discussion since before the 2016 election. In May that year, Facebook was forced to respond to claims that the curators of its Trending Topics feature had suppressed conservative news sources, a controversy that called attention to Facebook’s editorial power.That charge of editorial bias was echoed last weekend by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, who accused YouTube of planning to delete his organization’s account, a claim that was widely shared among conservatives.YouTube did delete some videos that accused teenage survivors of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting of being “crisis actors,” and it issued “strikes,” or warnings, to the accounts of Infowars and Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and Infowars contributor. (YouTube denied that it had plans to delete the Infowars account.)Facebook has also caught flak for adjusting  the algorithm for its News Feed to emphasize posts from “friends, family and groups” over content from public pages. The change was part of an effort by the company to answer criticism, but also to reinvigorate its oldest and most profitable product, which recently recorded a decline in American daily users for the first time in its history.The Facebook adjustment has affected virtually every media organization that is partly dependent on the platform for audiences, but it appears to have hit some harder than others. They include right-wing sites like Gateway Pundit and the millennial-focused Independent Journal Review, which was forced to lay off staff members last month.The social news giant BuzzFeed recently bought ads on Facebook with the message, “Facebook is taking the news out of your News Feed, but we’ve got you covered,” directing users to download its app. Away from the political scrum, the viral lifestyle site LittleThings, once a top publisher on the platform, announced last week that it would cease operations, blaming “a full-on catastrophic update” to Facebook’s revised algorithms.Right-wing media has pounced. In late February, citing statistics from the social analytics firm NewsWhip, Breitbart published an article on the effects on the president’s Facebook page with the headline “EXCLUSIVE: Trump’s Facebook Engagement Declined By 45 Percent Following Algorithm Change.” The drop, the article insinuated, occurred “following a year of pressure from left-wing employees and the mainstream media for ‘allowing’ the president to win the 2016 general election.”Still, the brewing backlash did not stop Google and Facebook from courting the very crowd that now seems ready to declare them enemies. Both companies were sponsors at this year’s CPAC, leading to a few awkward moments.Facebook, which sponsored a “help desk” for attendees featuring smiling representatives and cookies frosted with emoji icons, provided a demonstration of its virtual reality program, Oculus. But the company was forced to apologize for including a first-person shooter simulation, given that the conference took place a week after the Parkland massacre.Google, which has co-sponsored CPAC three of the past six years, held a lavish reception for attendees featuring an open bar and a roaring outdoor fireplace.Mr. Marlow, the editor of Breitbart, was asked in an interview what he thought about Google’s giving a party in the midst of a crowd that is gunning for it.“The least they can do,” Mr. Marlow said, “is buy us a drink.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/nyregion/as-jurors-decide-fate-of-key-cuomo-ally-political-verdict-may-be-in.html","For Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the political damage, it seems, is already done.Over the last six weeks, federal prosecutors in Manhattan unspooled a streaming spectacle of unflattering tales of how Mr. Cuomo, 60, conducts himself and how his administration has conducted the people’s business in Albany.Witnesses and court records told stories of the governor’s pitching a screaming fit after an upstate development deal fell through; allowing Joseph Percoco, a former top aide and confidant who is one of four defendants on trial, to continue to use a state office and phone while he served as his campaign manager in 2014; being cajoled into talking cars, for a half-hour, with an executive of a company now accused of trying to bribe Mr. Percoco to do their bidding.State election laws were ignored or flouted, critics say, and campaign finance rules exploited to allow Mr. Cuomo’s donors to use multiple, anonymous companies to give amply to his coffers, a practice urged on by a longtime Cuomo associate.The governor has not been accused of illegal acts, and prosecutors and the federal judge in charge of the case, Judge Valerie E. Caproni, have stressed that the donations in question were legal. . Nonetheless, the corruption trial, which enters its fourth day of jury deliberations on Tuesday, may well tarnish the well-groomed reputation of Mr. Cuomo, a second-term Democrat facing re-election in the fall. It may also complicate or undercut any national ambitions, which would need to take flight in places like Iowa and New Hampshire next year.“Any time a close adviser or aide is charged with corruption reflects badly on a politician,” said Ben Tulchin, a pollster for Bernie Sanders during his presidential race. “It’s even worse if it’s New York: Voters in the heartland already have a jaded view of New York politics and politicians.”Other major Albany corruption trials will soon follow, including those of Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who was the longtime Assembly speaker, and Dean G. Skelos, a Republican who was the Senate majority leader. Both men are being retried after their convictions were overturned on appeal last year.In June, another former Cuomo ally, Alain E. Kaloyeros, the former president of the State University’s Polytechnic Institute, is to go on trial in yet another corruption case. The trial of Mr. Kaloyeros, who the governor once said was “as close as I’ve ever come to dealing with a genius,” involves bid-rigging in Mr. Cuomo’s signature upstate economic plan, the Buffalo Billion.There are some indications that the Percoco trial has hurt Mr. Cuomo’s popularity. A Quinnipiac University poll in mid-February found him with an approval rating of 47 percent. A whopping 63 percent said Mr. Cuomo should not run for president, including almost half the respondents from his own party.Mr. Cuomo has scrupulously avoided talking about the trial, saying he respects the legal process. He has held noticeably few public events in recent weeks, and has mostly avoided unscripted questions from the press.Democratic strategists said the corruption case was all but assured to be part of Mr. Cuomo’s national introduction, should he run for president, especially if Mr. Percoco were to be found guilty.Those looking to paint Mr. Cuomo as being ethically challenged have the benefit of an indelible catchword from the trial: “ziti,” the much-used code word that the prosecution contends Mr. Percoco and his fellow conspirator used to describe the under-the-table payments he received while serving as Mr. Cuomo’s campaign manager and senior aide.Here in New York, even before the jury returns its verdict, a collection of government watchdog groups have issued a scathing assessment of what-we-learned-at-trial, calling out “stunning failures in New York’s ethics oversight system” under Governor Cuomo. The groups also demanded answers to a series of questions raised by the trial, including why “so many high ranking officials were allowed to conduct business through personal emails,” something illustrated, again and again, during testimony.Indeed, the trial reinforced the Capitol’s shoddy reputation for ethics, something Mr. Cuomo promised to fix when he first ran for governor in 2010. Even then, however, the governor seemed willing to take advantage of donor’s generosity: testimony at trial showed that Mr. Cuomo, in the closing days of that campaign, used a private plane from a company, Competitive Power Ventures, r later accused of bribing Mr. Percoco. An executive with another company involved in the scandal, COR Development, a Syracuse-area developer, wooed Mr. Cuomo with talk of Corvettes at a fund-raiser for him, knowing his affinity for those sports cars.The Percoco trial also shed light on the use of sometimes shadowy limited liability companies to flood money into state campaigns, including those of Mr. Cuomo, who has been a major beneficiary of the so-called “L.L.C. loophole.” In one instance, the government’s star witness, Todd R. Howe, showed how COR, a company with business before the state, purposefully split contributions — and used nondescript names on the L.L.C.s — to hide their origin.While those activities were legal, the disclosures have been met with glee by the governor’s opponents, in particular the beleaguered state Republican Party.In a post on Twitter, Mr. Cuomo’s most outspoken Republican opponent, State Senator John DeFrancisco, said the trial illustrated how Mr. Cuomo “has sold his office to the highest bidder, engaging in shakedown schemes, exchanging government contracts for millions in campaign donations.” Mr. DeFrancisco wrote last week, “So pathetic, it would make Boss Tweed blush.”The chairman of the state Republican Party, Edward F. Cox, has asked a state ethics panel to investigate Mr. Cuomo, saying the governor has violated New York Public Officers Law, and has requested the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., to also investigate.Mr. Cox, whose party has not won a statewide election in New York since 2002, saw parallels between Mr. Cuomo’s guilt-by-association and that of former Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, whose proximity to the bridge-closing scandal known as Bridgegate helped dent his national profile.“This is the end of Governor Cuomo’s political future,” Mr. Cox said at a news conference last month before the steps of Federal District Court in Manhattan, where Mr. Percoco is being tried.That may be an overstatement; unlike Mr. Christie, whose former aides implicated him at trial for knowing of the decision to close bridge lanes, Mr. Cuomo has not been similarly besmirched.And officials with the state Democratic party, controlled by Mr. Cuomo, shot back at any suggestion that the governor would be hurt by the Percoco trial.“After years of investigation, there has never been a suggestion that the Governor or anyone else besides the people on trial did anything wrong,” said Geoff Berman, the party’s executive director, calling Mr. DeFrancisco “the Boss Tweed of Albany.”Indeed, with $30 million in the bank and no top-tier opponent in the contest, Mr. Cuomo remains a heavy favorite to win re-election this year. Among Democrats, no serious primary challenger has yet emerged, though two women, the former Syracuse mayor, Stephanie Miner, and the actress Cynthia Nixon, have publicly toyed with running.But if his ambitions extend to the White House in 2020 — and Mr. Cuomo has increasingly framed his agenda in national terms — the trial, especially if it ends in a conviction, threatens to muddy his core argument that he can be a capable and trusted custodian of the state, or especially, the country.“These kinds of things typically emerge either soon after he first announces or soon after he gains traction,” Mr. Tulchin said. “Assuming he gains any.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/climate/bloomberg-un-climate.html","Want the latest climate news in your inbox? You can sign up here to receive Climate Fwd:, our new email newsletter.The United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, on Monday appointed a billionaire politician from New York to be his special envoy for climate action. It amounted to a finger in the eye of another New York billionaire: the one who occupies the White House and who has dismissed the fact of climate change.The appointment of Michael R. Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York City who is a prominent advocate in the fight against climate change, to the United Nations post comes a year ahead of a summit meeting on global warming that the secretary general is planning.“The world has those that follow and those that lead. And those that lead, some lead in the wrong direction and some lead in the right direction,” Mr. Guterres said at a news conference Monday at United Nations headquarters. “You are of those that lead and have always led in the right direction,” he told Mr. Bloomberg, “and it is an enormous privilege for me to be able to work so closely with you.”In a statement, Mr. Guterres said he had asked Mr. Bloomberg to help him encourage governments and private businesses to rapidly reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to meet the targets of the Paris climate accord.“The Secretary General and Michael Bloomberg share the perspective that the emissions gap needs to be closed soon to limit global temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius,” Mr. Guterres’s office said in a statement.President Trump has said the United States will pull out of the Paris climate agreement. He has rolled back a host of regulations to protect the environment, appointed climate science deniers to key posts in the administration and championed the use of fossil fuels, defying the scientific consensus that emissions from those fuels are a major cause of global warming.On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump described climate change as a “hoax.”Mr. Bloomberg, who was mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013, has teamed up with one of Mr. Trump’s most outspoken critics, Gov. Jerry Brown of California, to press cities and states to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions to help the United States meet its Paris agreement targets.“For the United States to reach its commitment, much more needs to be done,” the two wrote in an opinion article published in The New York Times. “But the world should know: We are not waiting for Washington.”Mr. Bloomberg has given tens of millions of dollars to environmental groups fighting coal-fired power plants. In 2014, Ban Ki-moon, who was United Nations secretary general at the time, appointed him special envoy for cities and climate change.“Around the world, bottom-up solutions are leading the fight against climate change,” Mr. Bloomberg said in a Twitter post. “As the new @UN Special Envoy for Climate Action, I’ll work with state and non-state actors to help implement policies that reduce emissions & build resilience.”Mr. Guterres on Monday did not mention the Trump administration, but criticism was implicit in his remarks. How society reacts, he said, will make the difference in winning what he called “the battle against climate change.”“Governments are important, of course, because they can slow down this process, but the essential is the way societies as a whole react, and that is what Michael Bloomberg is leading in an exemplary way,” the secretary general said.Mr. Guterres has described Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris deal as “a major disappointment.” The United States is the only country in the world to have announced its intention to withdraw.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/06/591039154/5-laws-of-political-gravity-in-midterms-do-they-still-apply-in-the-age-of-trump","The 2018 election cycle has officially begun, with the first primaries being held in Texas on Tuesday.In every campaign cycle, analysts look at the fundamentals — the political laws of gravity that, in the past, have influenced elections. In 2016, Donald Trump seemed to defy a lot of these laws, and Republicans are hoping they can do the same this year to prevent the hit that the party in power usually takes in a president's first midterm.Here are five laws of political gravity to watch as the 2018 campaign plays out:1. When a president's approval rating is below 50 percent, his party doesn't fare well at allHistorically, parties that hold the White House lose seats in midterms — even more when they also have complete control of Congress, and even more when the president's approval rating is under 50 percent.The Republican Party has a bad news trifecta here.Since the Great Depression, when a president's approval rating has been below 50 percent in his first midterm, his party has lost an average of 41 House and five Senate seats.Midterms are a referendum on the president and his party. Trump is still popular with his base, but because he is so historically unpopular with so many other voters, his ability to help his fellow Republicans is diminished. His ""strongly disapprove"" numbers have been consistently higher than his ""strongly approve"" numbers.The latest tracking poll from Gallup showed that 39 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing, while 55 percent disapprove. And his approval rating in the RealClearPolitics average is a similar 40 percent approve, 56 percent disapprove.2. The party with the intensity and enthusiasm on its side winsDemocrats have it — and it's fueled by animus toward Trump, just like Republicans in 2010 and 2014 were motivated by antipathy to President Barack Obama. (Democrats lost a total of 76 House seats and 15 Senate seats in those two Obama-era midterms.)In the handful of special elections since 2016, and in the Virginia and New Jersey 2017 elections, Democratic turnout has been up. There are hundreds of new Democratic candidates running in races where Democrats have failed to field a candidate in the past, and polls consistently show that Democrats are more interested and enthusiastic about the 2018 campaign than Republicans.As The Washington Post noted Saturday, about 1,200 candidates had registered to run as Democrats for the House by the end of 2017 — a clear record for a single party and the first time since before the wave election of 2010 that Democrats outnumbered Republicans at the same point in an election cycle.3. When people are in a bad mood, the party in power suffersVoters' attitudes about the state of the country — Are we in a recession? Are we at war? — is always one of the most important factors.Americans remain pessimistic about the direction of the country. On average, just 35 percent think the country is headed in the right direction, while 56 percent think it is on the wrong track.And this year, the measurement isn't working the way it usually does in at least one big respect. The direction of the country and a president's approval rating is typically tied to voters' views about the economy. But right now, the economy is doing pretty well — with Americans' attitudes about the economy reaching a 17-year high in a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll — and increasing numbers of people are saying they like the GOP tax cuts.So why isn't Trump more popular? In fact, he's suffering poor approval ratings with the very upper-middle-class, suburban voters who are probably benefiting the most from his tax cuts.Amy Walter of The Cook Political Report said that it's as if voters are saying to the president, ""Yeah, we feel good about the economy, but we don't really feel good about you.""There is a wild card on the economy — Trump's threatened tariffs and a possible trade war. On Monday, the president said that he didn't think there would be a trade war if he goes ahead with steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, but a few days earlier, he tweeted that ""trade wars are good, and easy to win.""Republicans worry Trump's tariffs could undermine the stock market and economic growth — two factors they have been counting on to help them in November.4. The party that has the structural advantages can sometimes mitigate damageThis is the bright spot for Republicans.Even though many Democratic candidates have raised impressive amounts of money to stock their war chests, Republicans have a lot more outside money than Democrats do. The Koch brothers' network of conservative donors alone have pledged to spend a whopping $400 million electing Republicans this year, 60 percent more than they spent in the 2016 presidential election.Many GOP congressional districts are also drawn to protect incumbents, and because Republicans control more state legislatures, they have overwhelmingly drawn those districts to advantage their party.Republicans are hoping the mighty fortress of redistricting will help them defend against a big blue wave — if one materializes. They are trying to fight back against a state court ruling in Pennsylvania that redrew the state's congressional district and is likely to eat into the GOP's 13-to-5 statewide advantage in House seats. But challenges to maps drawn by Republicans in Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan and North Carolina are unlikely to impact the 2018 election.5. The party that turns out their base usually winsWho actually comes out to vote is an important factor in any election — and it's hard to predict. But it's especially true in midterms, when activists traditionally dominate. Consider: There is about a 30 percent drop off in turnout from presidential to midterm years.In 2016, Donald Trump surprised a lot of political handicappers when he got more rural, white, working-class voters to the polls than most turnout models predicted. And things are often favorable for the GOP in a midterm.""The people who turn out the most tend to be older people, tend to be whiter people, tend to be people who are married, and tend to be people who are well educated,"" says demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution. ""Most of them tend to favor the Republicans.""But there's one flaw in that profile for Republicans — highly educated voters generally do not like Trump. In fact, more than half of white college graduates have strongly disapproved of him. And, since 2016, they have been turning out for Democrats.This will make it harder for Trump to help Republican candidates in the kind of suburban districts won by Hilary Clinton in 2016. The suburbs are precisely where Democrats are hoping to build their comeback. Clinton won 23 districts where a Republican was elected to the House in 2016. Democrats need to pick up a net of 24 seats to take back the House.What's more, Trump won independents in 2016, but they've flipped.To make up for it, Trump needs to turn out big numbers of his white, non-college-educated supporters to the polls this year — just like he did when he defied the odds two years ago.""Coalitions that are built in presidential elections don't always translate into midterm elections,"" Walter points out. ""Just ask Democrats who were counting on the Obama coalition of 2008 to come out in 2010. They didn't."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/05/591001865/ex-trump-campaign-aide-vows-to-fight-mueller-subpoena-in-tv-tirades","Updated on March 6 at 11:45 a.m. ETA former campaign aide to Donald Trump appears to have changed his mind and will not fight a subpoena he says he has received in the Russia investigation — after daring special counsel Robert Mueller to arrest him in multiple media appearances.Sam Nunberg called reporters and TV news programs on Monday and said live that he'd gotten a grand jury subpoena as part of Mueller's investigation asking for communications with other people in the Trump orbit — but that he would not comply.""Let him arrest me,"" Nunberg told The Washington Post. ""Mr. Mueller should understand I am not going in.""Nunberg then went on multiple MSNBC and CNN shows to publicize his refusal to comply with the Mueller probe. He said he had been summoned to appear before a grand jury on Friday but would not, nor would he produce evidence.What followed was a rambling, at-times incoherent series of exchanges as Nunberg asked for legal advice, opined about whether Trump colluded with Russia, and relitigated an internal Trump campaign power struggle from 2015 — all live, on the air, in real time.""I think that [Trump] may have done something during the election,"" Nunberg told MSNBC's Katy Tur, adding later, ""I don't know that for sure.""""I'm not cooperating,"" Nunberg said. ""Arrest me.""Nunberg is a lawyer who has been admitted to the New York state bar after graduating from Touro Law Center on Long Island, N.Y. All the same, he asked for legal advice from various cable news show hosts: ""What do you think Mueller's going to do to me?"" he asked Tur.""Do you think I should cooperate?"" Nunberg asked CNN's Jake Tapper. ""Why do I have to produce every email? I talk to [former Trump advisers] Steve Bannon and Roger Stone eight times a day.""""Sometimes life and special prosecutors are not fair,"" Tapper quipped.Discussing the request from the Mueller team in an interview with the Associated Press later on Monday, Nunberg said he was ""going to end up cooperating with them.""In the Whitewater investigation during the Clinton administration, an Arkansas business associate of Bill Clinton's, Susan McDougal, spent 18 months in prison for not complying with a grand jury subpoena. McDougal spoke about Nunberg to the Washington Post on Monday, advising him, ""If you don't want to testify, don't go on television and do these teaser interviews."" Nunberg also accused former Trump foreign policy adviser Carter Page of having played a role in the foreign attack on the election.""I believe Carter Page was colluding with the Russians,"" Nunberg said on CNN.Page was a junior foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign. He traveled to Moscow twice in 2016 and was the subject of surveillance by the U.S. intelligence community. Page stridently denies doing anything wrong.He and Nunberg never overlapped on the Trump campaign. The campaign fired Nunberg in the summer of 2015, when Trump's candidacy was still in its infancy. Business Insider had written about Nunberg's racially charged Facebook posts from years prior, and the nascent political organization jettisoned him.At the time, Nunberg's firing was viewed as part of a broader struggle between Trump aides Corey Lewandowski and Roger Stone. Nunberg decided to relitigate this on Monday.""Corey wanted to push us out. That's the reality. Now Trump loves Corey. I don't know why he does,"" Nunberg said.By December of that year, Nunberg was saying that Trump's campaign was being led in the wrong direction and predicted that Trump would not win the Republican nomination. By March 2016, Nunberg had endorsed Trump opponent Ted Cruz. The drama continued into the summer of 2016, when Trump sued his former aide for $10 million, alleging Nunberg broke his nondisclosure agreement. After a time, that lawsuit was settled."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/06/ex-trump-aides-bizarre-anti-mueller-media-blitz-begins-with-bang-defiance-ends-with-whimper.html","The former Trump campaign aide who became a television spectacle Monday in a series of bizarre news interviews -- vowing to defy a grand jury subpoena and daring Special Counsel Robert Mueller to “arrest me” -- is now toning down his dramatic rhetoric.""I'm going to end up cooperating with them,"" the aide, Sam Nunberg, told the Associated Press.In an unusual and risky move, Nunberg hit the interview circuit Monday to lash out at the special counsel after receiving a subpoena to appear before a grand jury for the Russia investigation.'LET HIM ARREST ME': TRUMP EX-CAMPAIGN AIDE NUNBERG SAYS HE WILL REFUSE MUELLER'S SUBPOENABut a defiant Nunberg went public with his anger regarding that request, saying: “Let him arrest me.”During one interview on CNN, host Erin Burnett told Nunberg she “smelled alcohol” on his breath. Nunberg denied he had been drinking.He’s long been associated with Stone, the infamous political dirty trickster who has also had a tumultuous relationship as an on-again, off-again adviser to Trump.SAM NUNBERG: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE FORMER TRUMP AIDENunberg said Monday he believes the only reason he's being asked to testify before the grand jury is to provide information that would be used against Stone, which he says he won't do.“I’m not spending 80 hours going over my emails with Roger Stone and Steve Bannon and producing them,” Nunberg said. “Donald Trump won this election on his own. He campaigned his ass off. And there is nobody who hates him more than me.”In other interviews, Nunberg said he thought Mueller may already have incriminating evidence on Trump directly, although he would not say what that evidence might be.He later told CNN that Mueller ""thinks Trump is the Manchurian candidate."" A reference drawn from a Cold War novel and film, a ""Manchurian candidate"" is an American brainwashed or otherwise compromised to work on behalf of an adversarial government.Shortly after Nunberg lobbed the first allegation, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders rebuffed him during her Monday press briefing.""I definitely think he doesn't know that for sure because he's incorrect. As we've said many times before, there was no collusion with the Trump campaign,"" Sanders said. ""He hasn't worked at the White House, so I certainly can't speak to him or the lack of knowledge that he clearly has.""During his afternoon tirades, Nunberg detailed his interview with Mueller's investigators, mocking them for asking such questions as if he had heard Russian being spoken in Trump Tower. ""I think it would be funny if they arrested me,"" Nunberg said on MSNBC.He later added on CNN: ""I'm not going to the grand jury. I'm not going to spend 30 hours going over my emails. I'm not doing it.""Nunberg said he'd already blown a 3 p.m. Monday deadline to turn over the requested communications. He said he'd traded numerous emails a day with Stone and Bannon, and said spending 80 hours digging through his inbox to find them all was unreasonable.A source close to the Trump campaign told Fox News on Monday that Nunberg was fired twice by Trump “for good reason” and was known to be erratic, referring to his media appearances Monday.Nunberg was first fired by Trump in 2014 after an unflattering piece about Trump ran in BuzzFeed as he geared up for a presidential run. Nunberg, a communications aide, helped to arrange the interview and Trump blamed him for the bad press.Nunberg was re-hired for the campaign, but was fired again by Trump in 2015, after past racially-charged Facebook posts surfaced.Later during the campaign, Trump sued Nunberg for $10 million, accusing him of breaching a confidentiality agreement. The lawsuit was later settled.Nunberg was featured in the recent Michael Wolff book “Fire and Fury” and recently sat for a voluntary interview with Mueller.Fox News' Catherine Herridge and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/06/texas-holds-first-2018-primary-amid-surge-democratic-voters.html","The midterm election season officially kicks off on Tuesday, when Texas voters head to the polls for the nation’s first primary of 2018.With early voting already suggesting a record turnout for Democrats, and widespread speculation about what effect an endorsement by President Trump will have on Republican candidates, the Texas primaries are being looked at as both a bellwether for the rest of the nation - and a sign the red state could be turning purple more quickly than expected.“What these primaries really boil down to is one issue: Trump versus anti-Trump,” Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, told Fox News. “There is relatively little talk about the issues for either party. It’s a race to the margins. Democrats are all against the president, while with Republicans it’s about staying close to Trump, and whether that hurts or helps them.”""I want to encourage all of my many Texas friends to vote in the primary for Governor Greg Abbott, Senator Ted Cruz, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, and Attorney General Ken Paxton. They are helping me to Make America Great Again! Vote early or on March 6th,"" Trump tweeted.Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush also got Trump’s endorsement, with the president saying the nephew and grandson of two former presidents “backed me when it wasn't the politically correct thing to do, and I back him now.”It remains to be seen whether a Trump endorsement will hurt or help Bush. But either way, it puts the politician in a strange situation as he tries to merge the backing of the anti-establishment president with that of his storied political family. The Bush dynasty was built on moderate conservative policy positions, and was strongly against Trump in the 2016 race, where George P.’s father, Jeb, ran against him.A recent poll from UT Austin/Texas Tribune found 83 percent of Texas Republicans supportive of Trump.Experts say Republicans will need a big turnout if the party hopes to counter the groundswell of interest for the Democrats.The early numbers also indicate that for the first time since 2008, more Texas Democrats will vote in their primary than Republicans. By Saturday, the Texas Secretary of State’s office noted 465,000 people voted in the Democratic Primary in the state’s 15 largest counties, compared to just about 420,000 Republicans.There are a number of reasons for the uptick in Democratic voter turnout – more female candidates, the emergence of closet Democrats and a dislike of both Trump and the socially conservative Texas Republican Party – and analysts say this should worry Republicans.“This Democratic surge looks really impressive,” Jillson said. “Having Democratic turnout surpass Republicans is a big deal in Texas, and should have the GOP scared.”Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, for example, is likely to face Democratic challenger Beto O’Rourke who, despite being a fundraising powerhouse and an emerging party favorite, is not considered a true contender. A recent Texas Politics Project poll found nearly 40 percent of Texas voters have no idea who O’Rourke even is.“The Democratic surge will show some results, but not enough to flip the state,” Jillson said. “They’re on a slow march, but unless the GOP fumbles this election really badly, Texas will not turn blue.” "

As secretary of state, Clinton chose to use a private, non-secure server for government business.A report from Horowitz’s 14-month investigation into the DOJ and FBI’s handling of the Clinton email case is expected at any time.In December, when the texts between Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page became public, congressional sources said Strzok was part of then FBI Director James Comey's inner circle, who advised and made edits to Comey's July 2016 public statement recommending against criminal charges in the Clinton probe.The edits addressed the likelihood the Clinton server had been compromised. In the initial May 2016 draft, two months before Clinton and more than a dozen key witnesses were interviewed, Comey said it was “reasonably likely” that “hostile actors” gained access to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email account. That was later changed to say the scenario was merely “possible.”In his July 2016 statement, Comey said: “With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked. But, given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved, we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence.”Comey said hostile actors got access to private accounts of Clinton’s close contacts. He also said Clinton’s use of personal email was widely known, her email address was readily apparent and she used the account while travelling overseas where hostile nations and sophisticated hackers operate.“Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail account,” Comey said at the time.Another key edit, which appeared to limit Clinton's legal exposure, included changing the language to describe the former Secretary of State's actions from “grossly negligent” to “extremely careless.”  This is a key legal distinction because, under the federal criminal statute 18 USC 793, the legal standard is gross negligence.“110 e-mails in 52 e-mail chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information at the time they were sent or received,” Comey said in his July 2016 statement about the Clinton case. “Eight of those chains contained information that was top secret at the time they were sent; 36 chains contained secret information at the time; and eight contained confidential information, which is the lowest level of classification.”"

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/06/sam-nunberg-very-sad-story-instant-media-darling.html","Yes, the whole tale is really pretty sad. Weird, sure – totally bizarre, even – but in the end, just sad.Sam Nunberg burst onto America's airwaves Monday, showing up on nearly every network, sometimes more than once. The former aide to not-yet-candidate Donald Trump had made big news: He vowed to ignore a subpoena from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.But Nunberg went much further, telling CNN: ""Trump may have very well done something during the election with the Russians.""Nunberg was everywhere from mid-afternoon into the evening. But by the end, the whole story unraveled. In one interview, Nunberg took credit for being the brains behind Trump's winning campaign, saying: ""I came up with the wall, I came up with the Muslim ban, I came up with everything to attack Jeb Bush, all that stuff."" Trump went out of his way to knock Nunberg. And Nunberg was called a “low-level, part-time consultant"" by the campaign after his firing. “Sam Nunberg was fired. He’s a highly self-destructive individual who makes routine calls begging for his job back,” Trump told The Daily Beast in December 2015 after Nunberg said in an interview that Trump wouldn't win the GOP nomination. “This is the interview of a desperate person who is trying to hang on and stay relevant.”As the day wore on Monday, with Nunberg acting more bizarre – during one phone interview he got another call and actually said ""let me take this for two seconds, OK?"" His friends began to get worried, the Daily Beast reported. They were worried Nunberg ""had been drinking prior to dialing in to MSNBC and CNN.""When Nunberg appeared on CNN's ""Out Front"" with Erin Burnett, he went on a rant about Trump and Mueller. Burnett was put off immediately.“You’ve done six interviews this the past four hours,” Burnett said. “‘Bizarre’ was a word that some White House officials were using to describe some of your interviews. ‘Nuts’ is another one.… I reached out to a Trump ally. This person told me ... ‘you’re drunk or off your meds.’ At least half a dozen other CNN reporters have received similar messages. Is this a hit job or is something wrong?”Later, Burnett pushed harder. ""You're sitting very close to me, we talked earlier about what people in the White House were saying about you.... Talking to you, I have smelled alcohol on your breath,"" Burnett said.""Well, I have not had a drink,"" Nunberg said.""Anything else?"" Burnett asked.""No. No,"" Nunberg said. ""Besides my meds,"" he added, smiling. ""Anti-depressants. Is that OK?""As Burnett pointed out, many Washington insiders knew by then that something was askew with Nunberg. And yet they still quoted him – a ""low-level part-time consultant"" who Trump fired twice, most recently more than a year before the presidential election.MSNBC's Katy Tur asked Nunberg: “Do you think that they have something on the president?"" “I think they may,” Nunberg said. “I think that he may have done something during the election."" And MSNBC ran with the ""story"" all day, over and over again.Mike Allen and Jim VandeHei, two veteran journalists formerly of the Washington Post and Politico and now at Axios, dissected the whole spectacle.""Here's what it was: A sad, epic meltdown – a troubled Trump flunky, pecked at and picked apart like roadkill on the Russia Interstate, in his last gasps of public fame and shame."" And the pair wrote that ""one of Nunberg's friends was furious, telling Axios that the anchors were knowingly taking advantage of an obviously fragile man.""""'What the hell is wrong with you people? ... Shame on you. This isn't news,'"" the friend told them.And so, it was all very sad. The networks – desperate for any dirt on Trump, from anyone! – put someone on their air repeatedly who they knew, or should have known, was, as his friend said, an ""obviously fragile man.""Which prompted Allen and VandeHei to conclude: ""This is one of the reasons America hates the media. Our entire industry lit itself on fire because a troubled Trump hanger-on made an ass of himself – live."""

This is beyond the pale,"" he said.One Mexican citizen had convictions for unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor and a conviction for driving under the influence (DUI), and had been deported in 2003.Another who evaded capture had a conviction for sodomizing a drugged victim in 2012, as well as a DUI from this year -- that Mexican citizen had also been previously deported in 2013.Another illegal immigrant from Mexico, previously deported in 2014 for a conviction for armed robbery, also evaded capture.While the individuals dodged authorities, it is also not clear if there was a definitive link between Schaaf’s statement and their disappearance.An official briefed on the plans at the Department of Homeland Security told The New York Times that ICE agents typically find only about 30 percent of their targets during a sweep, meaning that many of the 800 who evaded capture may not have been caught either way.Schaaf came under intense national pressure, including from the White House, for her actions. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the DOJ was conducting a review. But Schaaf stood by what she did.""I did what I believe was right for my community as well as to protect public safety,"" Schaaf said Friday, according to NBC Bay Area. ""People should be able to live without fear or panic and know their rights and responsibilities as well as their recourses.""Among those caught in the raid were immigrants with a lengthy list of convictions, including aggravated assault, murder, hit-run, lewd acts with a minor, burglary, cruelty toward a child, indecent exposure, domestic violence, drug trafficking, battery, sex offenses and false imprisonment.In a press release, ICE pointed to the case of Armando Nunez-Salgado, a Mexican gang member who had been deported four times and had convictions including assault with a deadly weapon, burglary, hit-and-run causing injury and evasion of a police officer.Another deportee was a Mexican gang member with convictions for, among other things, possession of a dangerous weapon, spousal abuse, burglary and battery on a police officer.“Recent legislation has negatively impacted ICE operations in California by nearly eliminating all cooperation and communication with our law enforcement partners in the state by prohibiting local law enforcement from contracting with the federal government to house detainees,” the statement said.“Ultimately, efforts by local politicians have shielded removable criminal aliens from immigration enforcement and created another magnet for more illegal immigration, all at the expense of the safety and security of the very people it purports to protect,” it said.  "

In fact, Kellyanne’s statements actually show her intention and desire to comply with the Hatch Act – as she twice declined to respond to the host’s specific invitation to encourage Alabamans to vote for the Republican.”Appearing on Fox News on Nov. 20, Conway touted President Trump’s tax plan before taking aim at Jones.“Doug Jones in Alabama, folks, don’t be fooled,” Conway said at the time. “He’ll be a vote against tax cuts. He’s weak on crime, weak on borders. He’s strong on raising your taxes. He’s terrible for property owners. And Doug Jones is a doctrinaire liberal which is why he’s not saying anything and the media are trying to boost him.”“Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade asked Conway, “So vote Roy Moore?”Conway replied, “I’m telling you that we want the votes in the Senate to get this tax bill through.”The report also faults Conway for a Dec. 6 appearance on CNN’s New Day, when also she discussed the race.The Office of Special Counsel said it submitted the report to President Trump so he could take “appropriate disciplinary action.”The agency says Conway did not respond to requests from the Office of Special Counsel to respond to the allegations.“Ms. Conway’s statements during the Fox & Friends and New Day interviews impermissibly mixed official government business with political views about candidates in the Alabama special election for U.S. Senate,” the report states.Fox News’  John Roberts, Joseph Weber and Barnini Chakraborty contributed to this report."

Rob Forrest, the former head of her security detail. Forrest, who was also married, resigned in January.The revelation of the affair derailed the first term of a mayor who was seen a rising star among Democrats.Metro Nashville Police records show Forrest's overtime more than doubled in the budget year after Barry was elected in September 2015. Barry said the affair began in spring 2016, according to an affidavit.Barry agreed to resign as part of a plea deal.""It has been the privilege of my entire professional life to have the blessing and opportunity to be your mayor,"" she said. ""God bless this wonderful city. I love you, Nashville."" In a statement, Barry said if photographs were taken of her, it was done without her knowledge or consent.“The allegations of photos taken of myself are very troubling and infuriating if true,"" Barry said in a statement, calling the act a ""complete invasion of my privacy.""The photos appear to be taken with Forrest’s phone while he was in Washington, D.C., with Barry on two occasions, according to The Tennessean.Aside from photos, investigators uncovered 260 deleted messages between him and Barry as well as nearly three dozen deleted phone calls.“I accept full responsibility for the pain I have caused my family and his. I am so sorry to my husband Bruce, who has stood by me in my darkest moments and remains committed to our marriage, just as I am committed to repairing the damage I have done,” Barry said in a statement.“While I regret any distractions that will be caused by my actions, I remain firmly committed to working hard to serve the people of Nashville now and into the future,” she continued. “God will forgive me, but the people of Nashville don’t have to. In the weeks and months to come, I will work hard to earn your forgiveness and earn back your trust.”Both Forrest and Barry are married. Forrest accompanied Barry to many of her public events, including on trips abroad, according to The Tennessean.Forrest resigned from the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department effective Jan. 31, WZTV reported. He will receive $80,000 per year in pension, according to the station.“We cannot begin to describe the pain and heartbreak that comes with losing our only child. Our son was a kind soul full of life and love for his family and friends,” Max's parents said.Barry spoke publicly about her son's overdose during a press conference on Aug. 7, 2017, encouraging parents to have tough conversations with their kids about drugs and to discuss her plans to combat the nation's opioid crisis.""This is not an unfamiliar nationwide or community conversation,"" Barry said.

He praised the ""possible progress"" but remained cautious.The Hermit Kingdom added that it’s willing to give up its nuclear weapons if military threats against North Korea subsides, Chung said hours after leaving Pyongyang.WHAT KIM JONG UN’S SISTER REALLY MEANS WHEN CALLING FOR NORTH AND SOUTH ‘UNIFICATION’North and South Korea agreed to hold summit talks in April at the border. The leaders will establish a “hotline” communication channel to lower military tensions, Chung added.“North Korea threatens the entire global community through its unlawful nuclear and ballistic missile programs and proliferation activities, including its arms exports to Africa. It doesn’t just involve our allies in Europe or Asia. It doesn’t just include countries with longstanding ties to [North Korea] like China and Russia. This is and must be a global effort,"" Tillerson said in a speech at George Mason University. The comments mark a major change in tone after months of bombastic threats by the rogue regime to keep developing its nuclear and missile program. Last month’s Pyeongchang Olympics sparked the first talks between the two Koreas that followed a flurry of cooperative steps taken to ease tensions during the Winter Games.North Korea sent a delegation of athletes, cheerleaders, art troupe members and officials to Pyeongchang for the Olympics. Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, labeled by the South’s media as “Kim Jong Un’s Ivanka,” attended the opening ceremony and met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in over a three-day visit. At one point, she even wrote of her “wishes” for closer ties in a guest book at South Korea’s presidential office.""I expect Pyongyang and Seoul to get closer in the hearts of our [Korean] people and the future of unification and prosperity will be advanced,"" Kim wrote in Korean in the guest book, according to Yonhap News Agency.KIM JONG UN'S HARD CURRENCY EXPECTED TO RUN DRY BY OCTOBER, SOUTH KOREAN LAWMAKER SAYSBut the “future of unification” phrase means something far more sinister for the Kim family and his regime. North Korea has touted unification as a “final victory” to the Korean War that ended in an armistice in 1953. In Pyongyang’s view, ""unification"" means Kim’s brutal dictatorship would overcome the South’s government.There have been two summits, one in 2000 and another in 2007, held between Kim's late father, Kim Jong Il, and two liberal South Korean presidents. They resulted in a series of cooperative projects between the Koreas that were scuttled during subsequent conservative administrations in South Korea.Kim’s apparent olive branch to South Korea and the U.S. comes after months of mounting sanctions against the volatile regime. Kang Seok-ho, of the Liberty Korea Party, previously said the despot is scrambling to keep his regime afloat best the international sanctions was crippling his economy.""I received an analysis that, if international sanctions against the North continue like this, all of North Korea's foreign currency earnings and overseas assets will be frozen, and its dollar [reserves] will dry up around October,"" Kang said. ""At a time like this, our government should further strengthen cooperation with the international community on sanctions against the North.""Tillerson also said in mid-January there was “a lot of evidence that these sanctions are starting to hurt” North Korea.The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/06/trump-wants-to-cut-trade-deficit-if-does-ll-create-lot-us-jobs.html","Of all the economic policies President Trump has marked for attention this year – merit-based immigration, infrastructure and vocational training – fixing the trade deficit offers the biggest bang for the buck. Cutting the $620 billion annual trade gap in half could create 2 million jobs.Manufacturing would benefit most, and it finances two-thirds of business research and development. Investments in intellectual property for new materials, supply chain management, artificial intelligence and the like could boost long-term economic growth by a full percentage point.China accounts for 60 percent of the U.S. trade deficit and habitually subsidizes domestic industries, limits imports in areas of rapidly advancing technology to incubate its own competitors, and forces foreign multinationals to transfer technology as a condition for market access. It compels their compliance with the Communist Party political agenda and insidious activities monitoring its citizens.Whatever the U.S. does regarding China affects our allies, and the proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum have attracted strong rebuke and threats of retaliation on our exports from our friends. Lost in all the media coverage is the fact that the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements provide for a national security exception when the survival of critical domestic industries is threatened.Still, rifle-shot remedies, absent a comprehensive strategy, do pose the danger of casting the Americans, not the Chinese, as malefactors in the eyes of world leaders. President Trump needs their cooperation to accomplish a radical change in commercial relations with China.President Trump has linked an exception to the tariffs on steel and aluminum for Canada and Mexico to bringing the negotiations to modernize NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement) to a quicker conclusion. However, some U.S. expectations for these talks are particularly maddening – for example, that Mexico and Canada agree to eliminate arbitration panels to resolve investor disputes.Those provisions protect U.S. companies from arbitrary foreign government actions – such as requirements to source components locally instead of from U.S. factories, coerced technology transfers and arbitrary treatment by foreign courts – and likely reduce, not increase, the U.S. trade deficit.Coming up with a fresh approach to China, in concert with the European Union and other allies requires a wholesale rethinking of our WTO relationship with the Middle Kingdom.The global trade body was conceived to be a club of market economies. Its dispute settlement mechanism is designed to rein in national industrial policies that occasionally harm other members – namely, discipline the venial sins of market economy governments.China is not a market economy. It was admitted into the WTO on the premise that greater engagement with the West would accelerate market-oriented reforms, but Beijing’s success at flaunting the rules has taken it in the opposite direction.China’s violations of WTO rules are far more sweeping than anything the dispute settlement mechanism was designed to handle. It’s time to recognize that China will never be a market economy compatible with fair competition, and Western nations would do well to impose a regime that balances its trade with the West.The Trump administration is reported to be fashioning a broad response to China. It would do well to deal with both the investment and trade holistically.America should impose across-the-board restrictions on Chinese investments in the United States that mirror Beijing’s policies toward U.S. investments in China.On trade, the United States should impose a system of licenses on imports from China and encourage its allies to do the same. Exporters would be granted transferable rights to imports equal to their sales in China.This would balance trade with China, and a system of re-sellable licenses would let the market decide which Chinese imports are most highly valued by consumers and aid U.S. exporters. And it would obviate the need of global tariffs that swipe at U.S. trading partners as well as China.If China wants to talk trade after that we can engage Beijing in long negotiations while its businesses acclimate to being treated as their government treats U.S. businesses."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/06/what-is-daca-and-what-does-trump-administration-want-to-do-with-it.html","President Trump and lawmakers are still struggling to come up with a plan for the hundreds of thousands of young, undocumented immigrants living in the United States.In September, the Trump administration announced its plan to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) – which provides a level of amnesty to certain undocumented immigrants, many of whom came to the U.S. as children – with a six-month delay for recipients. Trump set a deadline of March 5 as the end date for the DACA program, but a lower court ordered the administration to continue to accept renewal applications indefinitely. The U.S. Supreme Court declined in late February to take up the administration's request for an appeal of the order that requires the continuing acceptance of renewal applications.Individuals were able to request DACA status if they were under the age of 31 on June 15, 2012, came to the U.S. before turning 16 and continuously lived in the country since June 15, 2007.Individuals also had to have a high school diploma, GED certification, been honorably discharged from the military or still be in school. Recipients could not have a criminal record.It did not provide “legal status.”Thousands of people could lose their jobs if the DACA program is rescinded permanently, according to a study by left-leaning think tank Center for American Progress.Daniel Garza, president of the conservative immigration nonprofit Libre Initiative, told Fox News that DACA offers a “reprieve from a life of uncertainty for innocent kids who didn’t break the law.”“It’s rather disappointing to think they could return to a state of anxiety and fear,” he said.While the courts’ decisions have relieved much of the urgency surrounding the March 5 deadline, there are nearly 22,000 people whose initial applications have yet to be decided and are at risk until their petitions are granted.Since the announcement, Trump has offered to work with lawmakers on a solution for the hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. who fell under DACA’s umbrella of protections. But he has also repeatedly blamed Democrats on social media for lack of a solution. Earlier this year, Trump released his “four pillars” of immigration reform, which included a provision for legal status for DACA recipients and others who would be eligible for DACA status. The White House estimated that total to be 1.8 million people. The Senate rejected the plan.Republicans – and some Democrats – opposed Obama’s directive establishing DACA from the start as a perceived overreach of executive power.Obama spoke out on social media after the Trump administration announced a plan to dismantle the program, stating that it's ""self-defeating ... and it is cruel"" to end DACA and questioned the motive behind the decision. In fiscal year 2016, 359 DACA recipients had enlisted in the Army – which is the only branch to accept immigrants of this category.A Department of Defense official said in April that the military would continue to accept noncitizen recruits, but it is unclear if that will continue to be the case.The Associated Press contributed to this report.  "

It didn't take long for players across the country to follow his lead.President Trump made his position clear from the beginning.A football field is not the place to stage a protest, Trump has argued on several occasions, especially one that involves ""disrespecting"" the American flag and the nation's veterans.There is no official directive, but the agents said it's understood that the team isn’t going to pursue anyone who participated in the protests, the paper reported.The team slammed the ""categorically false"" report days later, saying it was ""without merit.""""A recent report that suggests the Houston Texans would not sign a player who has protested in support of social justice issues is categorically false and without merit. The Texans ownership, coaching, personnel and executive staff sign and hire employees based on talent, character and fit within our organization,"" the Texans responded in a statement. Once again, Trump called out NFL players for kneeling, retweeting a meme that depicted a widow laying on a soldier's grave. ""Show this picture to the NFL players who still kneel,"" Trump posted on Jan. 4.Trump also took a subtle swipe at the NFL during his first State of the Union address on Jan. 31.He didn't mention the NFL by name, but he did thank one of his special guests, 12-year-old Preston Sharp, for reminding Americans why it's important to stand for the national anthem.The boy from Redding, California, started the Flag and Flower Challenge in 2015 and has helped facilitate the placement of more than 40,000 American flags and flowers on veterans' graves.“Preston's reverence for those who have served our nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem,” Trump said.Former NFL running back Herschel Walker weighed in on the protests on Feb. 2, two days before Super Bowl LII. ""The league gave the players a large sum of money toward their cause. That's hush money,"" he told Fox and Friends. ""Guys should have been standing at the very beginning.""Walker said the league needs ""good leadership"" to put an end to the national anthem protests once and for all, adding that he doesn't believe Kaepernick would have protested if he was starting quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers, rather than the backup, during the 2016 season.""There's no doubt black lives matter, but I don't think you can protest on your job,"" Walker said. ""Your First Amendment right should be, 'I want to stand for our military.'""He sat during the Star-Spangled Banner -- but when the Mexican national anthem played, he was back on his feet.Trump shared his disapproval on Twitter, requesting that Lynch be suspended for the move.“Marshawn Lynch of the NFL’s Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect!” Trump tweeted. “Next time NFL should suspend him for the remainder of the season. Attendance and ratings way down.”Ten days later, the NFL announced a commitment to donate $90 million to social justice causes during the following seven years in response to national anthem demonstrations.”The NFL’s work will encompass programs and initiatives that reduce barriers to opportunity, with a priority on supporting improvements in education, community/police relations and our criminal justice system,"" Anna Isaacson, the league’s vice president for social responsibility, wrote in a memo obtained by The Associated Press. ""Additional focus areas include poverty, racial equality and workforce development.”""I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,"" Pence tweeted shortly after exiting the stadium.On Oct. 10, 2017, Goodell sent a letter to the NFL's owners about the possibility of a rule change that would force players to stand during the national anthem.""The current dispute over the National Anthem is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country,” Goodell wrote, noting that he respects players' right to free speech. “We want to honor our flag and our country, and our fans expect that of us.""""We can't have the inmates running the prison,"" Houston Texans owner Bob McNair said during a closed meeting of NFL owners and executives to discuss national anthem protests.McNair later apologized after receiving backlash for the remark.""I regret that I used that expression,"" he said in a statement. ""I never meant to offend anyone and I was not referring to our players.""""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say 'get that son of a b**** off the field right now - he's fired,'"" Trump said at a rally for then-Senator Luther Strange in Alabama. ""You know, some owner's going to do that.""Goodell released a statement the next day, saying Trump's comments demonstrated a ""lack of respect"" for the league.Two days after Trump's remarks, three NFL teams — the Tennessee Titans, Seattle Seahawks and Pittsburgh Steelers — stayed in their locker rooms during the national anthem.Villanueva later regretted the move and apologized for ""unintentionally"" throwing his teammates under the bus.“I made my teammates look bad, and that’s my fault, and my fault only,” Villanueva told reporters during a news conference. “We as a team tried to figure it out, but obviously butchered it.”Trump said he felt compelled to speak out against the NFL protests on Sept. 26, 2017, after visiting injured soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.""They were fighting for our flag, they were fighting for our national anthem,” Trump said during a press conference at the White House. “For people to disrespect that by kneeling during the playing of our national anthem I think is disgraceful.”NFL players were quick to respond.More than a dozen players with the Cleveland Browns kneeled and bowed their heads in silent prayer when the anthem was played ahead of a preseason game against the New York Giants on Sept. 29, 2017.The protest was the largest the NFL had seen since Kaepernick kicked off the trend the previous season.It was a photo shared across the web: Marshawn Lynch — at his first game on Aug. 12, 2017, as an Oakland Raider — sitting on an orange cooler with his elbows resting on his knees as his teammates stood around him during the national anthem.A day later, Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett sat on the bench as his teammates linked arms during the national anthem before their game against the Los Angeles Chargers.""I just like what he’s doing, and I’m standing behind him,"" Lane told ESPN. ""It’s something I plan on keep on doing, until I feel like justice is being served.""The next day, San Francisco 49ers safety Eric Reid dropped to one knee to protest racial injustice and police brutality alongside Kaepernick during the national anthem at the Chargers' Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego.The teammates were met with boos from the crowd as a naval officer sang the ""Star-Spangled Banner"" while dozens of military members rolled out an American flag across the field.On Sept. 8, 2016, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters he disagreed with Kaepernick's decision to kneel during the national anthem, but said he had to respect the player's right to protest.""I don't necessarily agree with what he is doing,"" Goodell told The Associated Press via email. ""I support our players when they want to see change in society, and we don't live in a perfect society. On the other hand, we believe very strongly in patriotism in the NFL. I personally believe very strongly in that.""The protests only continued to grow in the following days.Kansas City cornerback Marcus Peters raised a black-gloved fist, four Miami Dolphins — Arian Foster, Michael Thomas, Jenkins and Kenny Stills — kneeled with hands on their hearts, Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall took a knee and New England's Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty both held up their right arms during the national anthem on Sept. 11, 2016.Several other teams, including the Chiefs and Seahawks, also saw players link arms when the anthem was played.Two weeks later, on Aug. 26, 2016, Kaepernick made headlines for sitting during the national anthem before his preseason debut against the Green Bay Packers at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.NFLFemale.com's Jennifer Lee Chan was one of the first reporters to capture a photo of Kaepernick sitting during the national anthem. Mike Garafolo, a reporter for the NFL Network, was quick to point out it wasn't the NFL player's first protest.For the first time, on Aug. 27, 2016, Kaepernick, who was competing with Blaine Gabbert for the 49ers’ starting quarterback position at the time, explained why he refused to stand during the anthem.Kaepernick made it clear that he knew what he was doing and the NFL star said he planned to continue protesting – even if that meant jeopardizing his football career.""This is not something that I am going to run by anybody,"" he said. ""I am not looking for approval. I have to stand up for people that are oppressed...If they take football away, my endorsements from me, I know that I stood up for what is right."""
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/06/gun-control-measures-proposed-by-trump-lawmakers-after-florida-school-shooting.html","Two weeks after a gunman walked into a high school in Parkland, Florida, and killed 17 students and faculty members, survivors aren't giving up their fight for stronger gun control efforts.Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School teenagers have moved front and center in the gun control debate, organizing a coming national school walkout, meeting with President Donald Trump, lobbying state lawmakers and participating in protests.Since the Feb. 14 shooting, several ideas have been floated by the White House, Republicans, Democrats and state officials to combat gun violence. Trump also hosted a group of bipartisan lawmakers at the White House to discuss reform.On Twitter, Trump promoted the idea of having “highly trained, gun adept” teachers and coaches in schools who could confront a shooter before first responders arrived or serve as a “deterrent to the cowards that do this.”“If a potential ‘sicko shooter’ knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work!” Trump tweeted.Two school districts near Dayton, Ohio, already train a group of select teachers and faculty members to confront an active shooter. These staff members, whose identities are not revealed, have access to safes throughout the schools which have guns hidden inside.Ohio offers funding for schools to train staff to respond in emergency situations. There are more than a dozen other states across the country with school districts that have teachers or staff members who are trained to fire back, or which legally allow adults with guns on school grounds.Gun control advocates point to what they see as “loopholes” in the current system that could allow for people to purchase guns even when they legally should not be able to do so.Specifically, Jonas Oransky, deputy legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit that advocates for stronger gun control, noted the ability for consumers to purchase guns from a private seller without completing a background check.He also pointed to the so-called “Charleston loophole,” which allows dealers to sell guns to a customer before a background check is completed – when National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) marks a document “delayed” but does not approve or deny it within three business days. He said a disproportionate number of buyers who obtain a gun before a background check is completed are domestic abusers, citing complex records and restraining orders that investigators need additional time to read through or discuss with the appropriate local law enforcement agency.However, Second Amendment advocates argue the background check system already does too much.“We don’t think it’s proper for people to have to prove their innocence to the government in order to exercise their God-given right,” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, a Virginia-based gun rights nonprofit, told Fox News.Attorney General Jeff Sessions said top officials in the Justice Department believe they can ban bump stocks through the regulatory process. However, gun manufacturers and owners are likely to sue if they are banned without any legislation from Congress.Bump stocks were approved in 2010 by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives after concluding the devices did not turn guns into machine guns, which are prohibited under the National Firearms Act.The devices weren’t used in the Parkland shooting, but the massacre did reignite the debate over whether they should be banned.""I have traditionally not supported looking at magazine clip size and after this and some of the details I have learned about it, I am reconsidering that position,"" Rubio said during a recent town hall. ""While it may not prevent an attack, it may save lives in an attack ... So we'll have to get into that debate, but that is something I believe that we can reach a compromise [on] in this country, and that I'm willing to reconsider.""The suspected gunman had to stop to reload his firearm during the massacre, which Rubio added was “evidence in this case that it saved the lives of some people.” Several measures introduced in states across the country – including in Colorado, Illinois and Rhode Island – would ban high-capacity magazines.“There’s nothing more important than protecting our children,” Trump said. National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch has already said the powerful gun lobby does not support raising the age limit to purchase certain firearms. After Trump’s White House meeting, she told Fox News it was “good TV,” but some of the proposals were “really bad policy.”However, some Republican senators, including Rubio and Pat Roberts of Kansas, have voiced support for raising the minimum age to purchase certain types of firearms.“Certainly, nobody under 21 should have an AR-15,"" Roberts said.Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, announced this week that it would stop selling firearms and ammunition to anyone under the age of 21.According to a Harvard CAPS-Harris survey, 61 percent of respondents support banning the AR-15 firearm, used in many of the recent mass shootings in the U.S., including Parkland. Just 39 percent of respondents said adults who pass a background check should be allowed to purchase the firearm.Dick’s Sporting Goods announced in February that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and prohibit anyone under the age of 21 from purchasing a firearm.“We support and respect the Second Amendment, and we recognize and appreciate that the vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens,” Edward W. Stack, chairman and CEO of Dick’s Sporting Goods, said in a statement. “But we have to help solve the problem that’s in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic that’s taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America – our kids.”Stack also said the company would stop selling high-capacity magazines and will continue its policy of not selling bump stocks.“Some will say these steps can’t guarantee tragedies like Parkland will never happen again. They may be correct – but if common sense reform is enacted and even one life is saved, it will have been worth it,” Stack said.“I’m a fan of the NRA,” Trump said. “There’s no bigger fan. I'm a big fan of the NRA. These are great people, these great patriots. They love our country. But that doesn't mean we have to agree on everything.”Several companies have cut ties with the NRA since the Parkland school shooting. Among them are: Avis Budget Group, Enterprise Holdings, MetLife, United and Delta.Georgia lawmakers voted to yank a tax break for Atlanta-based Delta on March 1 after the airline severed ties with the NRA.The bill cleared the state House with an overwhelming 135-24 vote, after being approved in the state Senate on a 44-10 vote. It was then sent to the governor's desk.The final version dropped an earlier amendment that would have renewed a jet fuel tax exemption worth $50 million that was taken off the books in 2015.“Businesses have every legal right to make their own decisions, but the Republican majority in our state legislature also has every right to govern guided by our principles,” said Lieutenant Gov. Casey Cagle, who threatened to kill the airline tax break days prior to the vote.The threat prompted liberal governors nationwide to court the airline, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo who tweeted his support and encouraged Delta to move its headquarters north.“Now more than ever the NRA is showing just how out of step they are with the American people,” Cuomo said in a statement, calling the NRA's agenda “dangerous.”The NRA has fired back at companies like Delta – and at the lawmakers encouraging them – for allegedly not supporting the Second Amendment.“Ultimately, our members are passionate #2A supporters. Having those on the left pushing for a boycott to pressure companies to drop discounts just shows how out of touch some are,” the NRA said on Twitter.Fox News’ Jennifer Earl, Matt Finn, Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

However, that order does not apply to first-time applicants.That process has so far yielded a number of proposals, all of which have failed to gain enough support in the Senate to pick up the 60 votes needed. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused Trump last month of trying to spike a deal when he rejected one of the bipartisan proposals as a ""total catastrophe.""“Why? Because it isn’t 100 percent of what the president wants on immigration? That’s not how our democracy works – you don’t get 100 percent of what you want in a democracy,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. “Maybe in a dictatorship.”TRUMP'S DACA DEADLINE PASSES UNDER LEGAL CLOUD, WITH URGENCY DWINDLING IN CONGRESSAmong those rejected included a proposal from the White House that would include a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants as part of an immigration package that included $25 billion for a wall and other border enforcement measures and sharp cuts to legal immigration.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La. said last week that members are moving forward with a plan that would address DACA and the president’s other priorities of building a southern border wall, ending so-called “chain migration” and changing a federal immigration program from a lottery to a merit-based system.“We are continuing to fix the DACA problem that was left on our doorstep when Barack Obama created a program that had no resolution,” Scalise said. “Now is the time to solve that problem. And we’re working to get that consensus.”Another shutdown looms on March 23, the deadline for Congress to pass another spending bill to keep the government running, where a DACA fix could form part of that negotiation as well.Fox News’ Joseph Weber and the Associated Press contributed to this report."

President Trump's family cares about the public lands and he cares about Utah and what we're thinking,"" he said.Under the plan, National Parks Highway that overlaps multiple roads connecting well-known parks would be renamed after Trump.

""I don't think people are going to be willing to drive on a road with his name on it,"" said Wendy Garvin, with the Utah Progressive Caucus.""No one values the splendor of Utah more than you do,"" Trump told the crowd during the announcement last year. ”And no one knows better how to use it.""The president said the sprawling national monuments were a “massive federal land grab” by the government under Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. Both monuments were protected under the Antiquities Act.“These abuses of the Antiquities Act give enormous power to faraway bureaucrats at the expense of the people who actually live here, work here and make this place their home,"" Trump added.Native American tribes and environmentalists condemned Trump’s decision, claiming the monuments protected rich natural and archaeological resources.Republicans in the state, meanwhile, welcomed the move to shrink the monuments because it limited what can be done with the millions of acres they encompass.The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/06/cal-thomas-trump-boldly-wades-into-cutting-federal-government-down-to-size-will-it-work.html","Of all the promises candidate Donald Trump made during the 2016 presidential campaign, none will be more difficult to fulfill than cutting the size and cost of the federal government. That’s because Congress, which must decide whether to keep a federal agency, has the final word in such matters and spending – especially spending in one’s home state or district – is what keeps so many of them in office. Who doubts that self-preservation is the primary objective of most members of Congress?Ronald Reagan made similar promises about reducing the size of the bloated federal government, but was unable to fulfill them because of congressional intransigence. Perhaps his most notable failure was attempting to eliminate the Department of Education, an unnecessary Cabinet-level agency created by Jimmy Carter, reportedly as the fulfillment of a campaign promise to the National Education Association (NEA), the largest labor union in the United States, which backed him in the 1976 and 1980 elections. This pithy statement by Reagan got to the heart of the issue: “No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. Government programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we’ll ever see on this earth!”President Trump has asked every federal agency to submit a reorganization plan to the White House. Some programs, like the U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) Biological Survey Unit (BSU), are decades old. The BSU was established in 1885, and among its tasks is the preservation of the whooping crane. Last I checked those birds seemed to be doing OK, but why is this, along with so many other things, a responsibility of the federal government?What’s needed is a strategy that shames Congress, which sometimes seems beyond shame, for misspending the people’s money. What will help in that shaming is for the president to establish an independent commission made up of retired Republicans, Democrats and average citizens. This commission would conduct a top-to-bottom audit of the federal government and present its findings to Congress, while simultaneously releasing them to the public, which would then apply pressure on Congress to adopt them.“Without authorization,” notes Schatz, “the feds spent $19.6 million annually on the International Fund for Ireland. Sounds like a noble cause, but the money went for projects like pony-trekking centers and golf videos.“Congressional budget-cutters spared the $440,000 spent annually to have attendants push buttons on the fully automated Capitol Hill elevators used by representatives and senators.“Last year, the National Endowment for the Humanities spent $4.2 million to conduct a nebulous ‘National Conversation on Pluralism and Identity.’ Obviously, talk radio wasn’t considered good enough.“The Pentagon and Central Intelligence Agency channeled some $11 million to psychics who might provide special insights about various foreign threats. This was the disappointing ‘Stargate’ program.”The list goes on and on. Go to cagw.org, read all about it and remember it’s our money paying for these boondoggles (definition: “a project funded by the federal government out of political favoritism that is of no real value to the community or the nation”) that helps keep our free-spending career politicians in office where they get benefits the rest of us can only dream about.Yes, entitlements are the main drivers of debt and they, too, need reform. But starting with programs most people would find outrageous and worthy of elimination is a good way to build confidence and make the tackling of entitlements more palatable."

In one instance, a whistleblower called out a dinning set order worth $31,000. It easily exceeded a $5,000 limit on such purchases.Carson cancelled the order. The agency announced it is working to rescind the order.Another issue involves Ben Carson Jr., the secretary’s son and a businessman, who was invited by the secretary to attend a Baltimore “listening tour” last summer, despite ethical concerns from the department lawyers.“I don’t have any problem with ethics,” Carson told the Times. “Here is a rather unique situation, [Ben Carson Jr.] is somebody who is integrally important to me, and wants to help. I’m not going to just say no because it looks this way or that way.”The secretary claims the criticisms are only a distraction from his grand vision of the agency as a way to help the working poor in the country, something he believes the agency has not been doing for a long time."

Indeed, photos of other presidential phone calls depict Obama leaning on his desk, with his feet on the floor.”The relationship was further strained during the Obama administration’s decision to move forward with the Iran nuclear deal. Netanyahu and Obama also were at odds towards the end of the Obama administration—when the U.S. allowed for the passage of a resolution condemning Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank.On Monday, Trump noted his intent to attend the opening of the embassy at the newly-recognized capital in mid-May. “Israel is very special to me—special country, special people, and I look forward to being there.”“What better to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians,” Trump said, noting the embassy move gives “a real opportunity for peace.” “We’ll see how it works out. The Palestinians are wanting to come back to the table. Very badly.”Trump added: “If they don’t, you don’t have peace. And that’s a possibility also.”Netanyahu praised Trump's “leadership and friendship,” noting that “under your leadership, [U.S.-Israeli relations] have never been stronger.”Neither addressed the swirling corruption scandal engulfing Netanyahu's administration, or the ongoing Russia probe that has hindered Trump's time in the White House."

But unexpectedly, upstart far-right leader Matteo Salvini and his party got more votes than Berlusconi’s did. Berlusconi, though prevented by a tax-fraud conviction from holding political office, had been expected to be the kingmaker of a center-right coalition that in some polls was favored to run the country next.As Alberto Castelvecchi of LUISS University in Rome put it: “Berlusconi’s comeback was very strong in the media, in the TV, in the magazines, in the newspapers, but not so strong to beat the younger and much more vocal Matteo Salvini.”Salvini campaigned on “Italy First,” is eurosceptic and unabashedly anti-migration. The other day he said: “We are under attack—our culture, society, traditions and way of life are at risk.”“I think if they create a coalition among the populists, it would be fantastic,” he told a local newspaper, “It would terrify Brussels, pierce it in its heart.”But such a “dream team” probably won’t become a reality. Salvini said his “League” party won’t join forces with the other populist powerhouse, Five Star. But still, he believes Brussels is on edge.The incumbent Democrats took just 18 percent of votes.  They didn’t rate on the big issues of migration and economy even though Italy has returned to growth under their stewardship, and they have cracked down on illegal migration.And in terms of Russian interference—the jury is out on that loaded topic. But one common line of argument in Italy is that the Russians wouldn’t have needed to do a thing. Five Star was on its own web-based fast track trajectory. And Salvini is friends with President Vladimir Putin, never hiding his support for the Russian strongman.Berlusconi and Putin have always gotten along. Finally, Italy is not giving Russia much trouble. It is one of the most pro-Russian countries in Europe when it comes to desire to do business with Moscow.Now, the horse-trading begins. Someone is going to have to form a government. And they are going to need to convince Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella that they have what it takes to cobble together a grouping that can easily win majorities in Parliament."

And the result is that she got roughed up a bit as she decided to walk out the door.The New York Times said Hicks had testified that she sometimes told white lies for her boss. That, needless to say, is not a good look for a White House communications director.But Republican congressman Peter King told the Washington Post that Hicks, who said she never lied in the Russia investigation, was avoiding a Democratic “perjury trap” and “never lied about anything of substance—so that white lies could have meant saying Trump wasn’t available for a meeting when he actually was.Nor did she attempt to rebut an account that Trump had berated her about her testimony. Hicks was a buffer who knew how to absorb the inevitable presidential tirades, and colleagues would sometimes ask her to bring him bad news.Inevitably, she was involved in certain messes. Some questioned her initial role in defending Rob Porter, the staff secretary fired over abuse allegations from two ex-wives, because she had been dating him. And some questioned her role in explaining Donald Trump Jr.’s campaign meeting with the Russians—one of many subjects that must have come up in her interviews with Robert Mueller.Hicks didn’t seek to run the 40-person communications shop. She took the job on an acting basis after Anthony Scaramucci’s flameout and it later became permanent, giving a defined set of responsibilities to someone who had always had a wide-ranging portfolio.It’s true that the president may miss her presence, especially now that most of his original team—Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Sean Spicer, Dina Powell and many others—have left. But Trump still talks regularly to people like Reince and Corey, so Hicks could remain an important sounding board.I first met Hope Hicks, who had worked for Ivanka’s business, in the first week of the Trump candidacy, when she and Corey Lewandowski were pretty much the campaign. Many reporters got to know her even as she stayed firmly behind the scenes.Hicks had a major influence with few fingerprints. Last year, when the president began pausing virtually every day to talk to reporters, either at photo ops or getting on or off Air Force One, Hicks was a major proponent of that strategy. In the last two weeks of the general election, when just about everyone thought Trump would lose, a friend asked me if I would write about Hicks’ key role so there would at least be a public record of what she had done for the candidate.There was just one problem. Hope said no way."

Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse. Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc. Isn't the I.G. an Obama guy? Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!""That last word is just remarkable.How credible would it be if Sessions, a big Senate supporter and surrogate of the Trump campaign, who's recused himself from the Russia probe, was overseeing an investigation of how the Obama DOJ handled a surveillance request against a Trump adviser who had contacts with Russia?That's why you have an independent inspector general. And that job is generally occupied by career prosecutors, like Michael Horowitz, who has worked in both Republican and Democratic administrations.Sessions was firm but restrained in a statement, saying, ""As long as I am attorney general, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and the Constitution.""Trump has privately bashed and tweet-trashed Sessions before, most notably when he was angry that Sessions had recused himself from the investigation now run by Robert Mueller. Things reached the point that Sessions handed in his resignation letter, which the president refused to accept.Just last week came this presidential tweet: ""Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren't they the subject of the investigation?"" Trump tweeted. ""Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!""Fox's Brit Hume said of the latest tweet that ""this is Trump at his worst. He is asking that the DOJ investigate itself. The inspector general, who has his own staff of lawyers and investigators, at least enjoys a measure of independence from the department. Trump still wants the AG to act his political goalie.""On the other side, Jerry Falwell Jr. tweeted that Sessions ""must be part of the Bush/Romney/McCain Republican Establishment. He probably supported @realDonaldTrump early in campaign to hide who he really is. Or he could just be a coward.""Is Trump trying to embarrass Sessions into quitting? He's not a big fan of Rod Rosenstein, who would become acting AG, and the No. 3, Rachel Brand, recently quit.

But the way they performed was really a disgrace.""That was the lead of the New York Times story. The Washington Post ran a piece saying ""here's what he’s done in the face of danger"": accepting five Vietnam draft deferments (one of them for bone spurs) and appearing spooked when a man charged the stage at a campaign rally.Others ran pieces on Trump critic Stephen Colbert mocking the president. USA Today’s headline: ""Late night: Trump's living in a 'fantasy world' for saying he’d have 'run in' to Fla. school.""The Chicago Tribune’s headline: ""Colbert to Trump: 'What are you going to do, run in there and stab them with your bone spurs?'""Did Trump open the door with his comments? Sure. But ultimately, who cares? It's a hypothetical. We don't hire presidents to risk their lives fighting crime.The far more important question (covered by some) is how hard he will push the Hill do act on his gun proposals.The president repeated his determination to ban bump stocks. He said again that the country needs ""very strong"" background checks (""If I see a sicko, I don’t want him having a gun"") and to reform mental institutions.Trump continues to talk about arming trained teachers and others in school, although the other day he indicated that would be up to the states, which would mean no federal action.But as some journalists pointed out, Trump did not mention his plan to raise the age limit on buying assault-style weapons like the AR-15 from 18 to 21. He said last week that the NRA would go along, but the group continues to oppose the idea. So is the president backing off?In disclosing that he had lunch with top NRA officials, Trump told the governors ""they're on our side."" But he also said, ""If they're not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while. That's OK."" (Sarah Sanders said yesterday her boss still supports raising age limits on some guns.)If Trump, a vocal defender of the Second Amendment, does go up against the NRA, that would show a different kind of courage than running into a building under siege by a gunman."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/27/scary-stuff-how-fabricators-attacked-miami-paper-after-school-shooting.html","I am not in favor of censorship.And it's amazing that I have to say that, but there it is.What I'm opposed to are the dissemination of fabrications, bogus conspiracy theories and fake propaganda accounts that cause damage to individuals, to groups and to our country.The temperature level has of course shot way up in the wake of the Florida school shooting. And now comes a dramatic case study from Miami.McClatchy has a chilling report on one of its papers, the Miami Herald—chilling, that is, if you care about the future of journalism.Such tweets are designed to discredit the reporter and the newspaper through old-fashioned lies.That wasn't all. The perpetrator also managed ""to create a phony Miami Herald story — in the high tension following the Parkland shooting — saying that a Miami-Dade middle school faced threats of 'potentially catastrophic events' on upcoming dates, indicating that a new mass shooting was in the offing.""After screenshots of the fictitious story were shared on Twitter and Snapchat, Monique Madan, the Herald reporter whose byline was slapped on the story, said: ""It looks super real. They use the same font that we use. It has our masthead. It has my byline. If I were't a journalist, I wouldn’t think twice about it.""And talk about real-world consequences. Of course parents, students and teachers at the middle school would be scared by such a story and blame the Herald for fomenting fear.As technology makes it easier to create fake tweets, fake stories, even fake videos, the potential grows for undermining those who try to cover real news.We've also seen stark evidence of this as the Russians, during and since the 2016 campaign, have used bots and bogus accounts to try to disrupt American politics, first to push Donald Trump’s candidacy and most recently to exploit divisions over the Florida shooting.On Sunday’s ""Media Buzz,"" I questioned why Facebook, Google, YouTube and other social media sites can't do a better job of cracking down on fakery and propaganda. They've all admitted shortcomings and promised to do better, but one reason is that they don't want to invest the substantial sums that it would take.YouTube has apologized for inadvertently promoting a video calling Florida shooting survivor David Hogg an ""actor."" A 51-year-old Idaho man with under 1,000 followers posted footage of Hogg being interviewed by local TV last year for having witnessed a confrontation at a California beach—the clear implication being that he’s an actor who wasn’t really at the Parkland high school.That video drew more than 200,000 views and hit No. 1 on YouTube before apologizing and deleting it for violating policies against bullying and harassment.Conspiratorial stuff will always find an audience. But in an age when bad actors can use technology to literally fabricate the news, journalism outlets—including social media companies that profit from journalism—have to be constantly on guard."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/22/ex-playboy-models-notes-on-alleged-trump-affair-written-decade-later.html","EXCLUSIVE: The centerpiece of a New Yorker story on Karen McDougal, who says she had an affair with Donald Trump, is scribbled notes kept by the former Playboy playmate.These notes, obtained by journalist Ronan Farrow, are presented as her personal reflections on the relationship –“later memorialized in an eight-page, handwritten document provided to the New Yorker.”Readers could easily get the impression, as many journalists have, that McDougal wrote these notes during what she describes as a consensual relationship that began in 2006. But that is not the case.The New Yorker does not dispute that McDougal's notes were written many years after the alleged relationship. Instead, the magazine attempted to tie them to McDougal's eventual deal with the National Enquirer's parent company, American Media Inc. “The article does not present Karen McDougal’s written account as being made simultaneously with the events themselves,” a New Yorker spokesperson told me. “Rather, the article makes clear that the idea to sell her story to American Media Inc. first occurred in 2016. Furthermore, her written account is supported by additional sourcing and documentation referenced in the article.” The more recent creation of the notes doesn’t mean that McDougal isn’t telling the truth. The magazine’s view is that the timing has no material impact on her credibility.But the timing of the notes is revealing about how McDougal came to go public, as well as about the role of the National Enquirer.The McDougal passages were written on a notebook marketed by fashion designer Izak Zenou, whose name appears at the bottom of one of the pages. He got into the business of creating office supplies in 2016, and the notebook was not available for sale on Amazon until March 2016.The timing is significant.Farrow writes that “the interactions that McDougal outlines in the document share striking similarities with the stories of other women who claim to have had sexual relationships with Trump, or who have accused him of propositioning them for sex or sexually harassing them.”But in writing the notes in 2016 or 2017, the onetime Playmate of the Year did not foreshadow, by a decade, similar accusations by other women.  The notes say such things as: “I was into his intelligence + charm. Such a polite man. We talked for a couple of hours—then, it was ‘ON’! We got naked + had sex.”After the New Yorker story was published last week, a White House spokesperson said: “This is an old story that is just more fake news. The president says he never had a relationship with McDougal.”American Media’s CEO, David Pecker, has acknowledged his friendship with Trump. The New Yorker quotes former two former AMI executives on the record as saying that buying and killing stories was a common practice under Pecker.McDougal and her lawyer met with Dylan Howard, American Media’s chief content officer, to discuss a deal. McDougal told AMI that she had been offered more than $1 million for her story, and also that she was in discussions with ABC News.The Enquirer maintains that it didn’t publish McDougal’s allegations about Trump in 2016 because it couldn’t confirm them, and that she offered no documentation, texts, receipts or corroborating witnesses. She was even told to search her storage for old phones or other evidence.The supermarket tabloid also says she did not offer any handwritten notes, which suggests they hadn’t been written at the time.During the discussions McDougal appeared to change her view about going public with the alleged affair, saying, “I don’t want to be viewed as the next Monica Lewinsky.”That makes the timing of the Enquirer’s $150,000 deal with McDougal, in August 2016, all the more suspicious, especially given the paper’s pro-Trump coverage under Pecker. The contract, in addition to the limited life rights, called for her to appear on two AMI magazine covers and write a fitness column, but some of those goals have not been met.So the company paid her big bucks even after concluding she couldn’t substantiate the affair, while making sure she couldn’t tell the story elsewhere.McDougal’s contract with American Media included a non-disclosure agreement, and that may explain the vital role of the handwritten notes.The ex-Playmate spoke on the record to Farrow, but the piece says she declined to discuss details of her relationship with Trump “for fear of violating the agreement.”That obstacle, intentionally or not, was neatly circumvented by the handwritten notes.Farrow writes that he obtained the document from John Crawford, a friend of McDougal, and “she expressed surprise” that he had it but confirmed that the notes were in her handwriting.Yet later in the piece, it became apparent that they are more than just friends.Crawford told Farrow “that selling McDougal’s story was his idea, and that he first raised it when she was living with him, in 2016.” As they watched the presidential candidate on television, Crawford said he told McDougal that her past relationship with Trump “could be worth something about now.”In an interview with CNN, Farrow called McDougal’s notes “written testimony” and said they exist because “in the course of selling the story, a friend of hers who coaxed her into selling it said sit down and write every detail.”(Two months after McDougal signed the contract with American Media, Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to Stormy Daniels, a former porn star who had claimed in an interview years earlier that she had an affair with Trump in 2006. Since that transaction was accompanied by a non-disclosure agreement, the payment has been widely viewed as hush money. Cohen recently told the New York Times that he paid Daniels out of his pocket and was not reimbursed by Trump or his campaign.)American Media told the New Yorker in a letter last week that a post-election amendment to McDougal’s contract allows her to respond to legitimate press inquiries about Trump. An AMI executive has now asked New Yorker Editor David Remnick for a correction, saying he had an obligation to tell readers that McDougal’s notes were written at least 10 years after the alleged affair. The executive said the omission was intentionally misleading.Remnick, a widely respected journalist and Pulitzer Prize-winning author who is also an ardent critic of Trump, responded that his magazine stands by its story. He said the story made clear the long time lapse between the alleged affair and the effort to sell the story. Remnick also said the New Yorker had disclosed Crawford’s role and included AMI’s responses.Farrow has gained enormous journalistic credibility for his meticulous New Yorker exposes of sexual misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein by numerous actresses and the movie mogul’s attempts to intimidate the press. His detailed reporting on McDougal and Trump fits that pattern.Still, some journalists reached the understandable conclusion that McDougal’s notes were composed back in 2006. Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen wrote this week that McDougal “handwrote a contemporaneous account of her alleged affair.”Time, in a common formulation, said that “a former Playboy model kept handwritten notes about an alleged nine-month affair with President Donald Trump that began in 2006.”The Week said that “McDougal's friend John Crawford supplied Farrow with McDougal's handwritten notes from the time, which detail the affair.”The reality is that at least a decade had passed before Karen McDougal wrote those notes, after her friend and roommate urged her to peddle her story for money. "
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/02/22/trumps-early-move-on-guns-could-bridge-partisan-gap.html","Donald Trump could be the president who pushes Congress to do something about gun control, even if those steps are modest.Perhaps only a Republican president—and one elected with the full backing of the NRA—would be positioned to take such steps.But rather than welcoming Trump's move in their direction, gun control advocates are initially dismissing his efforts as inadequate.Even after the school shooting in Newtown, even with Barack Obama and Joe Biden mounting a sustained push for some gun-control measures, Congress did nothing. There was no way the Republicans were going to give Obama even a minor concession on the issue.Then came last year's Las Vegas massacre, and an outcry over the shooter's use of bump stocks to boost the speed of his attack. But nothing happened.When the conservative, pro-Trump New York Post is running such banner headlines as ""MR. PRESIDENT, PLEASE ACT"" and yesterday’s ""HOPE FOR GUN CONTROL""—with a photo of protesting Florida students--it's clear that the national mood is changing.Even Pat Robertson, the onetime GOP presidential candidate, said on his ""700 Club"": ""I am a gun owner. I have hunted. I have shot skeet,"" Robertson said. ""But for heaven's sakes, I don't think that the general population needs to have automatic weapons.""Trump has ordered the Justice Department to speed up an existing review and issue regulations banning bump stocks. He has also signaled he is open to arguments about tighter background checks and raising the age limit for purchases of such weapons as an AR-15 rifle, the one used in Parkland.This comes from a president who embraced the Second Amendment during the campaign and said of the group that backed him financially: ""To the NRA, I can proudly say I will never, ever let you down.""Of course, after yesterday's gut-wrenching session with students, teachers and parents who went through mass shootings, Trump also said that arming people in schools could be part of the solution--an approach favored by the NRA.A Quinnipiac poll out yesterday said that 97 percent (!) of Americans favor universal background checks for gun purchases. Some 66 percent favor stricter gun laws, and 67 percent favor a ban on assault weapons.There is a partisan divide, with only 34 percent of Republicans supporting stricter gun laws, but 43 percent back an assault weapons ban.Washington's paralysis on these issues speaks to more than the clout of the NRA. Many lawmakers are just afraid of alienating gun owners, who are passionate and highly motivated voters.Now it's true the NRA doesn't oppose some of these measures, such as regulating bump stocks (though it doesn't want legislative action on the matter).But Trump does have a Nixon-goes-to-China opportunity here. He could detoxify the issue for many Republicans, bringing enough along to join with liberal Democrats in passing modest legislation.It's just as possible that, like immigration, this issue will become embroiled in partisanship and the moment will pass.Trump has already remade the Republican Party in his image, drawing considerable criticism from those who don't like him or his policies. But what if, in the wake of the Florida tragedy, he moved the party toward a more centrist and popular position?"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/03/06/reformer-saudi-prince-first-trip-abroad/","Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) began his first trip outside the kingdom in his official capacity as future king this week, aiming to woo support from leaders in Egypt, the U.K., and the U.S. amid sweeping reforms he is implementing across his country.The Guardian reports:When he arrives in London on Wednesday, Prince Mohammed will be received as head-of-state-in-waiting, and will travel to Windsor Castle for a dinner with the Queen. As a senior member of Britain’s most important trading partner in the Middle East, he will also arrive with a twin agenda: as head of a lucrative trade mission, and as a leader looking for validation after a checkered debut year in foreign affairs.…Elsewhere, in diplomatic and regional circles, Prince Mohammed’s embrace of Donald Trump and his embattled son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has been described as “a beginner’s mistake,” which has undermined efforts to counter Iran.The first stop of his tour was Egypt, where the prince arrived on Sunday and was greeted by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi as he got off his plane.Al Jazeera reports:His visit comes a day after Egypt’s top court upheld a deal to transfer two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia. The agreement was first announced during a visit to Cairo in April 2016 by Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, during which he announced a multi-billion-dollar package of investments and soft loans for Egypt.Following the signing of the deal, widespread protests broke out across Egypt. Opponents of the agreement said it amounted to selling off Egypt’s sovereign powers and that it violated the constitution, which bars the surrender of any territory.Along with its allies the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Kuwait, Saudi Arabia has reportedly provided billions of dollars to support Sisi.The 32-year-old future Saudi king reportedly discussed trade, the ongoing conflict in Yemen—where a kingdom-led coalition has been combating Iranian-allied Houthis since 2015—and rival Iran with the Egyptian president.MBS is expected to travel to the U.K. next.According to the Week, the British are expected to roll out the red carpet for the crown prince, whose father has granted him free rein to implement some of the most sweeping reforms for Saudi that the conservative Muslim country has experienced in almost 40 years.Some of those changes include a crackdown on corruption that has swept in members of the royal family, and even clerics, as well as changes to what women are allowed to do.In the U.K., Crown Prince Salman is scheduled to meet with the queen for dinner at Windsor Castle before meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May.The Week reports:The talks are aimed at strengthening defense, security and economic ties between the U.K. and Saudi Arabia, but “given how little we know about him and how important our relations with Saudi Arabia are held to be, it is fair to say that breaths are being held on both sides,” the Times reports.Demonstrations are set to take place outside Downing Street, with campaigners calling on May to challenge Prince Mohammed on human rights abuses and to suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia.U.S. President Trump has welcomed the reforms at the hands of the prospective king.MBS’s trip comes while U.S.-backed Saudi Arabia continues to be embroiled in the ongoing war in Yemen that has killed thousands, including many civilians, left millions in the grip of famine, and has cost the kingdom an estimated $8 billion.Saudi Arabia is expected to continue working with the United States to prevent Iran’s growing influence in the Middle East.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Bush official Karl Rove and House Speaker Paul Ryan are begging President Trump’s administration to water-down proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.During a press briefing on Tuesday, Ryan — an avid free-trader — said he opposed Trump’s proposed 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum, asking the White House to be “more targeted” on trade.Specifically, Ryan said the administration should be only going after China on trade, rather than imposing global tariffs on steel and aluminum.NEW: Speaker Paul Ryan, who has been critical on Pres.

[Emphasis added]On Fox Business, Rove echoed Ryan’s statements against Trump’s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, saying he had a “bad reaction” to the populist trade initiative. Rove, like Ryan, says Trump should be solely going after China..@KarlRove on tariffs: ""I've got a bad reaction to it. I thought the issue here was China and China's dumping of steel, so we're going to get at China by hurting our allies… This ought to be more narrowly targeted."" pic.twitter.com/EZ4jpn6Ymu— FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) March 6, 2018I thought the issue here was China and China’s dumping of steel, so we’re going to get at China by hurting our allies, neighbors, Mexico and Canada,” Rove said. “This ought to be more narrowly targeted. This ought to be focused on the abuse.” [Emphasis added]Ryan and Rove were two of the biggest Republican defenders and advocates for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, also supported by former President Obama, which Trump campaigned hard against and ultimately killed by executive action, saving millions of American jobs in the process.In November 2015, when Trump was already campaigning against TPP, Ryan continued defending the multinational free trade agreement which was expected to not only eliminate millions of U.S. working and middle-class jobs, but also drive down wages for remaining American workers.Ryan said at the time that TPP had “great potential.”In the same month that Ryan was continuing to promote TPP, Rove wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal where he railed against Trump for opposing the multinational free trade agreement.“Mr. Trump’s worst moment came when he attacked the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal,” Rove wrote, defending TPP.Ryan and Rove’s attacks on Trump’s tariffs are similar to those by the White House’s trade globalists, including adviser Gary Cohn, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and Defense Secretary James Mattis. As Breitbart News reported, the band of trade globalists desperately tried to stop Trump from proposing the aluminum and steel tariffs but failed.Meanwhile, one of Trump’s close economic nationalist allies in the White House, Peter Navarro, told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that “it’s going to be a great day for America” when Trump signs the new tariffs into law. Navarro also blasted the free trade absolutism of the Democratic and Republican establishment, multinational corporations, and mainstream media.“I think the record is clear on these free trade agreements,” Navarro said. “They always are done with promises for significant jobs for Americans and significant access to markets, and we always lose dramatically once the ink is signed.”Multinational free trade agreements have been responsible for massive manufacturing outsourcing and job loss over the last two decades. For example, the KORUS free trade agreement has displaced at least 60,000 American workers since its enactment in 2007.Meanwhile, since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect in the 1990s, at least one million net U.S. jobs have been lost because of the free trade deal. Between 2000 and 2014, there have been about five million manufacturing jobs lost across the country as trade deficits continue soaring.One former steel town in West Virginia lost 94 percent of its steel jobs because of NAFTA, with nearly 10,000 workers in the town being displaced from the steel industry. Since China entered the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001, there have been 3.2 million American jobs lost with 2.4 million of those jobs coming from the U.S. manufacturing sector.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/03/06/manning-trumps-tariffs-key-long-term-plan-revitalize-u-s-manufacturing/","Tariffs on aluminum and steel imports are key to revitalizing domestic manufacturing industries, said Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, in a Monday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with co-hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.Combined with regulatory and tax reform for energy production, the implementation of tariffs on aluminum and steel imports will make America a lucrative option for manufacturing operations, said Manning.“In today’s world, as opposed to ten to twelve years ago, we have the potential to be the dominant energy producer in the world,” said Manning. “Between natural gas, coal, and oil, we have the potential of being the dominant — repeat, dominant — energy producer in the world. That means cheap energy [and] cheap electricity are real possibilities, as opposed to what Obama’s policy was, which was to drive up the cost of electricity. Electricity drives industry. So if you have inexpensive electricity [and] raw materials available — steel, aluminum, things that you build things with — and you have those available in supply and domestically created … and you have a road system, which we have, and you’re close to market, there’s no reason for anybody to build a factory anywhere but in the United States of America, at least to service the American economy. That’s one of the critical pieces of this.”America doubles or triples its share of global aluminum and steel production via Trump’s economic policies, said Manning.“The reward is, as opposed to producing 1.5 percent of the world’s steel, the United States creates a vibrant steel industry [and] a vibrant aluminum industry,” Manning stated. “Suddenly, we are able to produce 2.5 percent, 3 percent, 5 percent of [global] steel and aluminum. We’ll have a domestic supply, which makes it a more stable supply.”Pollak asked Manning why a resurgence in manufacturing had not occurred during the second Bush administration’s imposition of steel tariffs between 2002 and 2003. According to Manning, President Donald Trump is ushering in a more competitive economic environment than what was seen during the early years of the second Bush presidency.“We still had a punitive tax policy in place [in 2002 and 2003],” replied Manning. “We didn’t have a robust energy industry, so we were dependent on importing energy at extreme levels, and as a result, a lot of the component parts were not there to rebuild an industry like steel, which is heavily dependent on electricity, which is an intensive industry in terms of labor costs and the costs of building those factories. What we have now is a different environment because of the tax reform, which Paul Ryan was instrumental in getting.”Manning continued, “We now have a competitive tax environment because of President Trump’s aggressive dismantling of Obama’s regulations. We have a much more competitive regulatory environment, at least compared to five years ago. … We have a vision at the top of wanting not just a temporary fix, but to really create an environment where industries can thrive. [We are] identifying key industries like the steel [and] aluminum industries that have really dwindled over the last twenty years … as key components that need to be secure and need be growing within our country. We now have an economic plan that’s geared towards trying to allow those industries to build. President Bush was never committed to using [steel tariffs] as a means to cause more steel factories to grow. It was a political maneuver, as proved by the short-term nature of [the Bush-era tariffs]. This is not a political maneuver [by Donald Trump].”China avoided existing tariffs on aluminum imports via transshipping — a term used to describe the surreptitious movement of goods to hide their origins — its aluminum to America via Mexico, said Manning.Last week, Curtis Ellis, senior policy adviser for America First Policies, similarly pointed to Mexico’s use of transshipping in an interview with Mansour and Pollak on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight. “China has overproduced its steel [and] aluminum, and they have gamed the system again [by] stockpiling aluminum in the Mexican desert, transshipping it through Mexico and through Canada, taking advantage of the low tariff rates, thanks to NAFTA.”Manning pointed to a report from the Wall Street Journal detailing allegations of China’s use of transshipping to facilitate its dumping of aluminum and steel.“Let me just give you a simple thing that’s happened with aluminum. This was in the Wall Street Journal, hardly a newspaper that’s well-known for supporting protectionist policies or for increased tariffs. Here’s what the Wall Street Journal reported about nine months ago,” said Manning. “In Mexico, they found a massive storage facility which turned out to be owned by a major Chinese aluminum producer, where they had stored an incredible amount of aluminum that was just across the border that would be exported as if it was being exported from Mexico under NAFTA rather than from China directly. They did it that way so they could benefit from the lower NAFTA tariffs and to hide the amount of exported aluminum from China directly to the United States by funneling it through other countries so it appears as though China wasn’t cornering the market through a dumping policy. That’s what they did, and that’s what they’ve done with steel.”Unchanged, the status quo of aluminum and steel trade will eliminate America’s aluminum and steel industries and affiliated manufacturing, Manning said. “If we continue doing the same thing that we’ve been doing, we know the results. And the results will be, we won’t have a steel or aluminum industry. We know we won’t have a factory base if we keep doing the same thing.”“Globalists” are unconcerned with the plight of non-coastal Americans who do not work in the technology or finance industries, according to Manning. Trump’s policies will benefit those who “make stuff,” “grow things,” and “take things out of the ground,” he added.“[Degrading America’s manufacturing industries] is okay to people who believe in globalism because they believe that’s a more vibrant system where resources are allocated more effectively,” Manning said. “I would argue that they’re wrong because they’re not dealing with real-world situations, and it also has the impact of lowering average U.S. wages on the whole [because] a vast number of people don’t work on the coasts in tech or in finance. The vast majority of people have to work in places where they make stuff or they grow things or they take things out of the ground. And those things are the things we’ve exported and made illegal here in America by virtue of our environmental laws, our tax laws, and it makes more sense to do it elsewhere and to transfer the environmental risk elsewhere. We’ve basically hollowed out America in many respects, and by doing that, we’ve created a problem in our country, and Donald Trump was the answer to that problem, and the people who created it, they think it’s actually good that those things have occurred, and those people should just move to the city.”Asked by Pollak about increased costs of living for Americans via tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, Manning was dismissive. “For all those people worrying about price Armageddon, this is equivalent to about a penny-and-a-half on a six-pack of Coors,” Manning said. “It’s about $35-70 on a vehicle, on a car – increased cost due to the tariff.”Breitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).LISTEN:Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/06/catholic-church-reports-spike-in-demonic-activity-italy-requests-exorcists-have-tripled/","According to recent reports, the number of people in Italy calling on exorcists for assistance to fight demonic activity has tripled, reaching nearly a half million per year.In a recent interview, Sicilian exorcist Father Benigno Palilla told Vatican Radio that more and more Italians are engaging in occult activities, which often serve as a gateway to the demonic.About a quarter of Italy’s adult population regularly visits astrologers, psychics, and tarot card readers, according to the consumer organization Codacons. It is precisely these sorts of activities, Father Benigno Palilla said, that “open the door to the devil and to possession.”Citing experts in the field, Vatican Radio said that some half a million persons request assistance from exorcists each year in Italy. Although many of these face other sorts of psychological afflictions rather than suffering from demonic activity, nonetheless the diabolical phenomenon itself has been “rising sharply.”The Catholic Church in Sicily has just finished a four-day formation course aimed at preparing priests to deal with spiritual combat involving Satan. “We touch on the most burning issues: from Satanic cults to previously possessed persons who recount the story of their liberation,” said Father Palilla. The priest is a firm believer in ongoing priestly formation as a fundamental weapon in the fight against the Evil One.“A self-taught exorcist will certainly make mistakes,” he said. “It requires a period of apprenticeship, as happens in many other professions.”Seminary formation too often skips over important areas, such as how to deal with real cases of possession, the priest asserts.“We priests frequently don’t know how to address concrete cases that we are faced with,” he said. “In our preparation for the priesthood, these things are not covered, and consequently we don’t know how to evangelize properly. In reality, people possessed by demons are the ‘existential peripheries’ that Pope Francis is pushing us toward.”Next month the Regina Apostolorum University in Rome will host its annual course on exorcism and demonic activity, featuring Vatican officials, exorcists, psychologists, physicians and other experts as speakers.The university is a pioneer in such material, Vatican Radio notes, having been the first institution to offer such a program back in 2006. Now its annual courses are always full, drawing between 150 and 200 students, comprising priests, religious sisters, pastoral workers, teachers and doctors.According to the founder of the program, Father Pedro Barrajon, the exceptional interest in the course reflects a growing awareness of the activity of the devil in the world, and a concern on the part of bishops to have some of their priests specially trained for dealing for this reality.Father Barrajon told Breitbart News that years ago the devil was downplayed so much that few bothered even to speak of demonic activity. For a while, he said, it was typical to explain away even the many accounts of demonic possession in the gospel as well as the episodes of Jesus driving out demons, “attributing them to the ignorance of the age and a readiness to recur to supernatural causes to explain diseases like epilepsy or psychological disorders.”While that may be true in certain cases, Barrajon said, “it certainly doesn’t eliminate the clear references to the activity of the devil throughout the gospels,” something that “is generally recognized now by scholars.”“Jesus obviously believed in the devil,” he said.Follow Thomas D.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/06/donald-trump-vs-the-world-globalists-rise-up-against-trump-tariffs/","A growing force of free trade globalists are working inside and outside the White House to stop President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs, while White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is trying to promote them.“It’s Peter Navarro, Wilbur Ross, and President Trump against the world,” a source with close ties to the White House told Breitbart News.Cohn lost the battle against Navarro after Trump announced the tariffs in spite of his advice. But Cohn is determined not to lose the war, working to appeal to the president’s deal-making nature to reduce the impact of the tariffs.On Monday night, news leaked to Politico of Cohn’s effort to get corporate opponents of the president’s proposed tariffs a meeting with the president, frustrated that Trump was not listening to his advice.House Speaker Paul Ryan signaled concern about the tariffs in phone calls with the president but said the substance of the conversations will remain private.“We’ve had multiple conversations about this, he knows our view. Every now and then we’re just going to have a different approach as to how we tackle these problems, but it should be acknowledged there is a problem that needs to be addressed here,” Ryan said in a press conference on Tuesday.Ryan called for action “more surgical and more targeted,” than universal tariffs, pointing to the problem of countries like China “dumping” subsidized steel and aluminum on the American market.Another Washington opponent of the tariffs is former Bush budget director Josh Bolten — now a high-powered and well-paid lobbyist as CEO of Business Roundtable.Bolten has mobilized top CEOs who supported Trump’s tax cuts against his proposed trade measures.“Business Roundtable CEOs are making the case directly to President Trump and his trade and economic policy advisors,” a spokeswoman told FOX Business.Trump allies are astounded at how brazenly Cohn is working to undermine the president’s trade agenda since it was a big reason why he won the election.As the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, Cohn is well-sourced with high-powered business allies and knows how to wage war behind the scenes, using the media and the business community. Navarro and Ross have tried to counter critics by dismissing the hysterics on cable news.Outside Trump allies believe White House aides who were upset by the tariff announcement last week leaked suggestions that it was the result of an unstable president frustrated with media coverage of his son-in-law Jared Kushner.Cohn appears comfortable in the administration, despite rumors that he plans to leave after the successful push for tax cuts. Trump, however, has told advisers that Cohn will leave if the tariffs are enacted, according to Bloomberg News.A White House spokesperson declined a request for comment from Breitbart News.Trump supporters like economist Larry Kudlow are urging Cohn to stay and fight.“I have to tell you, personally, I am urging Gary Cohn to stay and fight for another day. He’s done a great job,” Kudlow told CNBC. Kudlow opposes the president’s positions on tariffs, but admits that Trump is determined to make changes on trade.Global leaders have also called to express their concerns about Trump’s proposed tariffs. A Downing Street spokesperson noted that Prime Minister Theresa May “raised our deep concern” about the proposed tariffs on Sunday. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Trump to discuss his concerns about trade.Despite the forces mobilizing against Trump, he remains resolute to move forward on tariffs.“We’re not backing down,” Trump told reporters on Monday.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

The suspect reportedly told officials that his wife left home at 9:30 PM on the 21st leaving behind all her personal belongings — including her cell phone, medication, and purse.Terry then said that his missing wife texted a friend saying, “Will u plz come pick me up. 911.” A second text reportedly read, “I’ll do anything. I need u plz.”But when police became involved, shocking photos of the woman’s dead body were discovered on the suspect’s phone.Police report that the woman “appeared to be deceased” in the photos and was seen naked and bloodied. The photos showed severe facial trauma and a gunshot wound to the abdomen, police said.Forensics experts noted that the floors in the couple’s home had been cleaned with bleach but the team still found some tiny blood spattering on a living room wall. However, the missing woman’s body has not yet been found.Several firearms were recovered from the home, and police pointed out that as a convicted felon, Terry is not allowed to own firearms.Records show that Terry was arrested in Colorado on suspicion of attempting to kill his wife, but the charges were dropped when Chrystal refused to press charges.Based on the evidence found by the forensics team and the photos on his cell phone, police charged Terry with a series of counts including second-degree murder.

Even if he was doing her wrong,” neighbor Jay Meltesen told KPTV.Court documents state that Javier placed the 911 call herself at 2 a.m. Saturday and told authorities she thought she fatally stabbed her boyfriend with a sword, KCPQ reported.Police say they found blood spattered on the walls and Lovell bleeding out in the bedroom. Lovell was rushed to a local hospital, where he remains in critical condition.Investigators report that they seized the samurai sword and several knives at the crime scene.Authorities arrested Javier and booked her on attempted murder charges at the Clark County Jail. She is being held on $350,000 bail and is due back in court March 13 for an arraignment hearing, the Columbian reported.Police say they suspect Javier’s motivation for stabbing Lovell was jealousy.“I was trying to kill him for cheating.

Executives at companies that use the metals to build their products, including automakers and other manufacturing companies, have expressed a desire to meet with Trump to head off the tariffs.Trump, however, is standing by his call for the tariffs. On Monday, the president said “we’re not backing down” on the plan to put a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum.Trump’s tariffs announcement last week was a major setback for Cohn, who Trump refers to as “globalist Gary” in private conversations. Cohn has fought tariff plans for months, combating administration officials such as trade adviser Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross who think the U.S. must do more to protect its economy from predatory policies of foreign countries, particularly China.But those internal battles took on even more urgency and became more heated in recent weeks after the Commerce Department published the findings of its Section 232 investigations. Those probes found that foreign imports of steel and aluminum were such a burden on domestic producers of the metals that they are creating a threat to national security. It recommended a variety of trade sanctions to protect the ability of the U.S. to maintain domestic steel and aluminum production.Cohn no longer believes it is possible to stop the tariffs altogether, one person familiar with the matter told Breitbart News. Now efforts are aimed at narrowing the scope of the tariffs, focusing them more closely on “bad actors” such as China.Similar efforts are underway on Capitol Hill. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday that he would urge the president to adopt a “more surgical” approach to tariffs and to specifically address China and other abusers of global trade rules.Many conservatives and Republicans remain wedded to a very ideological view of global trade and have knee-jerk reactions to proposals to restrict trade or impose sanctions, even when those may be necessary for national security. Club for Growth, a conservative pro-free market group, has warned that tariffs will hurt the economy. Sen. Mike Lee, the Utah Republican, is pushing a bill to limit the president’s ability to impose tariffs.Republican presidential primary voters in 2015 rejected nearly a score of candidates who held pro-free trade views, favoring the economic nationalist policies advocated by Donald Trump. Proponents of the tariffs point out that failing to live up Trump’s promises on trade would hurt the Republican party in the midterm elections and possibly endanger Trump’s chances of being re-elected in 2020.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

It also outlaws private gun sales, with an exception for family members. It was originally introduced in response to the December 14, 2012, attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School but was defeated when Americans figured out the bill, if it had been law, would have done nothing to prevent the attack from occurring.Manchin’s bill would not have prevented the February 14, 2018, Florida school shooting from occurring either.Yet the Washington Times reports that Manchin wants Trump to use “his gun control bill as a base for how to address the issue of gun violence.”Manchin said Tuesday, “It’s a good base bill.

Davis (D-IL) is pushing legislation to place a 20 percent tax on guns and a 50 percent tax on ammunition.The legislation is titled the “Gun Violence Prevention and Safe Communities Act of 2018.”The act amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, so as to require a 20 percent tax on “pistols,” “revolvers,” “firearms (other than pistols and revolvers),” and “any lower frame or receiver for a firearm, whether for a semiautomatic pistol, rifle, or shotgun that is designed to accommodate interchangeable upper receivers.”The act places a 50 percent tax on ammunition “shells and cartridges.”These taxes will only apply to law-abiding citizens, just as similar taxes in Chicago and Seattle only raise the purchase price of firearms and ammunition for law-abiding citizens. Both Chicago and Seattle have a “violence tax” on the retail sale of guns and ammo, but criminals do not participate in the tax because they do not buy their guns at retail.This ultimately means that such taxes drive up the prices for the tools that law-abiding citizens need for self-defense, even to the point of making firearms cost-prohibitive for poorer residents.Rep. Davis’s act makes clear that no “department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States shall be subject to any tax imposed on the sale or transfer” of firearms and ammunition. In other words, law-abiding citizens will be taxed on the tools they need for self-defense but the taxpayer-funded security personnel guarding the political class will not have to pay the new taxes.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

As secretary of state, Clinton chose to use a private, non-secure server for government business.”Outside of the obvious security implications, another reason this is important comes down to the statement disgraced former-FBI Director James Comey made when he went out of his way to let Clinton off the hook during the 2016 presidential campaign.In July of 2016, Comey reassured us that, “With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked.” (emphasis added)But, as we now know, between May and June, Comey’s statement was also edited from a hack of Clinton’s server being “reasonably likely” to merely “possible.”“Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail account,” he said before clearing her of any legal wrongdoing.We also know that Strzok was responsible for the language in this statement that was downgraded from “grossly negligent” (a criminal offense) to “extremely careless.”If these Fox’s sources are correct — and an Inspector General’s report on the FBI’s handling of its investigation into Clinton’s server is expected to tell us soon either way — outside of Strzok’s possible malfeasance, what did Comey know when he assured us there was no “direct evidence” of a hack?

The regime has also denied that it is supplying arms and missile technology to Houthi rebels in Yemen and, despite evidence showing otherwise, that the ballistic missiles that were fired into Saudi Arabia from Yemen were not theirs.In December, Iran claimed that United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley “fabricated” her announcement that the charred remains of a short-range ballistic missile discovered in Yemen, which was prominently displayed behind her during her speech, originated in Iran.That same month, an independent panel to the U.N. Security Council declared, “Design characteristics and dimensions of the components inspected by the panel are consistent with those reported for the Iranian designed and manufactured Qiam-1 missile.”Last week, ahead of his trip to Iran this week, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian’s said at a news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that Iran’s ballistic missiles program “worries us enormously.” He reportedly added, “Having such tools is not uniquely defensive, given the distance they can reach.”In October, Iran said it has no need to increase the range of its ballistic missiles because they were already capable of reaching U.S. forces stationed in the region.Adelle Nazarian is a politics and national security reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/03/06/manning-death-steel-industry-leaves-u-s-vulnerable-blackmail-china/","Rick Manning, president of Americans for Limited Government, discussed America’s aluminum and steel industries in an interview Monday on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with co-hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak. Destruction of America’s aluminum and steel industries via Chinese commodity dumping would leave America “vulnerable to blackmail on key component parts” needed for the U.S. to have “a modern industrial economy,” Manning said.Once China controls the world’s steel production, explained Manning, “the risk is the cost when the Chinese decide, ‘We’re not going to sell you steel, and you can’t build stuff anymore because you’re a threat to our Chinese economy.’”Predatory pricing of aluminum and steel exports are part of a broader Chinese strategy to destroy America’s industrial capacity via increasing its dependence on China, said Manning.“The Chinese are engaged in war,” said Manning. “They make no bones about it that they’re engaged in war, and they’re using dumping and every other tool at their disposal to degrade our economy and our capacity to act independently. Our capacity to act independently is our greatest strength. We’ve been blessed with great natural resources [and] an economic system that’s designed to grow and create innovation. … Those blessings that we’ve received, they’re our strength [and] our power. The Chinese are attempting to make us dependent upon them or others by degrading various key industries of ours that are key to being able to defend ourselves downstream and to have an independent economy.”Continuance of America’s growing dependence on Chinese steel imports will leave America vulnerable to Chinese blackmail over the supply of an essential industrial commodity, said Manning. President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on steel imports would allow domestic steel manufacturers and interrelated industries to thrive, he added.“The risk is the cost when the Chinese decide, ‘We’re not going to sell you steel, and you can’t build stuff anymore because you’re a threat to our Chinese economy,'” said Manning. “That’s the risk. You make a small investment … to rebuild a domestic industry that’s been harmed by Chinese dumping and allow that industry to grow and thrive and create an environment where we aren’t vulnerable to blackmail on key component parts to having a modern industrial economy.”Protection of domestic aluminum and steel manufacturers from Chinese economic predation is a matter of national security, Manning said.“We have a real problem if you do not have steel [or] aluminum and you don’t have the capacity to domestically manufacture that,” said Manning. “You have a national security threat. The last people we need to be dependent upon to be able to produce airplanes and vehicles are the Chinese, who are engaged in asymmetrical war against our country. Until we come to grips with the fact that they’re playing for keeps and we’re playing like nothing’s happening, until we wake up to that, we’re going to face an untenable situation.”“Globalists” are mistaken in viewing increasing international economic interdependence as a growing bulwark against war, Manning warned.“For some people, it’s okay [to destroy America’s steelmaking industry] because in a globalist world, the way it works is: you allocate resources where it makes the most sense for those resources to be allocated,” said Manning. “So it’s okay for the United States not to have the capacity to have steel mills because we can always get it some somewhere else. It assumes a stable environment. It’s really very kind of dreamy to think that because we’re all interdependent economically, that we can never afford to go to war.

Bush-appointed Judge Titus, in a 30-page opinion, rejected similar arguments and dismissed the claims of Casa de Maryland, an illegal alien advocacy group based in the capital beltway.The crux of the difference in the rulings is that Titus admits the possibility that DACA itself is unconstitutional, as the nearly identical Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy was already found to be by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Fifth Circuit. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have both publicly supported the view that DACA is similarly illegal. That belief forms the basis of the Department of Homeland Security’s stated reasoning for ending DACA.Finding that DACA was amost certainly legal, the California and New York courts then referenced President Donald Trump’s campaign statements as evidence the decision was not made for permissible reasons. Titus did not accept this reasoning, writing, “As disheartening or inappropriate as the President’s occasionally disparaging remarks may be, they are not relevant to the larger issues governing the DACA rescission.”Titus also refuses to allow the use of Trump’s statements to sustain any of the constitutional challenges brought under the Fifth Amendment. Neither of the first two cases definitely reached the constitutional claims Titus ruled against because they found a sufficient likelihood of success on the APA claim.Judge Titus, however, despite reaffirming the principle under which Obama’s executive amnesty was rescinded, took the opportunity to make clear that he was unequivocally pro-amnesty, referring to the illegals covered by DACA repeatedly as “Dreamers,” disparaging the president throughout, and writing, for example:For over a decade at the start of the 21st century, Congress quarreled over policies regarding illegal aliens who entered the country as children, and who may have no memory or connection with their country of origin. Would the world’s beacon of freedom—a nation founded by immigrants—cast out an immigrant population that was likely brought here without choice and who likely now knows no other home? While “no” would seem to be the obvious answer, ordinary logic has eluded our Congress.Judge Titus ends his opinion with an unguarded political proclamation. “This Court does not like the outcome of this case, but is constrained by its constitutionally limited role to the result that it has reached,” he writes. “Hopefully, the Congress and the President will finally get their job done.”Department of Justice spokesman Devin O’Malley issued the following response to his department’s win:The Department of Justice has long maintained that DHS acted within its lawful authority in making the discretionary decision to wind down DACA in an orderly manner, and we welcome the good news today that the district court in Maryland strongly agrees.Today’s decision also highlights a serious problem with the disturbing growth in the use of nationwide injunctions, which causes the Maryland court’s correct judgment in favor of the government to be undermined by the overbroad injunctions that have been entered by courts in other states.Despite these hurdles, the Justice Department will continue to defend the promotion and enforcement of the rule of law, which is so vital to protecting a nation, its borders, and its citizens.The case is Casa de Maryland v.

The Chronicle notes that Farrell “was the lone supervisor to oppose putting Prop. N on the ballot in 2016, calling it a ‘slippery slope.’”When asked if ICE would potentially subpoena voter rolls to go after illegal immigrants in the city, an agency spokesman reportedly said, “no comment.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/the-full-nunberg-ex-trump-aide-defies-mueller-in-media-tirade/","Former Trump aide Sam Nunberg had a full day of media availability Monday after a grand jury working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller subpoened him.Nunberg gave a series of interviews claiming he would refuse to cooperate – leaving some, like FOX Business’s Charlie Gasparino, asking if he was “of sound mind.”The Washington, DC, grand jury empaneled by Mueller sent Nunberg, one of President Donald Trump’s earliest enlisted – and earliest dismissed – campaign aides, a detailed subpoena over the weekend.It requested his complete communications with the president himself, ex-Breitbart News Executive Chairman and Trump campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon, one-time campaign chairman Corey Lewandowski, Roger Stone, Carter Page, recently resigned White House Communications director Hope Hicks, and several other close Trump campaign confidants – as well as Nunberg’s presence in Washington on Friday to answer questions before the grand jury.Rather than quietly comply – as is the typical reaction to receiving a federal grand jury’s legally-binding summons – Nunberg leaked the substantive part of his subpoena to the Washington Post and embarking on a whirlwind media tour, proclaiming that he will not cooperate.“I think it would be funny if they arrested me,” Nunberg told MSNBC’s Katy Tur when asked if he feared contempt charges or arrest, adding later, “I think my lawyer’s gonna dump me” and “I’m not gonna go to jail.”“What they sent me was absolutely ridiculous,” Nunberg protested. “Should I spend 50 hours going over all my emails? … I’m not gonna cooperate when they want me to come into a grand jury for them to insinuate that Roger Stone was colluding with [Wikileaks’s] Julian Assange.”“Roger’s like family to me. I’m not gonna do it!” Nunberg continued. “What does Bob Mueller need to see my emails when I send Roger and Steve clips and we talk about how much we hate people.”Tur, meanwhile, repeatedly pressed Nunberg as to why, until he received his own subpoena, he was generally supportive of Mueller’s investigation. He denied anyone had pressured him, claiming he came to this decision only hours earlier.Just minutes after hanging up with Tur, Nunberg called into CNN, where he stayed on the line for successive interviews with Gloria Berger and Jake Tapper.A second MSNBC appearance came Monday night, in which Nunberg talked to Ari Melber about Hope Hicks being his rival Corey Lewandowski’s “paramour.”Nunberg was no less flip in print. “Let him arrest me. Mr. Mueller should understand I am not going in on Friday,” Nunberg told the Washington Post in a similarly unguarded interview, vowing to physically tear the subpoena up live on Bloomberg TV.The reaction across the media was one of near uniform shock at his open defiance. Some feared he was under the influence of alcohol or had become mentally unwell.In a Fox Business recap of the Nunberg saga, Charlie Gasparino claimed that, as an old acquaintance of Nunberg’s, he did not “want to be doing this story right now,” adding later that he did not feel it was his “professional obligation” as a reporter to “blow this guy up.”“When he told me this stuff, that he wanted to go public with it, that he wanted me to break it, I asked him three times whether he was sure and is he of sound mind to do this, because I didn’t think he was,” Gasparino related to Fox Business colleague Liz Claman. “He told me he was drinking. … I just watched him on MSNBC and CNN, and the man needs help.”“If you’re listening Sam, get help. What I just witnessed was a trainwreck and I feel bad for the guy,” Gasparino pleaded.Monday night when Nunberg chose to continue his TV interview marathon with a third CNN appearance with Erin Burnett, she claimed she could smell alcohol on his breath. Nunberg protested that he had not been drinking.Relations between Trump and Nunberg took a steep dive after the latter was fired over a decade-old racial slur on his Facebook page. Eventually, Trump sued Nunberg for millions over alleged campaign leaks.That suit settled “amicably” out of court, but the animosity towards Trump was still clearly evident in Nunberg’s Monday “meltdown.”“I’m not a fan of Donald Trump, as you well know,” he told Tur. “He treated Roger and me very badly, and he screwed us over during the campaign.”“He treated me like crap,” Nunberg echoed to Tapper. “I should not have been fired, Roger should not have been treated the way he was.”Nunberg found the Trump-Russia collusion narrative “the biggest joke” and was generally dismissive of Trump as a meaningful political mind. “Had he not won the primary, he probably would have endorsed Hillary Clinton,” he said to Tur.“I wanted Trump to lose. I didn’t care if he lost. I thought it would be funny,” Nunberg told Melber.“The Russians and Trump did not collude,” Nunberg told the Washington Post, mocking his former boss and saying, “Putin is too smart to collude with Donald Trump.”Later in his interview with Tur, however, he reversed course. “I think they may. I think that he may have done something during the election, but I don’t know for sure.”“Granted, Donald Trump caused this because he’s an idiot, because he decided to give an interview to Lester Holt the day after he fired James Comey and then he decided to have the Russians in the Oval Office,” Nunberg explained to CNN’s Tapper. “Who the hell advised him to allow those Russians in the Oval Office?”According to Nunberg, he has already flatly denied to special counsel’s office investigators both collusion and Trump taking policy positions to benefit his business. He claimed Mueller’s men asked him things like if he heard Russian being spoken at Trump campaign HQ.Others in the Trump administration did not escape Nunberg’s broadly aimed derision. “You know what? If Sarah Huckabee wants to start debasing me, she’s a joke,” he told Tapper of the president’s popular press secretary. “Okay fine yeah, she’s not attractive, she’s a fat slob.”At the conclusion of his media grand tour, Nunberg appeared to issue something of a recantation, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he was “going to end up cooperating” with the investigation.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/free-trade-great-idea-election-loser/","The Club for Growth came out against President Donald Trump’s proposed steel and aluminum tariffs on Monday. That much was expected.What was rather incredible was the Club’s reasoning: it claimed Trump’s tariffs would “help hand the election to the Democrats.”The reality is that free trade is almost a guaranteed election loser (and I say this as a long-standing free trader who is personally opposed to tariffs in most circumstances, including these).Since President Bill Clinton, who signed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) into law in 1994, no candidate has won the presidency on a free trade platform.Al Gore, NAFTA’s most prominent early defender, lost to George W. Bush in 2000. President Bush imposed, then lifted steel tariffs, and went on to win re-election in 2004, defeating Senator John Kerry (D-MA), who had a wishy-washy record on free trade (as on most other issues).Sen. Barack Obama (D-IL) opposed free trade agreements in Congress, and won the presidency in 2008 by running against free trade. His opponent, Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), was in favor of free trade, as was the next Republican nominee, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who also lost to Obama.In his second term, Obama flip-flopped on trade, negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and trying to reach a free trade deal with the EU.Hillary Clinton was also a hypocrite on free trade, though in the opposite direction: The former Secretary of State called the TPP the “gold standard” in trade agreements, then ran against free trade deals under pressure from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the Democratic Party presidential primary in 2016. In the general election, Trump called himself a free trade supporter, but ran against existing agreements and promised to raise tariffs, as he is doing.The problem for free traders is not that their policies are unpopular, but that the benefits of free trade are dispersed across society, while the costs of free trade — in factory closures, for example, which are theoretically temporary — are concentrated. The social scientist Mancur Olson called this the “logic of collective action,” and it was evident in 2016, most notably in the remarkable Michigan Democratic primary, arguably the greatest polling upset of all time.Clinton led Sanders by 21.4% in the RealClearPolitics poll average before Election Day, but Sanders won by 1.5%. Exit polls of Michigan voters showed that majorities of both Democrats (56%) and Republicans (53%) opposed trade by wide margins — even though trade supports over a million jobs in Michigan. Sanders’s anti-trade message resonated with those voters — and many of them may have quietly crossed party lines to vote for Trump in the end.Free trade agreements offer great benefits to society as a whole. But they require citizens to place enormous trust in their government — trust that the risk to vulnerable industries will be offset by new investment, or social insurance.That trust is lacking today, for a variety of reasons — one of which is that our government has not done enough to help those who bore the brunt of previous free trade agreements, while our politicians have largely ignored them.Theoretically, it is possible that consumers might suffer from Trump’s proposed tariffs before Election Day, for two reasons. First, a tariff is a tax, and it will be paid by the same people who are otherwise enjoying Trump’s income tax cut. Second, U.S. firms could be forced to cut jobs, especially in a trade war.But those effects, if they happen, will likely take a while. As much as free traders like me might wish otherwise, protectionism wins at the polls.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

Stating her remarks amounted to “tough love,” the secretary told the chiefs she has seen little evidence of their use of the federal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) to develop education plans that best meet the needs of students.The CCSSO is one of the owners – along with the National Governors Association – of the Common Core State Standards.DeVos said the purpose of ESSA is to “prohibit federal control of education.”The law is the most recent version of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), and one that replaced No Child Left Behind (NCLB). The ESEA was signed into law in 1965 by President Lyndon Johnson as part of his “War on Poverty” program.“Whatever the reasons, I see too many plans that only meet the bare minimum required by the law,” she continued. “Sure, they may pass muster around conference tables in Washington, but the bare minimum won’t pass muster around kitchen tables. And I’m not alone in this view.”DeVos has been a proponent of ESSA, and said the federal law “invites a different approach” that encourages states to use “flexibility” to meet the needs of their students.She chastised school chiefs of states with accountability plans “that were so complicated, schools would be accountable to no one.”“We must do better for parents,” the secretary insisted. “For students. For our country.”“[O]ur children deserve better than the 19th century assembly-line approach,” DeVos added. “Or the “NCLB” approach. Or the ‘RTTT’ [Race to the Top] approach. The ‘Washington knows best’ approach.”“[T[he imperative to do something shouldn’t have to come from Washington,” she said. “It shouldn’t have to come from your state capital. The imperative to do better comes from students. We are accountable to them!”While DeVos asserted ESSA offers states more freedom, the law still requires the federal education department to approve of state education plans and mandates annual testing.Many conservative education policy analysts and grassroots parents, who studied ESSA prior to its enactment, found that the federal law actually imposed the Obama-era Common Core standards on the entire country.Following approval of ESSA, American Principles Project senior fellow Emmett McGroarty wrote at The Pulse 2016, “Anti-Common Core activists tried for months to warn Congress that the new federal education bill … was a disaster that would cement, not overturn, the odious progressive-education philosophies of the Obama Administration.”“Now comes confirmation that the activists were dead on — and that Republican leadership, including Sen. Lamar Alexander, Rep. John Kline, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, carried out a cynical scheme to betray their constituents and give the Administration everything it wanted,” McGroarty continued, citing a Politico Pro interview with former Obama education secretary Arne Duncan.“[I]f you look at the substance of what is there … embedded in the law are the values that we’ve promoted and proposed forever,” Duncan said. “The core of our agenda from Day One, that’s all in there – early childhood, high standards [i.e., Common Core], not turning a blind eye when things are bad. For the first time in our nation’s history, that’s the letter of the law.”According to The Republic, some state school chiefs “pushed back” against DeVos’s “tough love” with complaints about federal education spending cuts:Speaking in the wake of the Florida school shooting that left 17 people dead, Tony Smith, the Illinois state schools superintendent, said the Trump administration was cutting federal funding for education, including school safety.“All of the cuts that are proposed do make it more difficult to do some of the things that people here want more of,” Smith told reporters after he and his colleagues met with DeVos.Kirsten Baesler, the North Dakota education chief, agreed. “It certainly makes our job harder to keep our students safe when our resources are being cut back or eliminated,” she said.However, Kentucky Education Commissioner Stephen Pruitt reportedly noted inconsistency in DeVos’s grading of the state education plans.He said DeVos rejected a proposal from his plan regarding school evaluation, but kept the same one in the plan from Georgia.“There is a lot of inconsistency in how those reports have been done,” Pruitt said. “I had to move it out of mine, get my state board to agree to that, but it got approved in other places.”DeVos also told state school chiefs they needed to have an “open and honest conversation about what went wrong” in Parkland, Florida where a 19-year-old young man with multiple incidents of past aggressive behavior went on a high school shooting rampage that killed 17 people.“No student, no parent, no teacher should ever have to experience what many did at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School,” she said.“We must have an open and honest conversation about what went wrong, and what we must do now to ensure our children are safe at school,” the secretary continued. “I look forward to hearing your ideas and working with you. I know we may sometimes differ on what policy levers to pull, as there is no one-size-fits all approach for every state, or for every community. And there will be varying solutions. I hope we can always stay focused on individual students.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Dick Durbin (D-IL) says that a lack of amnesty for millions of illegal aliens is a “humanitarian crisis,” while black Americans continue to be overly unemployed in his home state of Illinois.In the Senate on Monday, Durbin said President Trump’s end to the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program was a national disaster but did not mention the fact that his state’s unemployment rate for black Americans remains above the national average at nearly ten percent.The end of DACA is a humanitarian crisis in this country created by President Trump on September 5. The lives of Dreamers hang in the balance, and it’s up to Republicans who control Congress to decide what happens next. pic.twitter.com/GlV6AlVQek— Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) March 5, 2018“This humanitarian crisis in this country, and I call it that,” Durbin said. “Was created by President Trump on September 5th.” [Emphasis added]President Trump, in contrast to Durbin, has secured historic wage increases, job opportunities, and record-low unemployment for black Americans through his strict immigration enforcement initiative known as “Buy American, Hire American,” which has weeded many illegal aliens out of the U.S. workforce.The black unemployment sits at 6.8 percent nationwide, the lowest ever in history since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking black unemployment in 1972.In contrast, while Durbin pushes amnesty for illegal aliens, which would legalize more foreigners to compete for working-class jobs against black Americans, the unemployment rate for black Americans in Illinois is ten percent, well above the record-low national average.In February, Trump’s strict immigration enforcement measures secured 600 black Americans higher wages and jobs in Chicago, as Breitbart News reported. The black Americans working at a Chicago bakery called the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency to notify them of all the illegal Mexican workers working at the bakery.Lynne Lane, a worker at the bakery, told the Chicago Sun-Times that the racial makeup of the bakery was once 90 percent Mexican and ten percent black Americans. Now, she says the bakery is made up of 90 percent black American workers.Unlike Durbin, black Americans are some of the most supportive citizens for seriously reducing legal immigration levels, understanding that it would lead to higher wages and less job competition in the U.S. labor market.As Breitbart News reported, when asked, “In your opinion, about how many legal immigrants should be admitted to the U.S. each year,” 48 percent of black Americans said they would like to see between one and 250,000 legal immigrants brought to the U.S. a year.Black Americans have been disproportionately impacted by mass immigration to the U.S., researchers say, as they were replaced by Hispanics in 2004 as the largest minority group in the country.Every year the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/while-daca-illegal-aliens-demand-amnesty-americans-demand-less-immigration/","While illegal aliens, the open borders lobby, and corporate interests are out demanding amnesty for millions of illegal aliens living across the United States, American citizens have repeatedly demanded less illegal and legal immigration to the U.S.Illegal aliens enrolled and eligible for the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program took to the streets on Monday to proclaim that they are entitled to an amnesty that would allow them to remain permanently in the U.S.Meanwhile, Americans in recent polling say they want less overall immigration to the country, not more. Currently, the U.S. admits more than one million legal immigrants every year, the vast majority of which are low-skilled and thus immediately begin competing for jobs against working and middle-class Americans.In the latest Harvard-Harris poll, 60 percent of Americans said they wanted the process known as “chain migration” ended for DACA illegal aliens, preventing the group of nearly 800,000 to 3.5 million illegal aliens from being able to inundate the U.S. with their foreign relatives.Chain migration is the process whereby newly naturalized citizens can currently bring their foreign relatives to the U.S. as legal immigrants. Chain migration has imported about 9.3 million foreign nationals to the U.S. since 2005. In that same time period, a total of 13.06 million foreign nationals have entered the U.S. through the legal immigration system, as every seven out of ten new arrivals come to the country for no other purpose than to reunify with foreign relatives.This makes chain migration the largest driver of immigration to the U.S. — making up more than 70 percent — with every two new immigrants bringing seven foreign relatives with them.Likewise, the Harvard-Harris poll found that an overwhelming majority of Americans support President Trump’s effort to reduce legal immigration by nearly half by ending chain migration and instead implementing a legal immigration system that is selective and chooses immigrants based on their merit, skills, and English proficiency.A majority of 84 percent of Americans said they support a merit-based legal immigration system over the current chain migration process. Swing-voters are some of the most supportive Americans of a merit-based legal immigration system, garnering nearly 90 percent support for the plan from voters who identify as “Independent.”Another 79 percent of Americans polled in the Harvard-Harris survey said they are opposed to open borders and that the U.S. needs “secure borders.” Seventy-one percent of black Americans and 72 percent of Hispanic Americans said they are opposed to open borders, favoring secure borders for the nation.The most revealing component of the poll is a portion that shows widespread support among Americans for Trump’s immigration plan that would cut legal immigration levels in half in exchange for allowing only illegal aliens enrolled in DACA — about 690,000 — to stay in the U.S. The results of the immigration reduction would likely be increased wages for American workers and a tightened labor market that would give more opportunity to young Americans graduating college, black Americans, and the white working class.The immigration reduction plan is supported by 63 percent of Americans, including nearly 60 percent support from swing voters and 57 percent of Americans who identify as liberals.As Breitbart News reported, Republican voters now say that reducing overall immigration to the U.S. is the second-biggest priority for them, marking it as more important than tax reform, destroying ISIS, and even repealing Obamacare.Poll of Republican Voters: Reducing Immigration More Important than Replacing Obamacare, Destroying ISIShttps://t.co/CD9WsH7zVw— John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) February 22, 2018The current big business-preferred, Washington-imposed cheap labor economic model of importing more than one million new legal immigrants every year to compete mostly for working and middle-class jobs against Americans has resulted in decades of stagnant and even decreased wages for U.S. workers:Median earnings of full-time, year-round workers, 15 years and older, 1960 to 2016.For instance, the massive importation of low-skilled foreign nationals to the U.S. has translated to a cheap-labor economy that has aided in keeping American men’s wages stagnant for at least 44 years, as Breitbart News reported. Median earnings for American men working full-time were actually lower in 2016 than they were in 2007.Meanwhile, the economic nationalist model has already resulted in history-making wage growth for American workers in the construction industry, the garment industry, for workers employed at small businesses, and for black Americans.In contrast, the tight labor market economy pursued by the Trump administration via strict immigration enforcement could result in even higher wages for Americans if the system known as “E-Verify” was mandated across the country for all U.S. employers.https://t.co/Ndcyj30XGw— John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) February 18, 2018John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

(Field and Stream is subsidiary of Dick’s.)  Watson’s suit, filed in the Circuit Court of Oregon for the County of Jackson, says a store employee refused the purchase and indicated, “He would not sell [Watson] any firearm, including rifles and shotguns, or ammunition for a firearm, because [Watson] is under 21 years old.”The employee referenced Dick’s recent policy shift, disallowing firearm sales to anyone under 21, and cited the policy as the reason for denying the sale.Watson’s suit alleges that Dick’s policy violates Oregon law against age-based discrimination for people 18 years and older in places of public accommodations. State law includes prohibitions against discrimination in stores that are open to the general public.Watson also filed a separate suit claiming a Walmart store in Josephine County, Oregon, discriminated against him by denying him a rifle sale “on or about March 3, 2018.” As with Dick’s, the Walmart employee at the gun counter allegedly told Watson that rifles and shotguns could not be sold to individuals under the age of 21. The employee indicated that ammunition for firearms could not be sold to anyone under 21 either.In both suits Watson alleges that the defendants, Dick’s and Walmart, not only discriminated but “advertised … unlawful discriminatory policies by issuing a press release, and other materials, stating that [the defendants] will no longer sell any firearms or ammunition to any person under the age of 21.”On February 28, 2018, Breitbart News reported Dick’s Sporting Goods’ announcement that they would no longer sell firearms to anyone under the age of 21.

Since DACA’s inception under Obama, more than 2,100 illegal aliens have been kicked off the program after it was revealed that they were either criminals or gang members.Also, as Breitbart News reported, only four percent of DACA illegal aliens have completed a college education, making the DACA population far less likely than the native American population to finish college with a degree.Another 25 percent of DACA illegal aliens, Breitbart News reported, are “functionally illiterate” in the English language, despite being touted by the open borders lobby as being highly-educated and highly-skilled.Most recently, a DACA illegal alien was arrested in Rochester, New York after allegedly threatening to shoot up a nearby high school, as Breitbart News reported.Likewise, in October 2017, a DACA illegal alien was arrested and charged with murdering a teenage girl in Greenville County, South Carolina. The illegal alien DACA recipient, Daniel De Jesus Rangel Sherrer, allegedly shot 18-year-old Diana Martinez-Gonzalez to death in a wooded area, according to police.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/mississippi-u-s-senator-thad-cochran-to-resign-april-1/","Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS) resigned from office on Monday, effective April 1. He has been in failing health for several months.“Longtime Republican Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told The Associated Press on Monday that he will resign April 1 because of health problems,” the wire service reported from Jackson, Mississippi late Monday afternoon:Cochran, who turned 80 in December, stayed home for a month last fall with urinary tract infections, returning to Washington in October to give Republicans the majority they needed to pass a budget plan.“I regret my health has become an ongoing challenge,” Cochran said in a statement. “I intend to fulfill my responsibilities and commitments to the people of Mississippi and the Senate, through the completion of the 2018 appropriations cycle, after which I will formally retire from the U.S. Senate.”Attention now turns to Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, who under state law has the authority to appoint a temporary replacement to serve in the U.S. Senate until a special election, when Missisippi voters can select a permanent replacement to fill out the remainder of Cochran’s term, which ends in January 2021. The full six year term will be up to the voters of Mississippi in November 2020.November 2018 may be the most likely time for that special election.Mississippi’s other U.S. Senator, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS), is up for re-election to another full six year term in November of this year.Wicker faces Tea Party favorite, conservative State Senator Chris McDaniel in the June 5 Republican primary.McDaniel was defeated by Cochran in a Republican primary runoff in June 2014 by one percent of the vote in a race that Tea Party activists considered to be unfair and stolen.Breitbart has written extensively about Cochran’s failing health in recent months, an issue that was a topic of concern back in the 2014 election.Earlier in 2014, Breitbart reported on Cochran’s “unbelievable skill for having federally funded buildings named after him.”After his first wife died, Cochran married his longtime aide, Kay Webber, in 2015. Earlier, Breitbart News reported that Webber had “accompanied him to 42 countries on 33 taxpayer-funded trips.”Gov. Bryant is likely to come under intense pressure from conservatives and Tea Party activists in Mississippi to appoint McDaniel to the seat many believe was stolen from him in 2014.***Update***For Immediate Release
Date: March 5, 2018Senator Chris McDaniel’s Statement on Senator Thad Cochran’s Retirement“I wish Senator Cochran nothing but the best in his retirement and thank him for his service to Mississippi in the United States Senate.Given Senator Cochran’s retirement, I will continue to monitor developments regarding his replacement and the Special Election that will follow.What is important is that Mississippi now has the unique opportunity to send two conservatives to the US Senate to help President Trump get his ‘Make America Great Again’ agenda passed. If Mississippi won’t send conservatives to the United States Senate, who will?While it is certain that Mississippi will have two US Senate races this year, I am currently focused on my campaign against Roger Wicker, but all options remain on the table as we determine the best way to ensure that Mississippi elects conservatives to the United States Senate.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

In addition, the U.S. mid-term Congressional elections and provincial elections in Canada loom. “All these complicate our work,” he said.The final days of the negotiations were drawn into the orbit of the recent announcement by President Trump that the U.S. would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Canada is the largest exporter of aluminum and steel to the U.S. Nearly 90 percent of Canadian steel production is exported to the U.S. Top trump trade adviser Peter Navarro has said that Canada and Mexico would not be exempted from the tariffs.Representatives from Canada and Mexico have both decried the tariffs. Canada’s top trade official has described the tariff as “unacceptable.”President Trump on Monday appeared to offer a concession on steel and aluminum as an additional incentive to Canada and Mexico to reach a deal on Nafta. Speaking to the press during an Oval Office meeting, Trump said that exceptions to the tariffs could be included in a new NAFTA deal.Lighthizer said that the U.S. may be willing to do separate bilateral agreements with Canada and Mexico if the three-nation talks fail.

He called on Congress to find a solution for the DACA population, many of whom are now adults. The move gave Congress six months to come to a deal and pass legislation on the issue. Trump later issued four pillars that he wanted to see Congress include in a DACA deal and declared he would sign such a bill.Sanders recalled the events for reporters and chastised Congress for failing to act on “legislation and principles that the majority of members of Congress have supported in the past.”“They claim to want to fix DACA. The President laid out a pathway and an exact way to do that. They failed to address it,” she continued, while expressing hope from the White House that Congress will “actually do their jobs, show up, and get something done and fix this problem, not kick it down the road and not continue to ignore it.”DACA challenges continue to move through the court system. Sanders responded to a question as to what happens when the case gets to the Supreme Court: “We fully expect to win on an appeal, and if we need to go to the Supreme Court, we feel very confident there as well, but again, it’s Congress’s job to pass laws.”“The sad part is that both Republicans and Democrats don’t disagree on most of the merits of this legislation,” said Sanders, who then called Congress “pathetic” and accused them of using the court system as an excuse as they have failed to pass legislation.“The fact that they can’t actually come together and get something done is pathetic, and now they’re using the courts as an excuse,” she said. “They need to come to work and actually do what they were elected to do.”As February came to a close, the Supreme Court announced that it would not grant a Department of Justice request to expedite the DACA case, skipping the liberal U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that is dealing with the case now.White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah shot back at the decision, calling the DACA program “clearly unlawful.” He added, “The district judge’s decision to unilaterally re-impose a program that Congress had explicitly and repeatedly rejected is a usurpation of legislative authority.” He then reaffirmed the White House belief that they would ultimately prevail.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/daca-illegal-aliens-wont-get-special-prioritization-as-deadline-for-obamas-amnesty-remains-meaningless/","The nearly 800,0o0 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program will not receive special “prioritization” to have their status renewed, as the original March 5 deadline for the program remains meaningless.In September 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA — which shields young illegal aliens from deportation — would end on March 5. However, since then, a California judge claimed the decision to end DACA violated regulatory procedures because it quickly ended amnesty for the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.Since the ruling, the federal government has now had to renew DACA amnesty for illegal aliens who apply for renewal. This renewing of DACA will continue until the Supreme Court makes its decision in a few months.While DACA illegal aliens can keep renewing their amnesty status, they will not be prioritized, according to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).“There is not a prioritization,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Press Secretary Tyler Houlton told Politico. “USCIS is processing applications as they are submitted.”As DACA illegal aliens can remain in the U.S. for the time being, escaping deportation once again, the pro-mass immigration billionaire GOP megadonors the Koch brothers have started a campaign to demand the Republican-controlled Congress and President Trump sign off on an amnesty for millions of illegal aliens.Spokesperson for the Koch brothers says its crucial to continue inflow of admitting more than one million mostly low-skilled legal immigrants every year: ""We just need to know there’s going to be no reduction to legal immigration."" https://t.co/411hsTDvUk— John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) March 2, 2018The Koch brothers have begun running this six-figure ad campaign for amnesty, in which DACA illegal aliens are described as “patriots” to the U.S.“We love our country, our way of life, and we sacrifice and fight to defend it,” the ad begins, narrated by the voice of a DACA illegal alien. “We work hard, put food on the table, care for our families, and we pledge allegiance to this flag. We are patriots. We are DREAMers. We believe America’s best days are yet to come. And we want to be a part of it.” [Emphasis added]The Koch brothers’ DACA amnesty push comes after the billionaire, avid free trade, low-wage-seeking, open borders defenders announced that they would oppose Trump’s popular pro-American immigration agenda that seeks to reduce legal immigration levels to raise the wages and quality of life of America’s working and middle class.“We just need to know there’s going to be no reduction to legal immigration,” a spokesperson for the Koch brothers said.The Koch brothers and their pro-mass immigration, corporatist views are deeply out-of-line with the American people, especially the country’s working and middle class, who have been hit the hardest by the importation of more than a million low-skilled legal immigrants a year.For example, as Breitbart News reported, Republican voters — even those who did not vote for Trump’s economic nationalist agenda — said they see reducing legal immigration levels as the second biggest priority, more important than destroying the Islamic State (ISIS), repealing Obamacare, and tax reform.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/soaring-american-oil-production-will-push-u-s-close-to-energy-independence/","American oil production will soar over the next five years, supplying much of the world’s growing demand for oil, the International Energy Agency said on Monday.U.S. production of crude oil, condensates, and natural gas liquids will rise to 17 million barrels a day by 2023, up from 13.2 million in 2017, according to IAE’s forecast. As a result, U.S. production will supply around 80 percent of the increased global supply of oil, which the IAE sees rising 6.4 million barrels per day to 107 million barrels a day.Demand for oil will rise by 6.9 million barrels a day to 1.04.7 million, the IEA forecast.The rising U.S. production means the U.S. will become close to being energy self-sufficient, a huge shift from the era not so long ago when the U.S. was the world’s largest oil importer.“The United States is set to put its stamp on global oil markets for the next five years,” Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said in a statement.The projections come from Oil 2018, the IEA’s five-year market analysis and forecast. The chart below shows where the IEA sees future oil production coming from. NGLs is short for Natural Gas Liquids, which is a family hydrocarbons that includes ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, and pentane. LTO, the largest growing segment, is short for Light Tight Oil, industry jargon for shale oil.“Over the next three years, gains from the United States alone will cover 80% of the world’s demand growth, with Canada, Brazil and Norway – all IEA family members – able to cover the rest,” the IAE said.The report notes that despite falling costs, additional investment will be needed to spur supply growth after 2020. That may be aided by recent tax cuts in the U.S., which dramatically lower the rates for corporations and allow for faster deductions for capital expenses.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

In a three-year partnership with the conservationists Lacoste will produce a a new range of polo shirts, each with a logo of a threatened species on it.Lacoste’s website states that “by buying a polo, you participate in helping IUCN and Lacoste in the fight for wildlife conservation worldwide.”In a symbolic gesture, Lacoste will produce just the number of polo shirts that corresponds to the remaining population sizes of the animals believed to be currently in the wild.The new “Save Our Species” line will feature a total of 1,775 polo shirts, with 350 shirts with a logo of the Sumatran Tiger, 67 of the Javan Rhino, 157 of the Kakapo parrot and 40 of the Burmese Roofed Turtle.Proceeds from the $195 shirts will reportedly be donated to the conservation union in an effort to help protect endangered species.The small green crocodile logo was designed in 1927 by the artist Robert Georg, with the original pencil sketch drawn in homage to the tennis champion René Lacoste, the winner of a series of international tournaments.The American press dubbed him the “crocodile,” following a bet with the captain of the French team. If Lacoste won a crucial game for the championship, he would be awarded a crocodile-skin suitcase. And Lacoste won.In 1933 René Lacoste’s clothing company was born, with André Gillier as founding President and a green crocodile embroidered on each shirt.In 2011, Lacoste removed its sponsorship from the Lacoste Elysée Prize, after the prize was awarded to Larissa Sansour for her photographic project “Nation Estate,” depicting a dystopic Palestine.Earlier that same year, Lacoste suffered another PR crisis when the French brand asked Norwegian police to prevent Anders Behring Breivik, a terrorist who killed 77 people in bomb and gun attacks in Norway, from wearing Lacoste clothing in court.Follow Thomas D.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2018/03/05/aipac-chief-opens-annual-conference-promoting-failed-two-state-solution/","Howard Kohr, executive director of the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC, launched his organization’s esteemed conference on Sunday by promoting the largely failed two-state solution.Kohr declared: “We must all work for that, toward that future, two states for two peoples: one Jewish with secure and defensible borders and one Palestinian with its own flag and its own future.”Kohr lamented that “today that dream seems remote. This is tragic. The absence of a constructive peace process is nothing to celebrate. Israel’s security cannot be fully assured and a promise cannot be fully realized until she is at peace with all her neighbors, and peace begins by talking.”Kohr stated: “The rulers of the Middle East are now beginning to see that working with Israel – instead of isolating her – can strengthen their own security and help them meet the needs of their people. These emerging relationships promise to be an example for other nations to follow, a force for moderation, and it is a message to the Palestinian leadership that a bright future is possible when you finally put aside generations of hatred and choose to live side-by-side in peace with the Jewish State of Israel.”Kohr was speaking at the AIPAC Policy Conference in Washington, DC.The so-called two-state solution calls for the creation of a Palestinian state, ostensibly in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and some eastern sections of Jerusalem, in exchange for the Palestinian Authority ending its conflict with Israel and living at peace with the Jewish state.The “two-state solution” has been the defining formula for all Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, and so far every Israeli offer of a state has been rejected by the PA.Israel offered the Palestinians a state with territory in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem at Camp David in 2000, Taba in 2001, the Annapolis Conference in 2007, 2008 and during U.S.-brokered talks in 2013 and 2014. Israel has since been willing to restart talks at any time.According to some reports, Israel went so far as to offer the Palestinians control of the Temple Mount, Judaism’s holiest site, in at least two separate, desperate bids to make peace.In each of these cases, without any exception, the Palestinian Authority rejected Israel’s offer of a state and bolted the negotiations. In most cases, they countered statehood offers with major escalations in violence, including infamously launching the deadly Second Intifada, or terrorist war, in response to the Camp David peace talks.PA President Mahmoud Abbas currently refuses to come to the bargaining table. Besides the PA’s rejection of all previous statehood offers, a major issue blocking the “two-state solution” is that the PA, which would rule a future state, supports terrorism, incites against Israel, celebrates the killers of Jews and pays monthly stipends to those who murder Israelis. Abbas’s security forces have participated in scores of deadly attacks against Israelis. There have been ongoing attempts at reconciliation between Abbas’s Fatah Party and the Hamas terrorist organization.There is no significant evidence to suggest that a Palestinian state run by a Palestinian leadership that openly supports terrorism and has been flirting with a unity deal with Hamas would be moderate or a force against regional radicalism. There is overwhelming evidence to support the charge that a future Palestinian state would encourage terrorism, remain in a permanent state of war with Israel and work to destabilize the region.After years of failed negotiations and Israel’s disastrous evacuation of the Gaza Strip in 2005, which resulted in Hamas’s takeover of that territory, the Israeli public currently overwhelmingly rejects an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, according to numerous recent surveys.There have been attempts within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Likud Party to pass legislation calling for Israeli annexation of the strategic West Bank as an alternative to the “two-state solution.”The West Bank contains historic Jewish communities and some of the holiest sites in Judaism, including the Tomb of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs in Hebron, Rachel’s Tomb in Bethlehem and Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus, or biblical Shechem. The mountainous territory straddles major central Israeli population centers and is a short drive from Israel’s international airport.The Palestinians never had a state in either the West Bank or eastern Jerusalem and they are not legally recognized as the authority in those areas.Meanwhile, some within the Israeli government took issue with AIPAC’s promotion of the two-state solution, including phraseology in the lobby’s website mission statement calling “the promotion of a negotiated two-state solution — a Jewish state of Israel and a demilitarized Palestinian state.”Samaria Regional Council head Yossi Dagan wrote AIPAC to say the website “seems to imply that Israel is committed to a two-state solution and that the United States takes this position as well.”“Please note this assumption has no basis in fact,” he said.“I am astounded as to why such a great, meaningful organization as AIPAC, whose raison d’etre is pro-Israel advocacy in the United States, would represent the positions of the State of Israel (and of the United States) so inaccurately before senior government officials, senators and congressmen, and the general pro-Israel public,” Dagan wrote.“The position that AIPAC is representing as that of the State of Israel — in the AIPAC mission statement and in the AIPAC talking points inter alia — not only fails to represent Israel properly, it is detrimental to the efforts to achieve dialogue in the Middle East,” he added.The Jerusalem Post reported that Land of Israel Caucus co-chairs Likud MK Yoav Kisch and Bayit Yehudi MK Bezalel Smotrich informed AIPAC, “The two state proposal is opposed by the majority of the ministers of the Israeli government, most of the ruling government coalition and most importantly, by the broad spectrum of the citizens of Israel.”“Harsh lessons of the past regarding land concessions have demonstrated that creating the groundwork for a terrorist, fundamentalist, Muslim state in the heart of the Land of Israel is dangerous and lethal to the security of Israel.”Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

What the gangsters at CNN want is to silence the political right, to chill our speech, to remove us from the debate, to end our influence.And so, because CNN is losing in the open arena of ideas as its ratings bottom out, the anti-Trump cable channel has now decided to silence us using the protection racket — to intimidate our advertisers under the guise of journalism.The CNN story noted here is nothing less than extortion.CNN sent out a reporter to ask various companies why their ads are appearing on YouTube videos produced by Alex Jones and InfoWars. In other words, CNN is not only publicly shaming and outing these businesses, CNN is also threatening that this exposure will lead to astro-turfed harassment campaigns and boycotts.But like the smart gangsters they are, CNN also gives these proprietors a way out, a way to buy protection: drop this advertising and CNN will ensure your business is not burned to the ground.Biases up front — I am no Alex Jones fan. He has some talented people on the payroll, but if InfoWars was to go out of business organically, I would not be able to summon a damn. But I am also a free speech extremist who loves living in a country where Alex Jones is part of the public square.I would say, and have said the same, about anyone on the left. As long as you are not condoning or calling for violence, you should be allowed to say whatever you like on social media — this includes lies and conspiracy theories, because the idea of handing someone the power to decide what is and is not a lie or conspiracy theory is much more frightening than lies and conspiracy theories.There are many forms of free expression that I find toxic. But what is far worse than toxic freedom is oppression, what is far more immoral than toxic speech is silencing that speech.The only thing that should be used to fight free speech is more free speech, and those of us who do not want to hear that speech, or who feel harassed in some way, are all blessed with a block button.YouTube is part of our public square, as are Facebook and Twitter. And if you are banned from any of these speech platforms, you are no longer part of the public debate. Rather, you are in a dark room speaking to no one.This is why the social media crackdown against right-of-center speech is so alarming. After capturing the ways in which Americans communicate with one another, these tech oligarchs are now threatening to exclude us from their platforms if we do not behave, speak, and believe, in the appropriate ways.Like many, I believe a private company should be allowed to run its business however it likes. Social media, however, is different. Imagine if 50 years ago a private company purchased the U.S. mail and the telephone company — now imagine if they monitored and censored our communications based on their partisan speech codes. How is that any different from what corporate fascists in Silicon Valley are up to right now?And now, as a means to silence opinions the establishment doesn’t like, CNN is acting as the muscle, the enforcer, the thugs, the gangsters for these tech oligarchs … Running around and openly intimidating businesses; threatening them with extinction, and by extension, making an example of them to others.Today it is Alex Jones.Tomorrow it is Breitbart News.Wednesday it is you. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Hutchinson said that the work requirement is “not about punishing anyone.”“It’s about giving people the opportunity to work. It’s to give them training that they need. It’s to help them move out of poverty and up the economic ladder,” Hutchinson added.The governor was joined by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma.The Medicaid work requirements would only apply to able-bodied, working-age adults. Americans with disabilities, older Americans, children, and pregnant women would not have to comply with potential Medicaid work stipulations.Hutchinson also revealed that the waiver from the CMS does not include a reduction of “Medicaid coverage down to 100 percent of the federal poverty level.”“The administrator has agreed to continue to work with us on that, but we did not want to wait for a full analysis of the entire waiver,” Hutchinson explained.Gov. Hutchinson argued that his waiver would save roughly $365 million in the fiscal year 2019.President Donald Trump’s administration issued a guidance in January allowing states to apply for waivers to reform their state Medicaid programs.Verma, who worked with then-Indiana Gov. Mike Pence to reform that state’s Medicaid program, said, “This gives us a pathway to start approving waivers. This is about helping those individuals rise out of poverty.”Kentucky became the first state to implement work requirements for Medicaid after the CMS approved its waiver in January. Indiana became the second state to implement its work requirements for Medicaid in February.A Rassmussen poll in January found that 64 percent of Americans approve of work requirements for Medicaid.Wisconsin Gov.

As secretary of state, Clinton chose to use a private, non-secure server for government business.”Outside of the obvious security implications, another reason this is important comes down to the statement disgraced former-FBI Director James Comey made when he went out of his way to let Clinton off the hook during the 2016 presidential campaign.In July of 2016, Comey reassured us that, “With respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors, we did not find direct evidence that Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail domain, in its various configurations since 2009, was successfully hacked.” (emphasis added)But, as we now know, between May and June, Comey’s statement was also edited from a hack of Clinton’s server being “reasonably likely” to merely “possible.”“Given that combination of factors, we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to Secretary Clinton’s personal e-mail account,” he said before clearing her of any legal wrongdoing.We also know that Strzok was responsible for the language in this statement that was downgraded from “grossly negligent” (a criminal offense) to “extremely careless.”If these Fox’s sources are correct — and an Inspector General’s report on the FBI’s handling of its investigation into Clinton’s server is expected to tell us soon either way — outside of Strzok’s possible malfeasance, what did Comey know when he assured us there was no “direct evidence” of a hack?

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/05/the-full-nunberg-ex-trump-aide-defies-mueller-in-media-tirade/#disqus_thread","Former Trump aide Sam Nunberg had a full day of media availability Monday after a grand jury working under Special Counsel Robert Mueller subpoened him.Nunberg gave a series of interviews claiming he would refuse to cooperate – leaving some, like FOX Business’s Charlie Gasparino, asking if he was “of sound mind.”The Washington, DC, grand jury empaneled by Mueller sent Nunberg, one of President Donald Trump’s earliest enlisted – and earliest dismissed – campaign aides, a detailed subpoena over the weekend.It requested his complete communications with the president himself, ex-Breitbart News Executive Chairman and Trump campaign CEO Stephen K. Bannon, one-time campaign chairman Corey Lewandowski, Roger Stone, Carter Page, recently resigned White House Communications director Hope Hicks, and several other close Trump campaign confidants – as well as Nunberg’s presence in Washington on Friday to answer questions before the grand jury.Rather than quietly comply – as is the typical reaction to receiving a federal grand jury’s legally-binding summons – Nunberg leaked the substantive part of his subpoena to the Washington Post and embarking on a whirlwind media tour, proclaiming that he will not cooperate.“I think it would be funny if they arrested me,” Nunberg told MSNBC’s Katy Tur when asked if he feared contempt charges or arrest, adding later, “I think my lawyer’s gonna dump me” and “I’m not gonna go to jail.”“What they sent me was absolutely ridiculous,” Nunberg protested. “Should I spend 50 hours going over all my emails? … I’m not gonna cooperate when they want me to come into a grand jury for them to insinuate that Roger Stone was colluding with [Wikileaks’s] Julian Assange.”“Roger’s like family to me. I’m not gonna do it!” Nunberg continued. “What does Bob Mueller need to see my emails when I send Roger and Steve clips and we talk about how much we hate people.”Tur, meanwhile, repeatedly pressed Nunberg as to why, until he received his own subpoena, he was generally supportive of Mueller’s investigation. He denied anyone had pressured him, claiming he came to this decision only hours earlier.Just minutes after hanging up with Tur, Nunberg called into CNN, where he stayed on the line for successive interviews with Gloria Berger and Jake Tapper.A second MSNBC appearance came Monday night, in which Nunberg talked to Ari Melber about Hope Hicks being his rival Corey Lewandowski’s “paramour.”Nunberg was no less flip in print. “Let him arrest me. Mr. Mueller should understand I am not going in on Friday,” Nunberg told the Washington Post in a similarly unguarded interview, vowing to physically tear the subpoena up live on Bloomberg TV.The reaction across the media was one of near uniform shock at his open defiance. Some feared he was under the influence of alcohol or had become mentally unwell.In a Fox Business recap of the Nunberg saga, Charlie Gasparino claimed that, as an old acquaintance of Nunberg’s, he did not “want to be doing this story right now,” adding later that he did not feel it was his “professional obligation” as a reporter to “blow this guy up.”“When he told me this stuff, that he wanted to go public with it, that he wanted me to break it, I asked him three times whether he was sure and is he of sound mind to do this, because I didn’t think he was,” Gasparino related to Fox Business colleague Liz Claman. “He told me he was drinking. … I just watched him on MSNBC and CNN, and the man needs help.”“If you’re listening Sam, get help. What I just witnessed was a trainwreck and I feel bad for the guy,” Gasparino pleaded.Monday night when Nunberg chose to continue his TV interview marathon with a third CNN appearance with Erin Burnett, she claimed she could smell alcohol on his breath. Nunberg protested that he had not been drinking.Relations between Trump and Nunberg took a steep dive after the latter was fired over a decade-old racial slur on his Facebook page. Eventually, Trump sued Nunberg for millions over alleged campaign leaks.That suit settled “amicably” out of court, but the animosity towards Trump was still clearly evident in Nunberg’s Monday “meltdown.”“I’m not a fan of Donald Trump, as you well know,” he told Tur. “He treated Roger and me very badly, and he screwed us over during the campaign.”“He treated me like crap,” Nunberg echoed to Tapper. “I should not have been fired, Roger should not have been treated the way he was.”Nunberg found the Trump-Russia collusion narrative “the biggest joke” and was generally dismissive of Trump as a meaningful political mind. “Had he not won the primary, he probably would have endorsed Hillary Clinton,” he said to Tur.“I wanted Trump to lose. I didn’t care if he lost. I thought it would be funny,” Nunberg told Melber.“The Russians and Trump did not collude,” Nunberg told the Washington Post, mocking his former boss and saying, “Putin is too smart to collude with Donald Trump.”Later in his interview with Tur, however, he reversed course. “I think they may. I think that he may have done something during the election, but I don’t know for sure.”“Granted, Donald Trump caused this because he’s an idiot, because he decided to give an interview to Lester Holt the day after he fired James Comey and then he decided to have the Russians in the Oval Office,” Nunberg explained to CNN’s Tapper. “Who the hell advised him to allow those Russians in the Oval Office?”According to Nunberg, he has already flatly denied to special counsel’s office investigators both collusion and Trump taking policy positions to benefit his business. He claimed Mueller’s men asked him things like if he heard Russian being spoken at Trump campaign HQ.Others in the Trump administration did not escape Nunberg’s broadly aimed derision. “You know what? If Sarah Huckabee wants to start debasing me, she’s a joke,” he told Tapper of the president’s popular press secretary. “Okay fine yeah, she’s not attractive, she’s a fat slob.”At the conclusion of his media grand tour, Nunberg appeared to issue something of a recantation, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he was “going to end up cooperating” with the investigation.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

You all have blood on your hands.— Chelsea Handler (@chelseahandler) February 14, 2018CNN’s February 21 gun control town hall highlighted the media’s animosity towards the NRA, as it featured survivors from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting confronting Republicans over NRA affiliation. The Guardian reported that one student spoke to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), asking, “Can you tell me right now you will not accept a single donation from the NRA?”In addition, more than a dozen companies severed ties with the NRA in the wake of the school attack, ending discounted rates and fares for NRA members.But a large swath of the American populace is equating these various attacks on the NRA with attacks on the Second Amendment, and others see the attacks as proof of “media bias.” The result is an explosion in NRA memberships.The Daily Mail quoted Cleta Mitchell, a former NRA board member and former Oklahoma lawmaker, who said, “There is no one. NO ONE. Who joins the NRA for a discount on a rental car. You can rest assured that the NRA will not lose a single member as a result of this. If anything, it should spur people to join the NRA as a means of demonstrating that we who believe in the Second Amendment will not be bullied by these left wing multi-billion dollar corporations.”AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

(Field and Stream is subsidiary of Dick’s.)  Watson’s suit, filed in the Circuit Court of Oregon for the County of Jackson, says a store employee refused the purchase and indicated, “He would not sell [Watson] any firearm, including rifles and shotguns, or ammunition for a firearm, because [Watson] is under 21 years old.”The employee referenced Dick’s recent policy shift, disallowing firearm sales to anyone under 21, and cited the policy as the reason for denying the sale.Watson’s suit alleges that Dick’s policy violates Oregon law against age-based discrimination for people 18 years and older in places of public accommodations. State law includes prohibitions against discrimination in stores that are open to the general public.Watson also filed a separate suit claiming a Walmart store in Josephine County, Oregon, discriminated against him by denying him a rifle sale “on or about March 3, 2018.” As with Dick’s, the Walmart employee at the gun counter allegedly told Watson that rifles and shotguns could not be sold to individuals under the age of 21. The employee indicated that ammunition for firearms could not be sold to anyone under 21 either.In both suits Watson alleges that the defendants, Dick’s and Walmart, not only discriminated but “advertised … unlawful discriminatory policies by issuing a press release, and other materials, stating that [the defendants] will no longer sell any firearms or ammunition to any person under the age of 21.”On February 28, 2018, Breitbart News reported Dick’s Sporting Goods’ announcement that they would no longer sell firearms to anyone under the age of 21.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/trump-china-trade-measures.html","WASHINGTON — The dust has yet to settle on President Trump’s decision to impose sweeping tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, but the White House is preparing another major trade measure, this time aimed squarely at China.Mr. Trump and his top trade advisers are readying a raft of actions to penalize China’s theft of American intellectual property, including tariffs on at least $30 billion of annual Chinese imports, people familiar with the discussions said.The measures, which could be announced as early as next week, may also include investment restrictions, caps on visas for Chinese researchers and challenges to China’s trade practices at the World Trade Organization. Those familiar with the planning cautioned that the timing could be delayed, and that such measures are likely to be introduced in stages.The rapid pace of White House trade measures is no accident and comes at the president’s request. At a White House meeting last week, Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, presented Mr. Trump with a plan to target $30 billion a year in Chinese imports.That amount is equal to the cost that Mr. Lighthizer’s office estimates Chinese policies aimed at acquiring American technology impose on American companies annually. In August, Mr. Lighthizer officially began an investigation into those practices, which include digital warfare as well as requiring companies to hand over trade secrets and form joint ventures with Chinese partners to gain access to certain markets.Mr. Trump — surrounded by his commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, his trade adviser Peter Navarro and others — asked for a figure beyond $30 billion and for the plan to be officially announced in the coming weeks, according to two people familiar with the exchange.The administration is devising the measure to broadly counter a Chinese strategy known as the Made in China 2025 plan. China introduced a comprehensive initiative in 2015 to upgrade Chinese industry over the next decade and dominate sectors of the future, including advanced information technology, new energy vehicles and aerospace equipment.Unlike the steel and aluminum measure, which divided the president’s advisers and his own party, the idea of targeting China has broad support among a number of officials who believe China is cheating in global trade.Gary D. Cohn, a top economic adviser who resigned over the steel and aluminum tariffs, had approved of action against China, the people familiar with the discussions said. Orrin G. Hatch, the chairman of the powerful Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Republicans who criticized those tariffs, have also endorsed a tough approach toward China.Congress is also weighing legislation that would strengthen national security checks on Chinese investment. In a House hearing on Thursday, Heath P. Tarbert, an assistant secretary of the Treasury Department, said the current system for assessing investment is riddled with loopholes that allowed Chinese companies to evade such checks.Concern over China’s practices picked up speed at the end of the Obama administration and has only increased since. Last year, a technology-focused unit in the Defense Department issued a report arguing that rising Chinese investment in Silicon Valley was giving China unprecedented access to the military technologies of the future, and increasing Chinese ownership of supply chains that service the United States military.In recent months, China’s political apparatus has exerted even greater control over the nation’s economy. Business leaders and politicians of both parties now widely say that Washington’s past strategy of offering Beijing economic incentives to liberalize its market has failed. On Sunday, China officially ended term limits on the presidency, clearing the way for President Xi Jinping to stay in power indefinitely.Administration officials say that past failure to rein in China warrants a much tougher approach. Mr. Trump took one step toward this in his national security strategy, which identified China as an economic aggressor. When a top Chinese economic envoy visited in late February, the administration asked China to shave $100 billion off its $375.2 billion trade surplus with the United States, two people close to the talks said. And while the steel and aluminum tariffs will hit many countries, they are primarily aimed at combating overcapacity in Chinese metals, including those that are routed through other nations.The next step, advisers say, is to more aggressively focus on trade with China.The United States is expected to impose tariffs on Chinese imports of high-technology goods specified in the Made in China 2025 plan, including semiconductors and new energy vehicles. But they could go beyond that to target more mundane products, including consumer electronics, apparel and even shoes. The breadth of the tariffs remains a contentious topic in the business sector and the White House, with some industries fretting about retaliation and increased costs to American companies and consumers.Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday that while the administration was right to focus on China’s unfair trade practices, his group strongly disagreed with sweeping tariffs.“Simply put, tariffs are damaging taxes on American consumers,” he said. “Tariffs of $30 billion a year would wipe out over a third of the savings American families received from the doubling of the standard deduction in tax reform.”Hun Quach, the vice president for international trade at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said that tariffs on apparel, shoes and electronics would hit American families most. “Is the best response to make American consumers pay for China’s violations? We don’t think so,” she said.Although there is wide support for taking action against unfair trade practices by China, business groups and economists still say the measure could be risky. The United States and China maintain the world’s largest trading relationship, and the tariffs could easily provoke a backlash.“They know our system inside out,” said Jim McGregor, the chairman of the greater China region for APCO Worldwide. He added, referring to the House speaker and the Senate majority leader: “They know what companies are important to Paul Ryan. They know what companies are important to Mitch McConnell. They know which trade associations and political groups have a big voice in Washington.”Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while China deserved a tough response, he feared the consequences of the administration’s actions had not been well considered. “You really have to be smart,” he said. “The Chinese aren’t just going to fold over on this.”Mr. Kennedy compared China to a bully that had stolen America’s lunch money. ""You want to teach them a lesson,” he said. “But it’s not as simple as going up in the playground and punching them on the nose.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/russia-cyberattacks.html","The Trump administration accused Russia on Thursday of engineering a series of cyberattacks that targeted American and European nuclear power plants and water and electric systems, and could have sabotaged or shut power plants off at will.United States officials and private security firms saw the attacks as a signal by Moscow that it could disrupt the West’s critical facilities in the event of a conflict.They said the strikes accelerated in late 2015, at the same time the Russian interference in the American election was underway. The attackers had compromised some operators in North America and Europe by spring 2017, after President Trump was inaugurated.In the following months, according to a  Department of Homeland Security report issued on Thursday, Russian hackers made their way to machines with access to critical control systems at power plants that were not identified. The hackers never went so far as to sabotage or shut down the computer systems that guide the operations of the plants.Still, new computer screenshots released by the Department of Homeland Security on Thursday made clear that Russian state hackers had the foothold they would have needed to manipulate or shut down power plants.“We now have evidence they’re sitting on the machines, connected to industrial control infrastructure, that allow them to effectively turn the power off or effect sabotage,” said Eric Chien, a security technology director at Symantec, a digital security firm.“From what we can see, they were there. They have the ability to shut the power off. All that’s missing is some political motivation,” Mr. Chien said.American intelligence agencies were aware of the attacks for the past year and a half, and the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. first issued urgent warnings to utility companies in June. On Thursday, both agencies offered new details as the Trump administration imposed sanctions against Russian individuals and organizations it accused of election meddling and “malicious cyberattacks.”It was the first time the administration officially named Russia as the perpetrator of the assaults. And it marked the third time in recent months that the White House, departing from its usual reluctance to publicly reveal intelligence, blamed foreign government forces for attacks on infrastructure in the United States.In December, the White House said North Korea had carried out the so-called WannaCry attack that in May paralyzed the British health system and placed ransomware in computers in schools, businesses and homes across the world. Last month, it accused Russia of being behind the NotPetya attack against Ukraine last June, the largest in a series of cyberattacks on Ukraine to date, paralyzing the country’s government agencies and financial systems.But the penalties have been light. So far, Mr. Trump has said little to nothing about the Russian role in those attacks.The groups that conducted the energy attacks, which are linked to Russian intelligence agencies, appear to be different from the two hacking groups that were involved in the election interference.That would suggest that at least three separate Russian cyberoperations were underway simultaneously. One focused on stealing documents from the Democratic National Committee and other political groups. Another, by a St. Petersburg “troll farm” known as the Internet Research Agency, used social media to sow discord and division. A third effort sought to burrow into the infrastructure of American and European nations.For years, American intelligence officials tracked a number of Russian state-sponsored hacking units as they successfully penetrated the computer networks of critical infrastructure operators across North America and Europe, including in Ukraine.Some of the units worked inside Russia’s Federal Security Service, the K.G.B. successor known by its Russian acronym, F.S.B.; others were embedded in the Russian military intelligence agency, known as the G.R.U. Still others were made up of Russian contractors working at the behest of Moscow.Russian cyberattacks surged last year, starting three months after Mr. Trump took office.American officials and private cybersecurity experts uncovered a series of Russian attacks aimed at the energy, water and aviation sectors and critical manufacturing, including nuclear plants, in the United States and Europe. In its urgent report in June, the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. notified operators about the attacks but stopped short of identifying Russia as the culprit.By then, Russian spies had compromised the business networks of several American energy, water and nuclear plants, mapping out their corporate structures and computer networks.They included that of the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corporation, which runs a nuclear plant near Burlington, Kan. But in that case, and those of other nuclear operators, Russian hackers had not leapt from the company’s business networks into the nuclear plant controls.Forensic analysis suggested that Russian spies were looking for inroads — although it was not clear whether the goal was to conduct espionage or sabotage, or to trigger an explosion of some kind.In a report made public in October, Symantec noted that a Russian hacking unit “appears to be interested in both learning how energy facilities operate and also gaining access to operational systems themselves, to the extent that the group now potentially has the ability to sabotage or gain control of these systems should it decide to do so.”The United States sometimes does the same thing. It bored deeply into Iran’s infrastructure before the 2015 nuclear accord, placing digital “implants” in systems that would enable it to bring down power grids, command-and-control systems and other infrastructure in case a conflict broke out. The operation was code-named “Nitro Zeus,” and its revelation made clear that getting into the critical infrastructure of adversaries is now a standard element of preparing for possible conflict.The Russians have gone farther.In an updated warning to utility companies on Thursday, Homeland Security officials included a screenshot taken by Russian operatives that proved they could now gain access to their victims’ critical controls.American officials and security firms, including Symantec and CrowdStrike, believe that Russian attacks on the Ukrainian power grid in 2015 and 2016 that left more than 200,000 citizens there in the dark are an ominous sign of what the Russian cyberstrikes may portend in the United States and Europe in the event of escalating hostilities.Private security firms have tracked the Russian government assaults on Western power and energy operators — conducted alternately by groups under the names DragonFly, Energetic Bear and Berserk Bear — since 2011, when they first started targeting defense and aviation companies in the United States and Canada.By 2013, researchers had tied the Russian hackers to hundreds of attacks on energy grid and oil and gas pipeline operators in the United States and Europe. Initially, the strikes appeared to be motivated by industrial espionage — a natural conclusion at the time, researchers said, given the importance of Russia’s oil and gas industry.But by December 2015, the Russian hacks had taken an aggressive turn. The attacks were no longer aimed at intelligence gathering, but at potentially sabotaging or shutting down plant operations.At Symantec, researchers discovered that Russian hackers had begun taking screenshots of the machinery used in energy and nuclear plants, and stealing detailed descriptions of how they operated — suggesting they were conducting reconnaissance for a future attack.As the American government enacted the sanctions on Thursday, cybersecurity experts were still questioning where the Russian attacks could lead, given that the United States was sure to respond in kind.“Russia certainly has the technical capability to do damage, as it demonstrated in the Ukraine,” said Eric Cornelius, a cybersecurity expert at Cylance, a private security firm, who previously assessed critical infrastructure threats for the Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration.“It is unclear what their perceived benefit would be from causing damage on U.S. soil, especially given the retaliation it would provoke,” Mr. Cornelius said.Though a major step toward deterrence, publicly naming countries accused of cyberattacks still is unlikely to shame them into stopping. The United States is struggling to come up with proportionate responses to the wide variety of cyberespionage, vandalism and outright attacks.Lt. Gen. Paul Nakasone, who has been nominated as director of the National Security Agency and commander of United States Cyber Command, the military’s cyberunit, said during his Senate confirmation hearing this month that countries attacking the United States so far have little to worry about.“I would say right now they do not think much will happen to them,” General Nakasone said. He later added, “They don’t fear us.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/trump-white-house-turnover.html","WASHINGTON — In his first full cabinet meeting last June, President Trump invited a chorus of gushing praise from his top aides by boasting that he had assembled a “phenomenal team of people, a great group of talent.”But in the nine months since then, Mr. Trump has fired or forced out a half-dozen of the “incredible, talented” people in the Cabinet Room that day: his secretaries of state and health, along with his chief strategist, his chief of staff, his top economic aide and his press secretary.And the purge at the top may not be over. Mr. Trump, who is famously fickle, appears to have soured on additional members of his senior leadership team — and his frequent mulling about making changes has some people around him convinced that he could act soon.“There will always be change. I think you want to see change,” Mr. Trump said, ominously, on Thursday. “I want to also see different ideas.”John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, met early Friday morning with Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, according to one official briefed on the meeting, amid speculation that Mr. Carson would be pushed out of the cabinet because of the bad publicity he received for the purchase of $31,000 in furniture for his office.Mr. Trump is also facing new reports that he plans to replace Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser. Three people close to Mr. Trump said that he has concluded that he should remove General McMaster, but he has not disclosed when he will do it and who he will appoint as Mr. McMaster’s successor.General McMaster has often been at odds with Mr. Trump on policy. But unlike last year, when General McMaster tried to conform to please the president, he is now ready to leave and is merely waiting for Mr. Trump to ask, two people familiar with the adviser’s thinking said.Among those strongly pushing for him to go is Mr. Kelly, according to four officials familiar with West Wing staffing discussions. Mr. Kelly, who is a former four-star Marine general, also feuded frequently with General McMaster.The four officials said that Mr. Kelly had become increasingly angry at what he viewed as General McMaster’s prolonged effort to undermine Rex W. Tillerson, whom Mr. Trump fired  as secretary of state this week.Mr. Kelly repeatedly staved off efforts to get rid of Mr. Tillerson. After Mr. Tillerson was ousted, Mr. Kelly loudly criticized the decision to colleagues and accelerated his efforts to remove General McMaster, the officials said, adding that Mr. Kelly appeared more eager to act swiftly than the president.One person close to the president said General McMaster, whom officials have described as never having clicked with the president personally, could be replaced as early as Friday.But Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, denied late Thursday a report in The Washington Post that Mr. Trump had already decided to fire General McMaster.“Just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster — contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC,” she wrote on Twitter.If General McMaster does depart the White House, the name most often mentioned as a replacement has been John R. Bolton, a hawkish former ambassador to the United Nations whom Mr. Trump likes seeing on television.But another option is Keith Kellogg, a retired Army lieutenant general who is currently the chief of staff at the National Security Council, according to two people briefed on the discussions. Mr. Kellogg is a favorite of Mr. Trump’s from the 2016 campaign, but there has been resistance to him among White House staff, those briefed on the discussions said.Mr. Kelly himself is also on thin ice, according to officials in the White House. He is said to have angered the president by privately saying “no” to the boss too often.Mr. Trump grew frustrated with Mr. Kelly, in part for stalling on the president’s desire for tariffs. The president finally forced the issue a few weeks ago, announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum, which prompted Gary D. Cohn, his top economic adviser, who had opposed the policy, to announce his resignation.In recent days, Mr. Kelly has sought to repair his standing with the president by moving more aggressively to address issues that have festered, including staffing concerns at the White House and cabinet secretaries with political liabilities.Several high-level people in the administration are at risk.Mr. Carson and David J. Shulkin, the secretary of veterans affairs, have both embarrassed the president by generating scandalous headlines. Mr. Carson could be cut over an eye-popping $31,000 dining set, and Mr. Shulkin might be replaced over a 10-day, $122,000 European trip with his wife.And then there is Attorney General Jeff Sessions, whose original sin — the decision to recuse himself from oversight of the Russia investigation — made him the regular target of presidential ire. The attorney general has threatened to resign at least once, but has more recently indicated his determination to resist Mr. Trump’s obvious desire for him to leave his post at the Justice Department.Mr. Trump could act as early as Friday to remove one or more of them, though the president is known to enjoy keeping people off kilter.In his remarks on Thursday, Mr. Trump assailed predictions of further staff shake-ups by saying such reports were “a very exaggerated and false story.” But he hinted that his choices for a cabinet might have been different had he known then what he knows now.“I’ve gotten to know a lot of people over the last year,” Mr. Trump said.Whether that means the president is about to exercise his option to find new people for his White House is unclear.Mr. Trump has a long habit of musing about staff changes that he does not enact. He does his own version of poll-testing different possibilities, asking aides what they think of one another and asking outside friends and top advisers whether different people would be better in specific jobs, but he often drops the topic without acting.That was certainly the case with Mr. Tillerson, whom he needled for months before finally firing him in a tweet on Tuesday. It has also been true of Mr. Sessions, who has had to endure a series of Twitter attacks from the president, each of which prompts new reports about whether Mr. Trump is about to dump his top law enforcement official.“It’s devastating,” said William M. Daley, who served as former President Barack Obama’s chief of staff for about a year. “No business could handle this, much less the government. It’s supposed to be about stability and continuity. That’s just not in his lexicon.”Just last month, Mr. Trump lamented that Mr. Sessions had failed to investigate the Obama administration’s handling of Russian election meddling, and later called it “DISGRACEFUL!” that Mr. Sessions was not investigating surveillance abuse.“How Trump’s Saturday Night Massacre Might Start With Jeff Sessions,” blared a headline this month in New York magazine. Some White House officials believe that Scott Pruitt, an ambitious lawyer who is the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, is behind rumors that he is in line to replace Mr. Sessions.And yet, Mr. Sessions remains in his job, at least for now. Some associates speculate that Mr. Trump realizes that firing his attorney general would cross a red line for many in his own party, including Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader.“When the shoe drops on Sessions or Kelly, no one is going to be surprised,” Mr. Daley said. “But the long goodbye totally deflates their ability to be effective.”At times, when Mr. Trump is focused on a specific person, he has taken action — hiring Mr. Kelly to replace Reince Priebus, for instance, or empowering Mr. Kelly to expedite the departure of Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s onetime chief strategist.Recently, people close to Mr. Trump say that he has begun to feel more confident that he understands the job of president. He is relying more on his own instincts, putting a premium on his personal chemistry with people and their willingness to acknowledge that his positions are ultimately administration policy, rather than on their résumé or qualifications for the job.That could explain the president’s decision to replace Mr. Tillerson and his choice of successor for Mr. Cohn. If people are unwilling to do what he wants, one adviser said, Mr. Trump now believes that he can get things done himself.Right now, Mr. Trump is surrounded by cabinet officials and a chief of staff who either have caused him negative headlines, such as Mr. Carson and Mr. Shulkin, or have declined to do what he wants, such as Mr. McMaster, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Sessions.Contrary to the notion that Mr. Trump is surrounded by sycophants, the president has aides who are willing to say “no.” But he has increasingly grown frustrated when they do.Mr. Trump also grew frustrated last year with Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, for refusing to enact a ban on transgender members of the military. Mr. Mattis essentially ignored Mr. Trump for several weeks, White House officials said, until the president finally went around him and tweeted it. But Mr. Mattis appears to be safe, even when he ignores the president, in part because he is a general who in Mr. Trump’s mind “looks the part” of a military leader.Mr. Kelly has not fared as well.A few weeks ago, when the scandal surrounding Rob Porter, the staff secretary, exploded into view, Mr. Trump began working the phones to old friends, telling them that he needed his former advisers back and complaining that he was surrounded by people he did not know. He told them that Mr. Kelly had badly botched the Porter issue. (His language was saltier and unfit for publication, according to several people with knowledge of the calls.)This week, he was not in the loop for some of Mr. Trump’s decisions, people briefed on the discussions said, including that he was not immediately aware that Mr. Trump was seriously considering Larry Kudlow for the director of the National Economic Council.Since the Porter scandal, the president has mulled over a number of potential replacements for Mr. Kelly, but he has kept his own counsel about his plans, according to several people close to him.In remarks on Tuesday at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, Mr. Trump praised Mr. Kelly, calling him a “four star” general who is “doing a great job in Washington.”But in a bit of potential foreshadowing, the president also told the Marines in the audience: “I think he likes what you do better than what he does, but he’s doing a great job. He misses you.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/tillerson-pompeo-secretary-state.html","President Trump fired his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, with a tweet this week.Experts, and news reports, have emphasized the unusual nature of Mr. Trump’s relationship with a secretary who reportedly called him a moron — and never denied it.But Mr. Tillerson’s difficulties during his unusually short term also illustrate how the job has changed in recent years. We spoke to several experts and looked at past coverage to explore here how the role was transformed after World War II.The most powerful role in the cabinet?The secretary of state, fourth in line to the presidency, was once considered the most powerful cabinet post. With four exceptions, they have always been white men, starting with Thomas Jefferson, the first to hold the position, in 1790.Many others would go on to be president including James Madison (the fifth), James Monroe (the seventh) and Martin Van Buren (the 10th). Others, like Edmund Muskie, William H. Seward and William Jennings Bryan, aspired to the top job but never won the presidency. And still others are names that might register only with a historian or a trivia buff, like Philander Chase Knox (1909-1913) or Edward Reilly Stettinus (1944-1945).Much of the modern history of the role has been defined by America’s struggle with the Soviet Union. In the years after World War II, various secretaries of state, including George C. Marshall, Dean Acheson and John Foster Dulles, were instrumental in dictating the nation’s foreign policy as the Cold War began to take shape.That struggle also included smaller regional conflicts, most notably in Vietnam, where Dean Rusk, John F. Kennedy’s secretary of state, was initially reluctant to intervene. He was eventually moved to defend the United States’ interference in the country’s affairs.For many, the swashbuckling realpolitik image of the role was fashioned by Henry Kissinger, the German-born diplomat who as secretary of state to Richard Nixon steered the United States toward rapprochement with China.But experts we spoke to were conflicted about whether Mr. Kissinger deserved that credit. He was acknowledged as being seen as a top foreign policy mind, but some argued that he had helped to destroy domestic good will toward American foreign policy during his time in the office. (He is also held in low regard by many on the left, who accuse of him of being a war criminal.)George P. Shultz and the Soviet UnionThe experts we interviewed instead selected George P. Shultz, Ronald Reagan’s longest-serving secretary of state, as perhaps the most effective of the Cold War secretaries.Steve Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview this week that Mr. Shultz was the last secretary of state to really dominate U.S. foreign policy, managing an ever-shifting relationship with the Soviet Union while also tending to policy in East Asia, Latin America and southern Africa.“Shultz was secretary of state for six and a half years and the difference showed,” Mr. Sestanovich said. “He had an authority and a kind of impact on issues that’s much harder to have in the short term.”When the Soviet Union struck a belligerent pose in the early 1980s, Mr. Shultz worked to keep Western European countries unified against the threat. Later in the decade, he succeeded in bringing about perhaps his greatest achievement, the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a pact signed by Mr. Reagan and the Soviet Union leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1987 that reduced the size of each country’s nuclear arsenal.Walter LaFeber, a professor emeritus of American history at Cornell University, said that Mr. Shultz was able to offer the United States a sense of continuity when Ronald Reagan began to slip intellectually, and he did so without alienating the president or his wife, Nancy Reagan, a key power broker within his administration.Mr. Shultz “was dealing with a president that was not fully versed on foreign policy,” Professor LaFeber said. “Reagan trusted Shultz.”Madeleine Albright and the Multi-Polar WorldAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States found itself in a position it had never previously held, as the world’s sole superpower.Tensions with the Soviets had informed the country’s foreign policy since the end of World War II. Secretaries of state had to reshape that policy in a world in which it could not define itself against an “evil empire.” Furthermore, the information revolution was beginning to bring what were once far-flung nations closer together.Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argued that this combination of a multipolar world and new communications technology meant that the secretary of state was now charged with both producing a coherent vision that could advance the country’s interests while managing inside the department even more — which also meant more air travel than ever before.But she and others said that Madeleine K. Albright, Bill Clinton’s second secretary of state and the first woman to hold the post, largely succeeded in managing this new world.“Albright understood that in the post-Cold War world, what she needed to do was project the U.S. as the arbiter of the free world in a very different way,” Ms. Kleinfeld said. “Human rights, democracy, rule of law, these were the organizing principles that would allow the U.S. to keep an alliance system in a world where the old order had broken down.”Ms. Albright was able to project U.S. power, by couching that power in values that could be pitched as having won the war. But she was not a woolly liberal, Ms. Kleinfeld said. She interfered in other countries’ affairs, promoting human rights in China. She set up military exercises in the former Soviet Union and encouraged former Soviet engineers to work for the United States. She even visited North Korea in 2000 to attempt to persuade the Kim regime to end its missile tests.“She did very specific things to make the world safer by using the banner of liberal values,” Ms. Kleinfeld said.It was in this era that the secretary of state found herself contending with the heads of other agencies that had increasing had their own interests overseas. That competition within the cabinet has only increased in the last 20 years.Powell, Rice, Clinton and KerryUnder George W. Bush and Barack Obama, secretaries of state found themselves jockeying for control of policy with the heads of other agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury and the Pentagon, as well as the White House itself.Those agencies’ involvement in overseas decision-making only deepened after Sept. 11, which drove home the risks of nonstate actors like Al Qaeda and prompted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.“Military issues form a larger part of the foreign policy portfolio,” Mr. Sestanovich said of this period. “And that means the secretary of state is not exactly playing catch-up but always needs to reassert the important of diplomacy.”Asked about Mr. Bush’s two secretaries, Colin L. Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and Mr. Obama’s, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, Mr. Sestanovich said, “You have to say that these are all secretaries of state that had some trouble getting control of policy for themselves.”Even Mr. Powell, whom Ms. Kleinfeld said may have been the strongest of the four, was betrayed by conflicting interests within the executive branch when he delivered a detailed description of Iraqi weapons programs that did not exist to the United Nations in 2003. The speech relied on information that some intelligence agents knew was unreliable. Mr. Powell, a former general and the first African-American to hold the post, later described the speech as a “blot” on his record.Mr. Tillerson’s tensions with Mr. Trump can be seen as a part of that lineage. But Professor LaFeber emphasized that the public mistrust between the two was an anomaly. He could think of only one other example in American history of a similar relationship, between Abraham Lincoln and his secretary of state, William H. Seward.“Seward’s view of Lincoln is like Tillerson’s view of Trump,” Mr. LaFeber said. “When he called Trump a moron, I think that was from the heart.”He said that that was what Mr. Seward had initially thought of President Lincoln, “not a moron, but a person unversed in foreign policy.”Still, Mr. LaFeber warned, even that historical precedent did not quite help to illuminate Mr. Trump’s relationship with his first secretary of state.While Mr. Tillerson was thought by many to have mismanaged the State Department and contributed to his own irrelevance within the administration, Professor LaFeber said that he had been actively trying to remedy problems that the United States was confronting, problems that Mr. Trump was exacerbating.“If you evaluate presidents, you have to evaluate the first 44 and put Trump into another category entirely,” he said. “He’s so different, so ignorant of so many issues, particularly foreign policy. And Tillerson is a victim of that.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/trump-cabinet.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump took no immediate action Friday morning to remove top members of his administration, despite continuing reports of a coming reshuffling that have left White House aides uncertain and unsettled.Two embattled cabinet secretaries — Ben Carson at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and David Shulkin at the Department of Veterans Affairs — remained in their posts despite speculation that they would be replaced because of the president’s unhappiness with their use of public funds.There have also been strong indications that Mr. Trump intends to fire Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, his second national security adviser, after the dismissal earlier in the week of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson.John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, met at the White House with Mr. Carson on Friday morning, but no announcement was made about his future or that of Mr. Shulkin.The absence of any formal announcements — or firings by presidential tweet — suggested that the White House was seeking to tamp down the anxiety inside the West Wing and the impression that the Trump administration is gripped by dysfunction.Late Thursday night, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a tweet that reports of General McMaster’s imminent firing were not true.“Just spoke to @POTUS and Gen. H.R. McMaster — contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC,” she wrote.But the lack of any resolution to the reports of coming firings is leaving many of the president’s top advisers in a kind of political limbo that threatens to undermine their effectiveness until their fates are revealed, one way or the other.General McMaster, whose job requires him to negotiate internal disputes among factions within the administration, as well as deal directly with foreign officials, is operating with the public expectation that every day may be his last.Attorney General Jeff Sessions remains at odds with the president, who has repeatedly — and publicly — demeaned his tenure at the head of the Justice Department, leaving it an open question how much longer he will remain in charge.Mr. Kelly, too, is trying to run a White House under the cloud of reports that the president is looking for a replacement. Chiefs of staff to previous presidents have said that uncertainty is likely to hobble Mr. Kelly’s ability to operate effectively.And both Mr. Carson and Mr. Shulkin are presiding over complex departments, and those efforts are likely to be more difficult if career officials and outside interest groups believe they could soon be ousted.The Veterans Affairs inspector general issued a scathing report this year describing “serious derelictions” related to a trip Mr. Shulkin took last year to Britain and Denmark that cost more than $122,000. The report prompted bitter infighting within the department among Mr. Shulkin and his top lieutenants, generating politically damaging headlines for the administration.Mr. Carson, the highest-ranking African-American man in an overwhelmingly white administration, had been dogged by the continuing story of HUD’s purchase of a $31,000 dining set for his office. Mr. Carson initially claimed that neither he nor his wife, Candy, were involved in the selection of the dining room table, chairs and hutch when he was confronted with reports that the purchase far exceeded the $5,000 federal limit on office renovations.But this week, the department released emails showing that Mr. Carson and his wife were, in fact, involved, down to reviewing a dozen swatches of material used on the seats of the 10 chairs, each costing taxpayers $600 to $700.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/obituaries/louise-slaughter-dies.html","Louise M. Slaughter, a liberal Democrat who represented an upstate New York district in Congress for more than three decades, pushing to protect health privacy and abortion rights and playing a key role in the passage of President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul, died on Friday in Washington. She was 88 and in the midst of her 16th term in the House.In announcing her death, at George Washington University Hospital, her chief of staff, Liam Fitzsimmons, said Ms. Slaughter had sustained an injury last week at her home in Washington.Ms. Slaughter was a native of rural Kentucky who moved to the Rochester area with university degrees in microbiology and public health. Her studies shaped her agenda in the House, to which she was first elected in 1986 to represent Rochester and its surroundings.She rose to become the first chairwoman of the House Committee on Rules, which was formally constituted in 1789. She remained its ranking member.Legislation that Ms. Slaughter proposed in 1995, and for which she pressed repeatedly, was finally enacted in 2008 as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, aimed at banning discrimination by employers and insurers based on a person’s genetic information.She was equally persistent as a leader of a yearslong drive for a law to curb the widespread use of antibiotics in healthy cattle, pigs and chickens, a practice used to speed their growth.She and other critics said the practice had contributed to the emergence of bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics and capable of passing their resistance to human pathogens. But with livestock producers vigorously against the legislation, it had not been enacted at her death, to her great frustration. She had continued to call the stalling of the bill a bipartisan failure.Ms. Slaughter was chairwoman of the rules committee when Democrats were in the majority in the House from 2007 to 2010. The panel controls the debate and amendment process on the House floor, and she used its power to advance the Affordable Care Act, which passed the House by just five votes in 2009; all Republicans but one voted against it.The week President Obama signed the act, Ms. Slaughter was one of at least 10 Democratic lawmakers around the country targeted with vandalism and threats. A brick was thrown into one of her congressional offices, in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and a telephone message mentioning snipers was left on an answering machine at a campaign office. She accused Republicans of “fanning the flames with coded rhetoric.”Overall, Ms. Slaughter said on another occasion, “there are a lot of people in the United States that have just abject hate for the government.” Those who felt otherwise, she said, had the duty to convince them “that this government is not their enemy.”A longtime co-chairwoman of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus, Ms. Slaughter was a leader in fighting moves to reduce the scope of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. When the House defeated a 1989 measure to continue barring the District of Columbia from paying for abortions, she declared, “I don’t think there’s anything worse for women in this country than to watch men in blue suits debating this issue.”Ms. Slaughter, who was known for speaking bluntly in her Kentucky drawl, also helped lead a successful effort in 1994 to enact the Violence Against Women Act, which included federal funds for domestic violence shelters and for training the police, prosecutors and judges to better understand and respond to violent crimes against women. She was also prominent in calling on the Pentagon to crack down on sexual assaults of women in the military.Ms. Slaughter publicly regretted one success. In 1991 she was one of several congresswomen who marched to the Senate side of the Capitol to demand, successfully, that Anita F. Hill’s accusations of sexual harassment against Judge Clarence Thomas be heard during his confirmation proceedings after he was nominated for the Supreme Court.But Ms. Slaughter and others believed Ms. Hill was treated harshly when testifying before a Senate committee, and after Judge Thomas’s confirmation by the full Senate, Ms. Slaughter told The Boston Globe, “I felt guilty I’d ever asked them to go into it.”Although Ms. Slaughter voted against impeaching President Bill Clinton in the scandal over his sexual activities with a young White House intern, she did not hide her anger toward him — and not only for what she deemed his reckless behavior in that episode. She had long believed that Mr. Clinton had made too many deals with the Republicans.“I’m not interested in what happens to Bill Clinton,” she said in opposing impeachment. “It’s the country and the Constitution I’m concerned about.”The House impeached Mr. Clinton, but the Senate acquitted him.In 2012, as President Obama signed a bill that banned insider trading by members of Congress, he praised Ms. Slaughter for having introduced the first version of the legislation six years earlier and continuing to fight for it.A longtime co-leader of the Congressional Arts Caucus, Ms. Slaughter was involved in the annual battles to increase, or at least maintain, funding levels for federal arts and humanities agencies.She also worked for economic development aid to combat the declining fortunes of upstate New York, where her district at times stretched west from the Rochester area to Buffalo and Niagara Falls. And she opposed treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying they contributed to job losses in the United States.Dorothy Louise McIntosh was born on Aug., 14, 1929, in Lynch, Ky., to Oscar McIntosh and the former Daisy Grace Byers. She was often described in news articles and some campaign materials as a “coal miner’s daughter,” but her father had actually worked for coal mines as a blacksmith, a spokeswoman for Ms. Slaughter said in 2015. He later owned his own business as a machinist.Ms. Slaughter graduated from Somerset High School, in Somerset, Ky., in 1947 and earned a bachelor of science degree in microbiology and a master’s degree in public health, both from the University of Kentucky, in the early 1950s. She worked in market research for a chemical manufacturer before she and her husband, Robert Slaughter, whom she married in 1957, moved to the Rochester area, where he had obtained a job.Mr. Slaughter, who worked for the American Can and Eastman Kodak companies, died in 2014. Ms. Slaughter is survived by their three daughters, Megan Secatore, Amy Slaughter and Emily Minerva; seven grandchildren; and one great-grandson.Ms. Slaughter began her career in elective office by serving in the Monroe County Legislature from 1976 to 1979. She served in the New York State Assembly from 1983 to 1986, when she won her first term in Congress by narrowly defeating a Republican incumbent, Fred J. Eckert.Ms. Slaughter was handily re-elected every two years until 2014, when, in a year in which the Republicans increased their majority in the House, she squeaked through to victory by fewer than 1,000 votes against her Republican challenger, Mark Assini, a town supervisor in the area.In a rematch with him in 2016, however, voters, by a 12-point margin, sent Ms. Slaughter, the dean of New York’s congressional delegation, back to Capitol Hill.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/trump-rally-violence.html","A study published on Friday appears to confirm what news reports suggested long ago: President Trump’s campaign rallies were associated with a rise in violence when they came to town.A city that hosted a Trump rally saw an average of 2.3 more assaults reported on the day of the event than on a typical day, according to the study, led by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and published in the journal Epidemiology. The authors found no corresponding link between assaults and rallies for Mr. Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.“It appeared to be a phenomenon that’s unique to Donald Trump’s rally,” said Christopher Morrison, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania and the lead author of the study.It may come as little surprise that the rallies were associated with increased violence, as the often volcanic clashes between Mr. Trump’s supporters and opponents were widely covered at the time.In March 2016 alone, a Trump rally in Chicago was called off after violent clashes broke out, while an anti-Trump protester was punched at a rally in North Carolina and another was punched and kicked at a rally in Arizona. The following month, several Trump supporters were assaulted at a California rally.Mr. Trump himself repeatedly seemed to endorse attacks on his detractors, too.“Maybe he should have been roughed up,” he said of one protester who was reportedly punched and kicked in November 2015. “I’d like to punch him in the face, I’ll tell ya,” he said of another a few months later. He even offered to pay legal fees for his supporters if they became too aggressive.The supporters also often aimed offensive and violent rhetoric at Mrs. Clinton, suggesting she be killed.To determine whether those words and news reports corresponded with an actual shift in violence, the researchers compiled a list of 31 Trump rallies and 38 Clinton rallies held in cities with assault data available online.They compared the number of assaults reported on the day of the rally to the number reported on the corresponding day of the week, for each of the four weeks before and after the event.On a typical day, cities saw an average of 19.4 assaults, they found. On the day of a Trump rally, that number rose to 21.7.The pattern held even when the researchers controlled for the influence of factors like population size, data sources and the day used for the comparison.The researchers offered two explanations for the increase in assaults. Either they were the result of clashes at or near the rallies, or they occurred elsewhere in the cities after the aggressive mood on display by Mr. Trump, his supporters or his opponents had spread through “social contagion.”There were some limitations to the findings, the authors noted. They may not apply to the rallies or cities that weren’t studied, and a greater police presence during the rallies may have made it more likely for an assault to be reported.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/seven-troops-killed-helicopter-crash-iraq.html","WASHINGTON — All seven service members aboard a military helicopter died in a crash in western Iraq on Thursday, United States officials said on Friday. The crash is under investigation but is not believed to be a result of enemy action.The aircraft, an HH-60 Pave Hawk, crashed near the city of Qaim, where the American military uses a base as a logistics center and resupply hub. Iraqi security forces responded quickly and secured the area, according to a statement from Brig. Gen. Jonathan P. Braga, the director of operations for the American-led coalition battling the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.The Defense Department said it would not release the names of the deceased American service members until their families have been notified.The helicopter crashed about 18 miles southeast of the center of Qaim, near a phosphate factory and railway station close to the military base that the Americans use, said Ahmed al-Mahilawi, the mayor of Qaim. Residents said it crashed shortly after takeoff, he said in a telephone interview.President Trump offered his condolences in a Twitter post.Coalition forces have sealed the area, Mr. Mahilawi said, adding that preliminary indications were that the helicopter suffered from a technical malfunction.Qaim is in Anbar Province near the Syrian border, an area that continues to pose a serious threat to the American-led command fighting the Islamic State.“This tragedy reminds us of the risks our men and women face every day in service of our nations,” General Braga said. “We are thinking of the loved ones of these service members today.”The helicopter that crashed is typically flown by the United States Air Force for medical evacuations. The aircraft, a modified version of the Black Hawk helicopter, is also used by Special Operations pararescue specialists.American forces and Iraqi partners have been winding down their operations against the Islamic State, but fighters pushed from urban centers in Iraq have escaped to the desert along the border to hide.Iraqi security forces carry out weekly operations to try to clear the area of militants. American forces provide surveillance, intelligence and air support to Iraqi-led military missions, United States officials have said.

Trump.A person briefed on the process, who would speak about it only on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that the segment with the porn star, Stephanie Clifford, would run then.Ms. Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, spoke with the “60 Minutes” contributor Anderson Cooper last week.Ms. Clifford went forward with the interview, which her lawyer first hinted about in a tweet featuring a photograph of him, Ms. Clifford and Mr. Cooper. It proceeded despite an arbitrator’s ruling reaffirming an agreement that she reached with Mr. Trump in October 2016 to remain silent about their alleged relationship in exchange for $130,000.She has said she had a consensual relationship with Mr. Trump that started in 2006 and lasted several months.In recent weeks, Ms. Clifford’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, has led a publicity blitz, appearing frequently on cable news shows, since she filed a lawsuit on March 6 seeking to break her 2016 agreement.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/trump-jr-divorce-vanessa.html","Vanessa Haydon Trump, the wife of President Trump’s oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., filed for divorce on Thursday afternoon in a Manhattan court.Ms. Trump, 40, is seeking an uncontested divorce to end her 12-year marriage with the president’s son. Mr. Trump, 40, the eldest of five children from President Trump’s three marriages, met his wife, a former model, when his father introduced them at a 2003 fashion show. They married in 2005 at Mar-a-Lago, the family’s club in Palm Beach, Fla. They have five children.“After 12 years of marriage, we have decided to go our separate ways,” the couple said in a joint statement. “We will always have tremendous respect for each other and our families. We have five beautiful children together and they remain our top priority. We ask for your privacy during this time.”The couple live in Midtown Manhattan during the week, and the family often spends weekends in the Catskills.Mr. Trump and his brother Eric, 34, took over the management of the Trump Organization after their father was elected president. While his sister Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, moved to Washington and took senior jobs in the White House, Donald Trump Jr. chose to stay in New York after the election.He has stayed in close contact with his father, often defending the Trump administration on Twitter and in interviews on Fox News, and he recently campaigned in Pennsylvania for the Republican candidate in a special election.The White House special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is examining a June 2016 meeting Donald Trump Jr. had with Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton and the president’s role in providing a misleading response to The New York Times last summer for an article about the meeting.Last month, Vanessa Trump and her mother were hospitalized as a precaution after opening an envelope containing a white powdery substance that was later determined to be cornstarch, police officials said. A Massachusetts man was charged with sending the threatening letter. “No one should ever have to deal with this kind of sickening behavior,” Donald Trump Jr. said on Twitter about the episode.A onetime model with the Wilhelmina agency, Ms. Trump was raised on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and once dated the actor Leonardo DiCaprio. At the time of their engagement, Mr. Trump accepted a ring from the Bailey Banks & Biddle jewelry store in Short Hills, N.J., in exchange for publicity, recreating his proposal in a New Jersey mall.The two were married 10 months after Donald J. Trump married the former model Melania Knauss. In an interview last year with The Times, Donald Trump Jr. said a romantic evening with his wife included dinner at home (he likes to cook) and, perhaps, a movie. He tweeted about when his wife “took/dragged” him to see “Fifty Shades Darker.” (He didn’t love it.)Using her Twitter account with the handle @MrsVanessaTrump, Ms. Trump frequently retweeted her husband’s posts pertaining to family life, many of which include photographs of their weekends in the Catskills. But her tweets about him appeared to stop in June 2017. The last tweet referring to her husband was a family portrait in which she wished the president a happy birthday.Mr. Trump, who is active on Instagram, has posted mostly photos of him and his children in recent months. The last photograph with his wife was a photo of the family in February, when they were in Palm Beach celebrating a son’s birthday.The New York Post first reported the divorce filing on Thursday.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/larry-kudlow-profile-trump.html","WASHINGTON — Long before Donald J. Trump decided to run for president, Larry Kudlow was selling his future tax plan.Mr. Kudlow spent the years leading up to the 2016 election trying to convince every potential Republican candidate that by slashing corporate tax rates, America’s rate of economic growth could double. His arguments foreshadowed Mr. Trump’s pitch for the tax cuts he would sign as president in late 2017.“The single group that benefits the most from a lower corporate tax is the middle-class wage earner,” Mr. Kudlow said in a February 2015 interview, “and every study shows that.”Several studies dispute that, but they do not deter Mr. Kudlow, whom Mr. Trump picked this week to head the National Economic Council. Mr. Kudlow is not an academic economist. He is a Wall Street economist, a polished television host and, most of all, an evangelist for supply-side economics, which espouses that cutting taxes on businesses and the rich will rain down benefits on everyone else in the country.Mr. Kudlow believes that limiting the federal government will unleash Reagan-level economic growth, and he derides the “highly flawed econometric models” of economists whose forecasts do not share his optimism, including those at the Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress’s economic scorekeeper.His zeal has led him to issue some predictions that beat consensus and others that were wildly wrong, including twice denying the existence of recessions while they were already underway during President George W. Bush’s administration. (“Despite all the doom and gloom from the economic pessimistas,” he wrote in December 2007, right as the worst recession in a generation was beginning, “the resilient U.S. economy continues moving ahead.”)But his preaching is consistent, effective and entertaining. Mr. Kudlow’s admirers say it might be just what Mr. Trump needs right now, at a time when the economy is humming but Americans aren’t giving the president or his party much credit for it.“He’s a great guy to have in a bull market, freewheeling economy,” said James Pethokoukis, a columnist for the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a regular guest on Mr. Kudlow’s syndicated radio show. “He was made to be a spokesman for an administration in that kind of economy.”Mr. Trump is confident that the economy is roaring and that he deserves credit for it, as evidenced by his announcement of Mr. Kudlow’s appointment Thursday on Twitter.Americans are similarly confident in the economy’s performance, but that is not translating into widespread approval for Mr. Trump or his signature economic policies. A survey of 10,089 adults conducted this month for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey found that consumer confidence was strong, and remained at its highest point since Mr. Trump took office.But only 44 percent of respondents approved of Mr. Trump’s performance in office, compared with 54 percent who disapproved.The poll found support dipping slightly for Mr. Trump’s signature tax law: 49 percent of respondents approved of the bill, down from 51 percent in February, while 46 percent disapproved. That drop signals a potential ceiling of support for the new law, which had gained popularity after Mr. Trump signed it. In a worrying sign for conservatives, “strong” approval of the bill among Republicans and Republican-leaning respondents fell to 46 percent from 52 percent.Promoting the tax law did not prove to be an effective strategy for Republicans in a special congressional election this week in Pennsylvania.After flooding the airwaves of a district that Mr. Trump won by 20 percentage points in 2016 with tax-themed advertisements, Republicans shifted strategy for their closing argument, apparently judging the message to be ineffective. Their nominee, Rick Saccone, lost the race narrowly to  Conor Lamb, a Democrat.Mr. Kudlow, though, sees the tax law as a boon for the country and a powerful messaging weapon in the midterm elections this fall. He told his longtime colleagues at CNBC in an interview on Wednesday that one of his roles in the administration will be helping Mr. Trump persuade more Americans to see the law similarly.“The president likes me as a media communicator,” Mr. Kudlow said, “so I will be more than happy to oblige.”Most recent directors of the National Economic Council have not been academic economists, but the role has traditionally demanded more policy advice than salesmanship. The director is in effect the point person in the White House for economic issues, coordinating advice from across the cabinet and the West Wing. Mr. Trump’s advisers generally agree on tax issues, but they often diverge on trade, with warring factions between the traditional free-market group and a more populist group that reinforces Mr. Trump’s own inclinations and campaign talk.Mr. Kudlow is a longtime advocate of free trade, seeing it as critical to America’s economic growth. He criticized Mr. Trump’s recent plan to levy global tariffs on aluminum and steel, but has since endorsed a slightly more tailored version of the tariffs that Mr. Trump announced this month. His predecessor, Gary D. Cohn, announced that he would step down after losing the battle over those tariffs.Wall Street researchers were skeptical that Mr. Kudlow could persuade Mr. Trump to back away from his anti-trade agenda.“We expect that the president and Mr. Kudlow will be at odds over trade policy,” analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote on Wednesday, “but that the president’s view will prevail.”In the CNBC interview, Mr. Kudlow distilled the economic philosophy — including his love of tax cuts — that has animated him for four decades.“I believe, first of all, the greatest and most important thing for this or any other country is rapid prosperity for everyone,” Mr. Kudlow said. “If you keep tax rates minimal, if you keep regulations and government spending minimal, if you keep the dollar sound and steady, you are going to have a terrific economy.”He also emphasized how he, like Mr. Trump, viewed the stock market as a barometer for economic success. “Look, I love the stock market,” he said. “I love wealth. I think rising stocks help everybody.”Faith in those principles has at times led Mr. Kudlow to better his peers in economic forecasting, most notably in the late 1970s, when he bet against Wall Street’s consensus predictions that inflation would remain low. Mr. Kudlow also cites economic growth during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, and what he calls the five-year “boom” that followed the permanent tax cuts Mr. Bush signed into law in 2003, as evidence of the power of the supply side policies he preaches.But Mr. Kudlow has been off on other predictions.Like many conservatives, he warned in 2010 that the Federal Reserve, which invested trillions of dollars to help prop up the economy, risked stoking rapid inflation, which did not happen.He said in 1993 that President Bill Clinton’s “across-the-board tax increases on labor, capital and energy will throw a wet blanket over the recovery and depress the economy’s long-run potential to grow.” Several booming years later, in 1998, he was telling conservatives to cut taxes and expect a surge of new federal revenue to follow for years to come. It did surge, briefly, but large budget deficits returned in the mid-2000s and have hung around.Critics worry that Mr. Kudlow could miss the warning signs of another recession, or advise against government action to help pull the country out of any economic dip that might occur.Liberal groups criticized Mr. Kudlow this week for dismissing concerns about inequality and the pay gap between women and men, and for his critiques of expanded safety net programs — which he has said discourage work and contributed to slow growth under Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama. He has also expressed opposition to the federal minimum wage.Those critics who have jousted with him on air for years also say that Mr. Kudlow is, almost uniquely in the spirited world of economic debate, an engaging and curious adversary.“There’s probably nobody I disagree with more, and like as much,” said Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who advised Mr. Obama.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/trump-organization-subpoena-mueller-russia.html","WASHINGTON — The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has subpoenaed the Trump Organization in recent weeks to turn over documents, including some related to Russia, according to two people briefed on the matter. The order is the first known instance of the special counsel demanding records directly related to President Trump’s businesses, bringing the investigation closer to the president.The breadth of the subpoena was not clear, nor was it clear why Mr. Mueller issued it instead of simply asking for the documents from the company, an umbrella organization that encompasses Mr. Trump’s business ventures. Mr. Mueller ordered the Trump Organization to hand over records related to Russia and other topics he is investigating, the people said.The subpoena is the latest indication that the investigation, which Mr. Trump’s lawyers once regularly assured him would be completed by now, will continue for at least several more months. Word of the subpoena came as Mr. Mueller appears to be broadening his inquiry to examine the role foreign money may have played in funding Mr. Trump’s political activities. In recent weeks, Mr. Mueller’s investigators have questioned witnesses, including an adviser to the United Arab Emirates, about the flow of Emirati money into the United States.Mr. Mueller has already indicted 13 Russians and three companies accused of meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, and on Thursday, the Trump administration included them in sanctions it leveled at Moscow as punishment for interference in the campaign and “malicious cyberattacks.”The Trump Organization has typically complied with requests from congressional investigators for documents for their own inquiries into Russian election interference, and there was no indication the company planned to fight Mr. Mueller’s order.“Since July 2017, we have advised the public that the Trump Organization is fully cooperative with all investigations, including the special counsel, and is responding to their requests,” said Alan S. Futerfas, a lawyer representing the Trump Organization. “This is old news and our assistance and cooperation with the various investigations remains the same today.”The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, reiterated during her daily briefing that the president was cooperating with the special counsel inquiry and referred further questions to the Trump Organization.There are few other publicly known examples of Mr. Mueller using subpoenas. In January, he ordered the president’s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, to appear before a grand jury. Mr. Mueller dropped the subpoena after Mr. Bannon agreed to be interviewed by investigators.Mr. Mueller could run afoul of a line the president has warned him not to cross. Though it is not clear how much of the subpoena is related to Mr. Trump’s business outside ties to Russia, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The New York Times in July that the special counsel would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family’s finances beyond any relationship with Russia. The president declined to say how he would respond if he concluded that the special counsel had crossed that line.Mr. Trump campaigned as a businessman whose deal-making prowess would translate directly into reforming Washington. The argument helped propel him to the White House, but the Trump Organization has been a magnet for criticism from Democrats, ethics watchdogs and some Republicans, who expressed concern that he remained vulnerable to conflicts of interest because he did not separate from the company.Before Mr. Trump was sworn in, he pledged that he would stay uninvolved in his businesses while in office but insisted it would be too punitive for his business partners for him to divest from the company altogether.Among the Trump Organization’s holdings are golf clubs, hotels and licensing agreements for the use of the Trump name on properties and other products. While its holdings are complex, the company has always been run like a small, family-owned business; Mr. Trump brought in his three eldest children to help run the enterprise.The Trump Organization is not publicly held, making it difficult to determine where it receives its money and invests it. The company has said that it never had real estate holdings in Russia, but witnesses recently interviewed by Mr. Mueller have been asked about a possible real estate deal in Moscow.In 2015, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump’s, Felix Sater, emailed Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, at his Trump Organization account claiming he had ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and that building a Trump Tower in Moscow would help Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. Mr. Trump signed a nonbinding letter of intent for the project in 2015 and discussed it at least three times with Mr. Cohen.A revealing comment about Russia by Eric Trump, the president’s middle son, also drew scrutiny when it emerged last year. James Dodson, a longtime golf writer from North Carolina, said offhand in a radio interview that Eric Trump, who oversees the golf courses for the Trump Organization, told him in 2013 that the Trumps relied on Russian investors to back their golf clubs. Eric Trump has denied those remarks.Mr. Mueller was appointed in May to investigate whether Mr. Trump’s campaign colluded with the Russians to influence the 2016 election and any other matters that may arise from the inquiry.A month later, the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to quit after Mr. Trump asked him to have Mr. Mueller fired because the president believed he had conflict-of-interest issues that precluded him from running the special counsel investigation.Mr. Mueller is also examining whether the president has tried to obstruct the investigation.Mr. Trump’s lawyers are in negotiations with Mr. Mueller’s office about whether and how to allow his investigators to interview the president. Mr. Mueller’s office has shared topics it wants to discuss with the president, according to two people familiar with the talks. The lawyers have advised Mr. Trump to refuse an interview, but the president has said he wants to do it, as he believes he has done nothing wrong and can easily answer investigators’ questions.At the same time, Mr. Trump is considering whether to bring on a new lawyer to help represent him in the special counsel’s investigation. Last week, Mr. Trump spoke with Emmet T. Flood, a longtime Washington lawyer who represented former President Bill Clinton during the impeachment process, about coming into the White House to deal with the inquiry.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/trump-repeats-false-claim-about-canada-after-admitting-uncertainty-over-figure.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump repeated on Thursday his false assertion that the United States runs a trade deficit with Canada, the morning after privately telling Republican donors that he had deliberately insisted on that claim in a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada without knowing whether it was true.Mr. Trump’s private admission to having a loose grasp of the facts and his public refusal to back down from the incorrect statement — the United States has an overall surplus in trade with Canada — were vivid illustrations of the president’s cavalier attitude about the truth, and a reminder of how that approach has taken hold at the White House.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump had chosen his figures selectively in the conversation with Mr. Trudeau and in a subsequent Twitter post that repeated the claim. The president was referring only to the trade of goods, Ms. Sanders said, which ignores the larger trade surplus in services the United States exports to Canada.And in a briefing with reporters, she acknowledged that Mr. Trump had fabricated an anecdote he told the donors about unfair trading practices — Japanese officials, he claimed, conduct a test on American cars by dropping a bowling ball on their hoods from 20 feet high, and those that dent are barred from being imported.“Obviously, he’s joking about this particular test,” Ms. Sanders told reporters who confronted her about the veracity of the tale. “But it illustrates the creative ways some countries are able to keep American goods out of their markets.”Her explanation came two weeks after Hope Hicks, the White House communications director, told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that she sometimes told white lies on behalf of Mr. Trump.The latest instance of Mr. Trump bending the truth emerged after The Washington Post published an account of the president boasting about his disingenuous exchange with Mr. Trudeau at a fund-raising dinner on Wednesday night in Missouri. On Thursday, the president refused to back down from the erroneous claim about the trade balance between the United States and Canada.“We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive),” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. In an audio recording from the dinner obtained by The Post, a transcript of which was published on Thursday, Mr. Trump recounted how he pressed that point in a meeting with Mr. Trudeau even though he had “no idea” whether it was true.“P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S. (negotiating), but they do,” Mr. Trump added in his tweet.The United States ran a trade surplus of $600 million in goods and services with Canada in January, according to the Commerce Department, a metric that reflects the difference between what the United States exports to Canada and what it imports from that country. In 2016, the United States had a trade surplus with Canada of $12.5 billion, according to a fact sheet posted on the website of the United States trade representative.But during the fund-raiser for a Senate candidate in Missouri, Mr. Trump said he had refused to concede the point in a meeting with Mr. Trudeau, as the prime minister repeatedly pushed back.“He said, ‘No, no, we have no trade deficit with you, we have none; Donald, please,’” Mr. Trump told the donors according to the transcript, calling Mr. Trudeau a “nice guy, good-looking.”“I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do.’ I didn’t even know,” Mr. Trump said. “I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid.”Mr. Trump’s retelling drew rebukes from some diplomats and lawmakers who argued that it reflected a dangerous penchant by the commander in chief to misrepresent the truth.“The president’s admission that he’s literally making things up while speaking face-to-face with a world leader should stop us all in our tracks,” said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “How can any other government — ally or adversary — have any confidence in what our president says when he admits to lying?”The account was particularly extraordinary given that it reflected Mr. Trump’s willingness to dissemble even with a close ally of the United States, albeit one that he has taken on aggressively in recent months as he presses to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and secure terms that are more advantageous to the United States.During the conversation, the president said he and Mr. Trudeau had tangled repeatedly about the trade balance, with the prime minister saying, “Nope, we have no trade deficit,” and Mr. Trump ultimately sending an aide to, “Check, because I can’t believe it.”The president then claimed that his contention had been validated, appearing to quote an aide he said had told him, “‘Well sir you’re actually right. We have no deficit, but that doesn’t include energy and timber. But when you do, we lose $17 billion a year.’ It’s incredible.”Ms. Sanders repeated that rationale during her briefing on Thursday, saying that Mr. Trump had been “accurate” in his assertion to Mr. Trudeau. In a tweet, she later said both she and the president had been referring to the more than $17 billion trade deficit in goods last year between the United States and Canada.Census Bureau data shows that, when trade in services was counted, the surplus was $2.8 billion. While Mr. Trump has focused almost exclusively on trade in manufactured goods, his advisers note that omitting trade in services produces a skewed picture of the United States’ standing.“Focusing only on the trade in goods alone ignores the United States’ comparative advantage in services,” the president’s Council of Economic Advisers wrote last month in a report.Trade with the United States is a critical part of Canada’s export-dependent economy. But the actions and statements from the Trump administration concerning the economic relationship between the two countries have provoked equal parts anxiety, puzzlement and anger in Canada.Marc Garneau, who is the chairman of the Canada-U.S. relations committee in Mr. Trudeau’s cabinet, rejected on Thursday the president’s deficit claim.“At this point, it’s very important to point out that there is over $2 billion a day of trade between our two countries and over all annually the United States has a small surplus with Canada,” Mr. Garneau told reporters in Montreal.The president’s reported remarks dominated the news in Canada on Thursday morning and were greeted with bafflement by some.“If it came from any other world leader, it would be troubling,” said Mark Warner, an international trade lawyer in Toronto. “But pretty obviously, he’s not a details guy and he’s kind of got a negotiating strategy of being in the moment.”In Quebec, where Mr. Trump’s aggressive trade tactics, protectionist impulses and “America First” mantra have been met with concern and bemusement, Canadians said they were unimpressed by what some construed as just the latest example of obfuscation by Mr. Trump.“It is scary, as his lying has become the new normal,” said Cory Whiteduck, 35, a radio host and cigarette seller in Kitigan Zibi reserve, near Maniwaki, Quebec, about 85 miles north of Ottawa. “Normally, it would raise red flags, and a politician would be in trouble. It is not a productive way of doing things or a good mentality.”The account of the president’s slapdash approach to statistics comes after a dispute between Canada and the United States over potentially crippling duties on steel and aluminum that the president introduced last week.The sanctions were temporarily suspended in Canada’s case, pending renegotiation of Nafta. Officials in Mr. Trump’s administration insisted that the United States runs a steel trade deficit with Canada even though data from both governments show that trade is balanced.Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiators have presented a list of demands for revising Nafta that Canada has declared unacceptable. Mr. Trudeau has said that Canada is prepared to abandon Nafta rather than accept a “bad deal” and Mr. Trump has similarly threatened to withdraw from the pact.Bruce A. Heyman, the United States ambassador to Canada under President Barack Obama, said that Mr. Trump’s approach was “creating a crisis where none existed before.”“Lying to your friends only hurts the relationship,” Mr. Heyman wrote on Twitter. “Canada has been there for us thru thick and thin. How can you just casually damage this realtionship?”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/us/politics/trump-congressional-republicans-midterms.html","WASHINGTON — If Republicans and President Trump are going down to defeat in November’s midterms, they are evidently going down together.Faced with a mortifying special election loss in what had been a Trump-loving Pennsylvania House district, Republicans on Capitol Hill did not point fingers in the president’s direction. Instead, they blamed their candidate, Rick Saccone, for running a lackluster effort while crediting the president with putting Mr. Saccone within reach of victory by firing up Trump supporters at a rally last weekend.“The president came in and helped close this race and got it to where it is right now,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Wednesday as he and his fellow Republicans sought to put the best possible gloss on the latest and most definitive portent yet that their party — not to mention his own speakership — is in severe peril in a very challenging midterm election climate.Statements like those and other recent developments highlight just how reluctant Republicans are to put any daylight between themselves and Mr. Trump despite obvious political danger ahead.History has shown that a president’s popularity is a key factor in determining the extent of a governing party’s losses in midterm elections. Presidents almost always lose congressional seats in midterm contests, but those polling below 50 percent get hit particularly hard. With Mr. Trump’s approval rating now hovering around 40 percent, House Republicans face potential losses deep enough to cost them control of the House, handing Democrats formidable power to challenge the president in the final two years of his term.But congressional Republicans are also well aware that, among the conservative Republican base, Mr. Trump is more popular than they are. That reality is reflected by the fact that congressional Republicans and the White House have aligned themselves more closely on such high-profile issues as gun control and the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Congressional Republicans have also continued to shy away from talk of the president’s personal conduct and management of the White House.And despite a wide split between Republicans on Capitol Hill and Mr. Trump on his proposed new steel and aluminum tariffs, party leaders express little enthusiasm for directly taking on Mr. Trump even though they worry the new tariffs could roil the economy and undermine what they see as their best argument for re-election: tax cuts.“I think it’s highly unlikely we’d be dealing with that in a legislative way,” Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, told reporters on Tuesday, dismissing calls by some Republicans to block the tariffs via congressional action.Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee abruptly ended its investigation into Russian collusion this week, concluding that they could find no basis to believe the president or his allies did anything wrong. They also broke with an intelligence community consensus that the Russians meant to help Mr. Trump.Their finding came despite the fact that a special counsel continues a wide-ranging investigation that could produce different results. But it cheered Mr. Trump and the White House and reflected a view by many House Republicans that their own inquiry was unfairly undermining the president — and by extension themselves — and had gone on long enough.The decision drew a strong rebuke from Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.“Sadly, far too many of our friends on the other side of the aisle have been more concerned with protecting the president politically than defending our democracy,” said Mr. Schumer, who also noted the White House has refused to impose new sanctions on Russia that were ordered by Congress but has drawn no Republican criticism for its inaction. “From the top on down through the rank and file,” Mr. Schumer said, “the Republican Party that used to roar like a lion against Russia now squeaks like a mouse.”On gun control, the president only days ago seemed poised to offer a drastic departure from Republican orthodoxy on gun issues by pushing for more comprehensive background checks, raising the age limit to buy weapons and encouraging members of his party to be bold about breaking with the National Rifle Association. But instead of using presidential clout to push his party in a new direction and put lawmakers on the spot, the White House backed off and embraced more ideas more compatible with the N.R.A. while establishing a commission to explore other alternatives.On Wednesday, as students around the country demonstrated for new gun control laws, the Republican-led House passed a measure that focused more on physical improvements to bolster school safety, and the White House said it was most pleased with the progress.Despite intense public and news media scrutiny on Mr. Trump’s involvement with a pornographic film actress and payments to her by his personal attorney, top congressional Republicans have essentially ignored the subject, with Mr. Ryan saying recently that he had not “put a second of thought” into the topic. The administration’s continuing personnel turmoil has also elicited little public concern from congressional Republicans who continue to call for quick consideration and confirmation of nominees to fill increasing numbers of vacancies.While Republicans publicly deflected suggestions that the Pennsylvania race was a sign of a rejection of the president and an indictment of their own performance, party strategists acknowledged privately that the political environment represented real danger. They argue, however, that Republicans could still win by mounting strong campaigns and being prepared.For Congressional Republicans and the White House, that appears to mean sticking together, win or lose.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/world/africa/niger-green-berets-isis-firefight-december.html","WASHINGTON — Green Berets working with government forces in Niger killed 11 Islamic State militants in a firefight in December, the American military acknowledged for the first time on Wednesday. The battle occurred two months after four United States soldiers died in an ambush in another part of Niger — and after senior commanders had imposed stricter limits on military missions in the West African country.No American or Nigerien forces were harmed in the December gun battle. But the combat — along with at least 10 other previously unreported attacks on American troops in West Africa between 2015 and 2017 — indicates that the deadly Oct. 4 ambush was not an isolated episode in a nation where the United States is building a major drone base.After the ambush, senior officers at United States Africa Command, which oversees American military operations on the continent, imposed additional measures to enhance the safety of troops on missions that were designed to train and advise local forces in Niger.But the missions did not end.On the morning of Dec. 6, a combined force of Nigerien and American troops “came under fire from a formation of violent extremists,” Samantha Reho, a spokeswoman for Africa Command, said in a statement to The New York Times on Wednesday.She said the gun battle killed 11 militants — including two wearing suicide vests — who were believed to be affiliated with the Islamic State in West Africa. No American or Nigerien forces were killed or wounded, she said.It was the first time the American military has acknowledged the December firefight, and Ms. Reho gave no explanation for the Pentagon’s failure to disclose the episode at the time.The head of Africa Command, Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, did not mention the December battle in testimony to Congress this month and only broadly outlined the threats in the region. A senior House Republican aide said on Wednesday that lawmakers had been notified about the Dec. 6 attack soon after it happened.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is reviewing the results of a lengthy internal investigation into the October ambush, near the border with Mali, which set off a widespread debate about why American troops are fighting a shadowy war in Niger. A military official said on Wednesday that Mr. Mattis was wrestling with the investigation’s apparent attempts to blame low-level commanders for the deaths of the four soldiers and not implicate senior officers.The families of the soldiers — Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson and Sgt. La David Johnson — have not been told of the investigation’s conclusions, said the military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the findings have not yet been released.The Pentagon appears ready to scale back military operations in West Africa even further. A draft of the investigation, parts of which were described to The Times in February, called for the military to reduce the number of ground missions, and to strip commanders in the field of some authority to send troops on potentially high-risk patrols.Between 2015 and 2017, there were about 10 instances of American troops and local training partners being attacked in Niger and elsewhere in West Africa, said Brig. Gen. Donald C. Bolduc, the former commander of United States Special Operations in Africa.Enemy fighters were killed in some of those unreported episodes, General Bolduc said on Wednesday, but there were no American casualties. The existence of the Dec. 6 firefight was referenced in a terse line in an unclassified report the Trump administration gave to Congress this week about its legal and policy views on using military force. That report, obtained by The Times, mentioned only that a joint American-Nigerien force was attacked by a group of presumed Islamic State militants on that date, and returned fire “in self-defense.”Ms. Reho portrayed the firefight as an act of self-defense after the unit happened to come under attack.“The purpose of the mission was to set the conditions for future partner-led operations against violent extremist organizations in the region,” she said. “There was no aspect of this mission focused on pursuing enemy militants, and the combined force was postured to respond as necessary in case contact with the enemy occurred.”She added: “With that said, our forces do operate in unstable areas and are occasionally exposed to danger from enemy forces. When such a situation occurs, our personnel are authorized to respond to threats and violence appropriately.”However, another military official familiar with the Dec. 6 firefight, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, offered a different portrayal of the events.The official said that the Green Berets were assisting Nigerien forces on a multiday operation near Diffa, a city in southeastern Niger near the border with Nigeria. It sought to clear the potentially hostile area so that Nigerien forces could build a new outpost there. It is unclear if the small base was ever built.The mission had attracted attention among American forces after the firefight, the official said, because it was one of the first major forays into the field in Niger since the Oct. 4 ambush.The White House only this month approved giving combat pay to American troops deployed to Niger. Army soldiers in Niger are still not eligible for certain combat awards — including the Combat Infantry Badge and Combat Action Badge — that are highly respected and sometimes can help with promotion. The four soldiers who were killed in the Oct. 4 raid were given the awards posthumously, but those troops who have fought in Niger have not received them.Questions about whether the American military, under the Trump administration, is seeking to obscure the expanding scope of operations in Africa were raised last week when it was revealed that the United States carried out four airstrikes in Libya between September and January that Africa Command failed to disclose at the time. The military has said it will acknowledge such missions if asked about them, even if it does not affirmatively disclose them in a news release.The Dec. 6 firefight was the main nugget of new information in the report that the Trump administration submitted to Congress this week, and was eagerly awaited by specialists on national security issues related to counterterrorism operations.They hoped it would offer a thorough public explanation of issues — ranging from when the Trump administration thinks it can attack other countries without prior permission from Congress, to an acknowledgment that President Trump secretly relaxed limits on when the military or the Central Intelligence Agency can carry out kill-or-capture operations with drones or commando teams, away from conventional battlefields.But the unclassified portion of the report, which was just over eight pages long, largely consisted of a slightly rewritten version of last December’s version of the semiannual War Powers Resolution letter in which the executive branch lists deployments abroad.The unclassified report gave only terse descriptions of certain matters while making no mention of key topics like Mr. Trump’s changes to the drone strike rules, suggesting that they were relegated to the classified annex the public cannot see.“It’s disappointing to see this administration show disrespect for Congress’s effort to obtain public answers to key legal questions of our time,” said Joshua Geltzer, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council in the Obama administration.“This report was an opportunity to inform discussion on the Hill and, perhaps even more important, across the country on critical questions about when and why our country can take the grave step of using military force. That opportunity for a more robust public debate has now been lost.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/us/pennsylvania-election-lamb.html","BETHEL PARK, Pa. — There is the straightforward story about what happened on Tuesday in Western Pennsylvania: Another election in the Trump era, another surprising Democratic performance in the suburbs, this one in the affluent, but staunchly Republican townships south of Pittsburgh.But there is also a more refined account, one shared by the Trump lovers at Bob’s Diner and the Trump loathers at the Panera Bread down the road: Anti-Trump motivation is abundant, but in close races, candidates still matter.“I don’t have enough curse words to describe our current president,” said Paul Cohen, 74, a retired insurance broker eating lunch with his wife at Panera. But, he said, “I’m not necessarily a liberal. And to find a Democrat running as a centrist immediately got my attention.”This is a safe description of Conor Lamb, the Democratic candidate who on Wednesday claimed a razor-thin victory over the Republican candidate, State Representative Rick Saccone, in a special congressional election. Mr. Lamb — moderate on gun control, personally disapproving of abortion but against stricter bans and supportive of Mr. Trump’s plan to put tariffs on steel and aluminum — seemed a particularly good fit for this generally conservative district.“His positions were more Republican than Democrat,” said Deb Vosel, 62, a retired nurse sitting with her husband at Bob’s Diner. She knows plenty of people who voted for Mr. Trump and almost no one who regretted it. Many of the same people, she said, voted for Mr. Lamb. “In this neck of the woods,” she said, “people judge people on their merits.”As simple as that sounds, it should not detract from Mr. Lamb’s feat. The 18th Congressional District runs from the rural southwest corner of the state, a blue-collar wedge of gas fields and coal mines, up to the middle- and upper-class Pittsburgh suburbs, a mix of dependably Democratic communities and Republican strongholds.Many political experts had focused on whether Mr. Lamb could keep the vote close in rural areas, something he accomplished with a strong pitch to labor unions. But the scale of his margins in some suburbs was what surprised many, and likely pushed him over the top. Voters in the suburbs have also helped Democrats in other recent races, particularly in Alabama, where the Democrat, Doug Jones, beat the Republican favorite, Roy Moore.Mr. Trump easily won Bethel Park in 2016; four years earlier, Mitt Romney racked up a 24-point win in Upper St. Clair, the affluent township next door. On Tuesday, Mr. Lamb, whose campaign signs dot the manicured lawns, won both by 10 points.Mike DeVanney, a Republican political consultant in Pittsburgh, saw several things at work in Mr. Lamb’s campaign, all of which are warning signs for Republicans in the midterm races in November. For many, he said, this was “the first opportunity to voice an opinion on Donald Trump,” and that opinion, at least among the most motivated, was not favorable.But it also showed the value of picking candidates — in Mr. Saccone, 60, a social conservative who was not the natural choice for many suburban Republicans, and in Mr. Lamb, a telegenic 33-year-old former Marine.“You have to give credit,” Mr. DeVanney said. “He was clearly the best candidate they’ve run for this district. And not only the best candidate but he executed a strong campaign.”Some residents, even those who considered themselves Trump supporters, thought that most voters on Tuesday were only considering their disapproval of the president. The candidates themselves were more or less irrelevant.“Lightweights, the both of them,” said Gary Berman, 75, a retired engineer sitting in the food court of the upscale South Hills Village shopping mall. The area had changed, he said. The older people had been moving away to retire, while younger — and more liberal — people moved in.“They hate Trump,” he said of the newcomers. “That’s all that matters.”Other Republicans were not convinced it was so simple. They did not deny the energized antipathy toward Mr. Trump, which arguably made this campaign competitive in the first place. But in such a tight race, there are still factors the candidates control that can sway the outcome.Samuel DeMarco, a Republican who sits on the Allegheny County Council, kept returning to what he saw as Mr. Saccone’s missteps — poor fund-raising, missed events, the lack of a clear vision — particularly in contrast to the adroitness of Mr. Lamb.Mr. DeMarco saw little campaigning by Mr. Saccone on the two policy matters he could have championed — the tax plan that the Republicans passed in December and the planned steel tariffs — and instead saw a pitch that boiled down to little more than his support of Mr. Trump.“I don’t think the Saccone campaign ever gave the public a compelling reason to vote for him,” he said. “This is a Saccone thing when it comes to Republicans. It’s a Trump thing when it comes to Democrats.”Still, the distinction is not always so clear. For Janet Supko, 63, a retired schoolteacher who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, the election was all about the president.“There have got to be some changes made,” said Ms. Supko, who had just rounded the corner of Macy’s in her morning walk at South Hills Village. While she had benefited from the Republican’s income tax overhaul, she lamented the president’s “lack of professionalism,” the numerous hirings and firings, and the general sense of chaos in the White House.Mr. Lamb was young and fresh and new; maybe he represented the change she had been hoping for when she voted for Mr. Trump in the first place.“Sometimes,” she said, “you just have to try something else.”Her walking partner, Clare Rex, 68, was never a fan of Mr. Trump, but for her, in the end, the election was about Mr. Lamb.“I saw him at the fish fry at Our Lady of Grace,” she said. “He just seems to bring a fresh perspective.”The women came to the end of their walk at the Starbucks, where they met two friends, both Republicans, both Trump supporters, and neither surprised by what happened on Tuesday. Whether it was because of the Lamb campaign’s savvy or anti-Trump energy on the Democratic side, they said, the win for Mr. Lamb, even here in a place that had not voted Democratic in years, seemed inevitable.Over the weekend, Christine Sorbara, 72, had gone to President Trump’s rally in an airplane hangar in support of Mr. Saccone. She thought it probably helped him some. But around the district, she said, if it wasn’t Lamb yard signs, it was his supporters knocking on doors.“I saw Lamb, Lamb, Lamb,” she said.
         Correction: March 14, 2018  An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the voting history of the 18th Congressional District while paraphrasing two voters at a Starbucks. They said that their region had not voted Democratic in years, not that it had not voted Republican.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/16/593487330/conservatives-mobilize-grass-roots-activists-to-promote-trump-judges","A conservative group funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch is turning its attention to a new front: promoting federal judges at the grass-roots level. Americans for Prosperity is willing to spend nearly $1 million to confirm judges this year. Those lifetime appointments could reshape the courts for a generation.""The fact of the matter is that so much of what affects us in our daily lives plays out in the courtroom,"" said Sarah Field, the group's new vice president for judicial strategy.But even more important than the money could be the firepower AFP wants to engage. The idea is to mobilize conservative activists across 36 states for key confirmation fights this year. That includes people who call their home-state senators, write letters and knock on doors.For now, ground zero is in Wisconsin, where AFP state director Eric Bott said it's a little too cold to knock on doors just yet. Bott said his network of 130,000 volunteers has rallied for Tea Party causes, supported Republican Gov. Scott Walker and fought for limits on the state's collective bargaining laws. Now, those volunteers are turning their attention to judges.""A lot of our activists are really looking for certain types of jurists,"" he said. ""They want a judge who's going to respect the rule of law. They're looking for a judge who's going to interpret the Constitution as it was originally intended.""AFP has already thrown its support behind one of President Trump's judge picks this year — Michael Brennan, a Milwaukee lawyer and ally of Gov. Walker.Wisconsin's Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin, refused to turn in a blue slip for Brennan. The blue slip is a way for senators to signal support for a nominee. Withholding that paperwork usually means the end of a nomination, as Baldwin noted in a letter earlier this year.""President Trump's nomination of Mr. Brennan disregards the longstanding, bipartisan process in Wisconsin that has informed the selection of federal judges in my state,"" Baldwin said. ""This is a particularly troubling step at a time when institutions and traditions of democracy seem under constant attack, and bipartisanship feels like a fading concept.""But the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, broke with 100 years of tradition and held a hearing for Brennan anyway. Last month, Brennan advanced out of the committee on a party-line vote of 11 to 10. He's waiting for action by the full Senate.AFP is buying digital ads to encourage a quick vote.""This is a seat that has been vacant longer than any other seat on the federal bench and the people of Wisconsin deserve to see a judge confirmed on the 7th Circuit,"" said Sarah Field of AFP.Kristine Lucius of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said that's not the full story. Lucius pointed out that the current nominee, Michael Brennan, wrote an opinion piece supporting Republican efforts to block President Obama's pick for that same job. The delay strategy worked.""And to think that that person who defended that right would now enjoy the nomination and be critical of the other senator who is exercising her own rights is the epitome of hypocrisy,"" she added.Lucius now fights against many of Trump's selections for the federal courts. But she said she understands why AFP is stepping up its role.""To me it's not surprising that the Koch brothers, billionaire corporate leaders, would want to invest their money in the fight to get judges to uphold their corporate rights,"" Lucius said. ""They think this is money well spent because they are trying to tilt the bench. They are trying not to have rule of law that rules against them, but instead they want to get more people into lifetime positions that will rule in favor of corporate interests over individual interests.""Judges confirmed to lifetime posts already represent one of the president's most important accomplishments. And groups on both ends of the political spectrum know that other big fights are on the way.From her headquarters in Virginia, Sarah Field of AFP says she's gearing up.""Everything that we're doing is really pointing to the future of the Supreme Court,"" Field said.Unlike some other conservative groups, AFP intends to make federal judges a focus of its permanent grass-roots efforts."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/16/594213906/national-security-adviser-h-r-mcmaster-is-expected-to-leave-trump-administration","After one year in his job, national security adviser H.R. McMaster is expected to depart his White House position soon, U.S. officials tell NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman. Despite a denial from the Trump administration, the only thing that is reportedly holding up McMaster's departure is a transition plan.McMaster's exit has been the subject of rumors, in a similar way that outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had been viewed as not long for life under President Trump. Officials say McMaster, 55, could leave within weeks, possibly within a month or so.""We don't get a sense of when this will happen,"" Tom says, ""but we're told it will likely happen.""Information about Trump's desire to replace McMaster has been solidified by sources, despite a denial from White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who tweeted Thursday night that she had just spoken to Trump and McMaster and that ""contrary to reports they have a good working relationship and there are no changes at the NSC [National Security Council].""""Trump has publicly said that he respects H.R. McMaster, but their relationship has not been an easy one,"" Tom tells NPR's Rachel Martin on Morning Edition. ""There were some policy differences: H.R. favored an enduring commitment in Afghanistan, he served there for a time and actually wanted more troops sent over there. Others in the White House disagreed with that.""As for any possible personal rift between Trump and McMaster, Tom says, ""People in the Army say he's 'all transmit,' as they would put it: He likes to lecture. That rubs some people the wrong way — and the sense is, that rubs Trump the wrong way.""Some of McMaster's friends had reportedly advised him not to work for the new president — Tom cites some of their warnings: ""The president is mercurial, he has no background in military policy, foreign policy — so it was a tough job for him to take. But ... [McMaster] is very aggressive, has a big ego. I'm sure he thought that he could do a pretty good job here. But clearly, he's on his way out.""Trump publicly chastised McMaster last month, after the national security adviser said that ""the evidence is now really incontrovertible"" that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election that put Trump in the Oval Office.That statement spurred Trump to tweet, ""General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians"" and to deny any collusion.When McMaster accepted the national security adviser job in the Trump administration one year ago, he was stepping into a post that had been vacated by the firing of Michael Flynn, who is also a figure in the Russian investigation. In early 2017, reports cited McMaster's reluctance to take the position — and when he finally did take the job, McMaster retained his active-duty status as a lieutenant general in the Army.Tom says that he was told that while McMaster's departure is definite, the timing is uncertain — possibly within a month or two, officials said. But as Tom adds, ""With this White House, with the president tweeting, it could happen today. We have really no sense when it could happen.""When Trump fired Tillerson earlier this week, the news came in a tweet — evidently surprising Tillerson, despite long-swirling rumors and denials about his job security."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/16/593989347/facial-scanning-now-arriving-at-u-s-airports","The use of facial scanning is becoming commonplace — maybe you've heard of the new iPhone? It's also coming to an airport near you.  At Orlando International Airport, Britain-bound passengers — some wearing Mickey Mouse T-shirts and other Disney paraphernalia — lined up at Gate 80 recently for the evening British Airways flight to London's Gatwick Airport. It looks like any other airport departure area, except for the two small gates with what look like small boxes on posts next to them. Those boxes are actually cameras.They were installed this month by SITA, the Geneva-based company that develops information technology for the world's airlines, in conjunction with British Airways and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP.Sherry Stein, a senior manager at SITA, says the cameras are triggered when passengers step onto designated footprints. ""We collect a photo, send it to CBP,  who checks to make sure that person is booked on the manifest and matches the photo that they already have on file."" If everything matches, Stein says, ""we open the doors and give them the OK to board."" All that happens, she says, ""in three to five seconds.""If things don't match, the traveler's passport is scanned manually by a gate agent.CBP is testing biometric scanning at a dozen or so U.S. international airports to ensure that people leaving the country are who they say they are, and to prevent visa overstays. The Transportation Security Administration, another agency within the Department of Homeland Security, is testing similar devices at security check-in lines. Steve Karoly, acting assistant administrator at TSA, calls the use of biometrics ""a game changer"" for the aviation security. ""It will make things a little bit easier, more efficient at an airport environment,"" he says. Karoly predicts it will be a few more years before biometrics are in widespread use by TSA.  Critics like Harrison Rudolph of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown University Law School say the technology now isn't ready for prime time. Rudolph, co-author of a report released by the center in December, considers the system ""riddled with legal and technical problems.""Among the problems he cites is bias. ""DHS doesn't seem to know whether its system will falsely reject folks,"" that is, be unable to match the face scan with photos it has in the system, at higher rates because of their race or gender. ""That's a serious problem,"" he says.According to a report by the CAPA-Centre for Aviation, face-recognition software ""is not so good at identifying ethnic minorities when most of the subjects used in training the technology were from the majority group."" Another problem are passengers who are wearing glasses, hats or scarves.  Rudolph says about 4 percent of travelers are wrongly rejected by the system. Another concern he has: He says privacy protections are nonexistent. ""DHS hasn't issued a single rule under this program to protect Americans' privacy,"" Rudolph says. ""So what DHS decides to do with this information tomorrow, I'm not sure. And without rules there may be few protections for Americans' privacy."" CBP says it deletes the photos taken at airport gates within 14 days. Sean Farrell, director of strategy and innovation at SITA, says travelers seem to be comfortable with the new technology. ""We haven't seen that privacy as being a major concern for passengers,"" Farrell says. ""They seem to actually embrace this technology and are willing to provide a biometric in order to get the benefit of an improved boarding process.""Many travelers in Orlando whom NPR spoke with said they were happy with the process, although there was some grumbling by those at the end of the boarding queue. Comfortable or not, travelers should probably get used to the technology. President Trump signed an executive action last year urging the government to speed up the airport use of biometric tracking, and CBP hopes to have face scanners installed at all the nation's airports in four years."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/15/593895383/us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-russia-over-election-interference-cyberattacks","Updated at 12:12 p.m. ETThe Trump administration imposed new sanctions against Russia on Thursday, slapping punitive measures on 19 people and five entities over their alleged role in Moscow's interference in the 2016 election and other ""destructive"" cyberattacks.The sanctions mark the most significant move against Russia since President Trump took office more than a year ago. They arrived as Washington's closest ally, Britain, is locked in a diplomatic struggle with Moscow after accusing the Kremlin of using a nerve agent to poison a former Russian intelligence officer living in the United Kingdom.Trump also joined the leaders of the U.K., France and Germany on Thursday in issuing a statement that condemned the poisoning attack.Among the Russians sanctioned by the U.S. on Thursday are 13 people and three entities, including the Internet Research Agency, indicted by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller for their alleged role in Moscow's influence operation during the 2016 campaign.Trump has repeatedly questioned whether Russia did indeed interfere in the election, despite the assessment of U.S. intelligence agencies that the Kremlin carried out a sweeping influence operation and propaganda campaign.Lately, however, he has changed his tune and accepted that the active measures took place. Last week, he vowed to ""counteract very strongly"" any interference in this year's midterm races.Two Russian intelligence agencies — the domestic-focused Federal Security Service, or FSB, and Russia's chief military intelligence organization, the GRU — also were hit with sanctions along with six senior GRU officials. Several of those individuals already faced U.S. sanctions.Sanctions against the government agencies are mostly symbolic and are not expected to seriously constrain the campaign of active measures against the West.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, however, that the point is to continue pressuring and isolating Russia over its agitation against the West.""The administration is confronting and countering malign Russian cyberactivity, including their attempted interference in U.S. elections, destructive cyberattacks, and intrusions targeting critical infrastructure,"" Mnuchin said.""These targeted sanctions are part of a broader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia.""Among the cyberattacks for which U.S. is trying to punish Russia was the ""NotPetya"" attack, which targeted computers in Ukraine. The U.S. attributes that attack to the Russian military.Mnuchin said the administration plans to impose more sanctions in an effort ""to hold Russian government officials and oligarchs accountable for their destabilizing activities by severing their access to the U.S. financial system.""Critics said the measures announced on Thursday were far too little, too late.""It took 14 months, multiple indictments, and a poisoning in Britain — but the administration is finally imposing the sanctions overwhelmingly approved by Congress,"" said Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.""However, sanctions alone are insufficient. Now we must protect our democracy going forward by securing our election systems and increasing transparency and disclosure requirements for online political advertisements.""Administration officials say they're doing that. The Department of Homeland Security and FBI are working with state-level elections officials to familiarize them with the cyberthreats from abroad.But the potential peril is broader than ever. National security officials told reporters on Thursday that cyberattackers also have focused on American critical infrastructure, including the electrical grid and key industrial facilities.""The cyber actors are using a multistage attack campaign with staging and intended targets involved,"" one official said. ""And the campaign is long term and still ongoing.""Foreign cyberattackers gain access to internal networks involved with running a power plant, for example. Then they map the way it works and burrow deeper.""After obtaining access, these actors conducted network reconnaissance, moved laterally and collected information pertaining to industrial control systems, the systems that run our factories and our grid.""An attack that crippled an American electrical system or another major industrial target would probably be viewed as a major act of war and could trigger an equal response.So it's not as likely as the lower-level interference that continues from Russia, but it remains part of the suite of weapons that nations could wield against one another in a crisis addition to their traditional military hardware."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/15/593921348/signs-point-to-trump-getting-tougher-on-china-over-trade","For all his harsh rhetoric about unfair trade practices by China, President Trump stopped short of taking any punitive actions against Beijing during his first year in office.But that may be about to change.The Trump administration is expected to release the results of a seven-month investigation into Chinese trade practices, under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, a move that could lead to sanctions against the country and provoke retaliation by Beijing.The actions could come within days, according to a source within the administration.""The Trump administration has made it very clear that it believes that it has the authority under Section 301 to threaten and/or impose tariffs on China directly over these practices,"" says Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.Section 301 gives the president wide latitude to impose penalties such as reciprocal bans on cross-border investments and tariffs on a wide variety of Chinese goods, Alden says.The U.S. also could band together with allies to force China's hand at the World Trade Organization. Countries in Asia, Latin America and Europe have long complained that Chinese trade practices such as forced transfers of technology, illegal government subsidies and dumping of low-cost exports weaken competitors.Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro, a staunch China critic, says, ""I think there's a widespread and growing consensus around the world that China is not playing by the rules and that together we as allies and trading partners need to take many, many different kinds of measures to ensure a level playing field.""Trump has been excoriating China for years, accusing it of blocking access to its markets for foreign companies.Once in office, he has been slower to match his rhetoric with actions. His administration failed to label China a currency manipulator, even though Trump promised to do so during the campaign.He may have hesitated in part because he needed Beijing's help with North Korea, and because the prospect of a trade war scares U.S. companies such as Boeing, which earn a lot of money in China.But a clash seems almost inevitable, given China's outsize role in global trade.  The U.S. recently imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The vast increase in production of the two metals by China in recent years has helped lower their price globally and hurt U.S. producers, the U.S. says.  ""If you're concerned about the large U.S. trade deficit, which the president is and has said he is repeatedly, most of that's a China problem,"" says Alden, of the Council on Foreign Relations.In December, the administration released its national security strategy, which for the first time labeled China an ""economic aggressor,"" Navarro noted.The paper said, ""We will work with our partners to contest China's unfair trade and economic practices and restrict its acquisition of sensitive technologies.""Still, any move to punish China carries risks for the United States and the world as a whole.The countries of the world have spent decades carefully crafting laws meant to regulate the flow of trade, notes Dan Ikenson, director of the Cato Institute's Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies. Disputes between nations are meant to be settled at the World Trade Organization.If the U.S. opts to act on its own, it could undermine the infrastructure of global trade in a way that causes more problems than it solves, Ikenson says.""My main concern is that we actually go forward with these unilateral duties, and the rest of the world sees the United States as disavowing the WTO, China retaliates and so the costs start to spread across the U.S. economy,"" he says.While China has sometimes shown it's willing to change some of its more egregious trade practices, it's also made clear it will go at its own pace.Too much pressure from Washington is likely to be seen as bullying by Beijing and could invite retaliation against U.S. companies.But after lobbing so much criticism at China over the years, Trump may feel he has little choice but to take action of some kind.As Navarro sees it, such action has been a long time coming.""It's staggering — staggering — what China does in terms of cheating the international system, and it's refreshing that we finally have a president that is standing up for all the American people and standing up to China on all this,"" he says."

It's four stories high, made of concrete and shares a small parking lot with the apartment building next door.But if you look a little closer, a few details stick out. For instance, the building is covered in windows, but each one is blocked by heavy drapes. And there are security cameras all over the building.That's what you can see from the outside. But what went on inside this building in 2015 has attracted a lot of attention in both U.S. and Russian media. The company that operated inside 55 Savushkina was called the Internet Research Agency. But unofficially, and more commonly, it was known as the ""troll factory.""Hundreds worked here, and 13 people, including a man with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, were recently named in an indictment connected to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has been sanctioned by the U.S. for providing support to the Russian Defense Ministry as it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, is alleged to be the man who funded the troll factory.Internet activist Lyudmila Savchuk spent two months working undercover at the troll factory in 2015, creating fake social media accounts and writing blog posts meant to sow divisions in the U.S. and turn Russians against Americans.Savchuk, a slight woman in her mid-30s, carries around a laptop with a campaign sticker for Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader in Russia who has been barred from running in the presidential election this weekend.She sips a latte in a cafe outside St. Petersburg after dropping her kids off at day care for the afternoon.""The factory worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There was a day shift, a night shift, and even shifts over the holidays. The factory worked every single second,"" Savchuk says.In the early days of her investigation into how fake social media accounts and trolls were affecting society, she was looking for a way in. It was late 2014 and she kept seeing advertisements in her social media feed geared to young, educated Russians looking to work in a creative field. A friend who worked at the troll factory tipped her off to what the ads were for. That same friend put in a good word for Savchuk with her bosses.""My friend taught me the ropes. She told me that I had to write posts that were natural — like, for example, 'I am cooking or I am walking down the street and I had this thought about how bad the [pro-Western] Ukrainian president is.' ""According to Savchuk, there were a few hundred people in the building at any given time, and the average pay started at $400 a month. The trolls were divided into groups. Those with the best English skills posed as Americans and created accounts on Facebook and Twitter. They'd use those troll accounts to stir up trouble on subjects such as U.S. elections or race relations.Savchuk, who considers herself a freelance investigative journalist and activist for free and fair elections, spent most of her time at the troll farm writing as an imaginary Russian woman on the LiveJournal blogging platform, widely used in Russia today. Her posts were meant for Russian readers and were intended to inflame anti-American feelings.""We made up a post about a new computer game created in the States — that even kids loved to play — and the theme of the game was slavery,"" she says. ""And this was to stir negative tensions towards Americans, as the creators of this game.""That game never existed. Nor did the woman that Savchuk was posing as. A day at the troll factory could mean multiple layers of trolling subterfuge.Each troll was given a list of topics to focus on by a supervisor. She says there were usually about 10 topics on the list. The United States, the European Union and Putin never left the list.""It is laughable when Putin says that we do not know about trolls or trolls do not exist,"" she says, ""because when anyone looks thorough the Kremlin-controlled newspapers or state TV, they can see that the propaganda in that media is the exact same stuff that the trolls are posting.""Savchuk worries about the deleterious effect of so much fake information on Russian society.""For the public, it is harmful because we are being brainwashed,"" she says.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/15/593844812/trump-admits-to-making-up-trade-deficit-in-talks-with-canadian-prime-minister","Updated at 4:43 p.m.In audio of a closed-door fundraiser obtained by the Washington Post and NBC News, President Trump boasts to donors that he ""had no idea"" whether he was correct when he insisted to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada. It doesn't. In fact, according to the U.S. Trade Representative in 2016, the U.S. had a $12.5 billion goods and services trade surplus with Canada. Trump sometimes ignores trade in services, which pumps up trade deficit numbers, but that isn't an accurate way to look at the U.S. trade relationship with other countries. As she tried to explain why Trump had been right all along, Press Secretary Sarah Sanders cited trade in goods alone, leaving out trade in services. Services make up a significantly larger share of the US economy than goods production. And it isn't clear from Trump's remarks whether that is really what he was talking about.Trump was in the midst of a 30-minute speech at a fundraiser in St. Louis on Wednesday when, according to the Washington Post write-up, he riffed on a conversation he'd had with Trudeau. This caught-on-tape moment comes less than a week after Trump signed proclamations putting stiff tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Those tariffs won't immediately apply to Canada and Mexico, as those countries are in the midst of renegotiating, along with the U.S., the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Based on other comments, Trump is planning to leverage the threat of tariffs to negotiate better trade terms with U.S. trading partners.  It's not clear how this admission that the president contradicted another world leader without basis will affect future negotiations or relationships with Trudeau and other leaders. A failure to agree on basic facts would seem to make such negotiations more difficult. Asked by reporters during a photo opportunity in the Oval Office whether he has always been truthful with Trudeau, Trump ignored the question.But he is standing by his assertion that the U.S. has a trade deficit with Canada, tweeting Thursday morning, ""P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn't like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating), but they do...they almost all do...and that's how I know!""Canada is America's second-largest goods trading partner, according to U.S. data. Trade with Canada supported some 1.6 million jobs in the U.S., according to 2015 Commerce Department figures. A spokeswoman for the Canadian government declined to comment on Trump's remarks and directed NPR to a tweet from the Canadian ambassador to the U.S., David MacNaughton, who cited the same American figures. This is far from the first time Trump has inaccurately described the trade relationship with America's neighbor to the north.In a December New York Times interview, Trump claimed that ""[We lost] $17 billion with Canada — Canada says we broke even. But they don't include lumber and they don't include oil. Oh, that's not. ... [Inaudible] ... My friend Justin [Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister] he says, 'No, no, we break even.' I said, 'Yeah, but you're not including oil, and you're not including lumber.' When you do, you lose $17 billion, and with the other one, we're losing $71 billion."" NPR's Domenico Montanaro fact-checked this at the time. It is entirely unclear where Trump got his numbers. In a recent paper, Canada-based researchers said that if energy exports are excluded, the country runs a $78 billion manufacturing trade deficit with the United States. "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/15/593745542/long-divided-federal-election-commission-unites-on-digital-ad-transparency","The Federal Election Commission, better known for deadlocks than decisions, has unanimously agreed to take a first step against anonymous political advertising on the internet.The proposed rule deals with disclaimers — the ""authorized by"" taglines that are mandatory in print, television and radio ads that explicitly support or attack candidates.The proposal would update FEC regulations dating back to 2006, when cutting-edge digital politicking involved buying ads on websites and blogs, mobile apps were just surfacing and internet-connected appliances were beyond the horizon. Those earlier regulations generally used the existing rules for radio and TV advertising.Now, with the commission under pressure to deal with digital ads, chair Caroline Hunter, a Republican, and vice chair Ellen Weintraub, a Democrat, negotiated a compromise that blends provisions from both sides into a single proposed rule.The proposal will be shaped through public comments over 60 days, and a June 27 public hearing. The commission expects to get comments from social media companies that would have to comply with the new rule, and from other experts.""We're open to possibilities that aren't even in this document,"" Hunter said.Digital media consume increasing amounts of political advertising. In 2012, when President Barack Obama ran for re-election, digital political spending totaled $159 million, the FEC says. Four years later, when President Trump was running, the total was $1.4 billion.Although the FEC is acting after Russian trolls spread advertisements through social media during the 2016 presidential election, the proposed rule wouldn't have touched most of those ads. Disclaimers are required only for ""express advocacy"" messages that attack or support candidates. The Russian ads were not that direct, and many focused on issues without mentioning the candidates."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/15/593576455/house-intel-republicans-have-cleared-trump-so-are-the-russia-investigations-over","The House intelligence committee has completed its ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" story about the Russia imbroglio. Republicans wrote a happy ending for President Trump. Democrats wrote a cliffhanger.Even though members of the committee say they're taking separate ramps off this highway, however, the road goes ever on. Here are 4 more mileposts still to come in the remainder of the Russia imbroglio.Democrats are already unhappy with it, but the leaders of the House intelligence committee say their report is complete. It could land with a thud: It's more than 150 pages, includes more than 40 findings and makes 25 recommendations.For now, though, it's still secret. First, Democrats in the committee's minority need to ""review"" it — although they've already made clear how they feel — and then it must be declassified by the intelligence community before it can become public.Will it include any new information? The House committee's dueling Republican and Democratic memoranda in February both shed new factual light on the Russia story, even though they were both partisan documents.Republicans' memo focused heavily on the facts involved with what they call abuse of power by the FBI and Justice Department, revealing, for example, that the author of the infamous, unverified Russia dossier was a Never-Trumper.Democrats countered in their memo by revealing that some of the dossier was, in fact, verified by the FBI, and that more people in the Trump camp were under investigation than previously known — though all those details remain secret.Will the chairman of the House intelligence committee, Devin Nunes, R-Calif., break more new ground in his report or simply make an argument exonerating Trump based on what's already public?The Senate intelligence committee and Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller, however, aren't quitting yet — of which more below. So Nunes' strategy boils down to a bet on time: He has cleared Trump, but how many revelations could still be coming that he doesn't know he doesn't know about?One basic point of contention between Republicans and Democrats is over interpreting the facts in the Russia case. Republicans say, in effect, nothing in evidence today shows that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government's attack on the 2016 election or did anything wrong.Contacts that took place between Trump aides and Russians before and after Election Day showed, at worst, bad judgment by the Americans involved, said Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, — not an international conspiracy.Democrats argue that's not only not so — they believe the evidence does show collusion — but that Republicans won't do the kind of investigation that would uncover new facts they don't want. House intelligence committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., listed several witnesses he said the Republican majority wouldn't interview, the subpoenas it won't issue and the documents it won't use its power to obtain.Republicans, in short, want to fight on the political battlefield in its present condition, build a firebreak and then move on to what they call the next phase of the story: safeguarding future elections.That was the line House Speaker Paul Ryan's office took after Nunes' announcement:""After more than a year investigating Russia's actions in the 2016 election, we are well into the primary season for the 2018 elections and experts are warning that we need to safeguard against further interference,"" said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. ""That's what this next phase is about and we hope Democrats will join us in seeing this through.""House intelligence committee Republicans' decision to wrap up their Russia investigation puts subtle pressure on their colleagues in the other chamber. The relationship between the two committees is, if not broken, badly damaged after complaints of leaks and counter-leaks about their work on the Russia case.Now Republicans on the House side of the Capitol are in a position to say: We've done our work. What's taking you so long?Senate intelligence committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., has tried to keep his panel inside the guardrails and his working relationship cordial with Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., — a mirror image of the partisan corrosion on the House side.But they still have letters after their names and contrasting incentives in the same way every member of Congress does. Navigating those dynamics is just as fraught, although it plays out in a more senatorial and clandestine fashion.""I have said publicly — and been criticized for it — that our committee was created to operate in secrecy,"" Burr said last month. ""I believe that's where we perform our best work.""People familiar with the Senate committee's internal workings have questioned whether it will be able to conclude its work with a single report, or whether its work product might also fission apart in the way the House intelligence committee has.That may depend on how different its findings are from the House and whether its slower and more bipartisan approach yields facts that could change the political state of play that Nunes and his compatriots have embraced.Facets of the executive branch are also at work on studies about the Russian attack on the 2016 election and how to defend the electoral system this year and beyond:What isn't clear is what will ultimately issue from all this work. The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI have already begun working with state elections officials about cyber-threats and security. Will there be a major new official report from within the Trump administration, or perhaps more than one?If Nunes' vision of the Russia story is correct, all the evidence that exists is all there will be. That may mean Trump and his advisers feel more confident about discussing the general issue of election interference — and that could bring about another new phase in the Russia story.There have already been some indications that a page has turned, as when Trump said last week that he isn't concerned about Russian influence on the 2018 midterms.""We'll counteract whatever they do,"" the president said. ""We'll counteract it very strongly.""Special counsel Robert Mueller is the joker in this pack. No one truly knows what's up his sleeve except him and his team. So far he has charged a number of Americans and Russians — or concluded guilty pleas about lying to the FBI — but accused no Trump aides with conspiring directly with the Russian interference.If that stands, it'll be a boost for the White House many times greater than the one it got from House intelligence committee Republicans this week.If it changes and people within the Trump orbit do face indictment over alleged conspiracy with the active measures, the work of Nunes and his colleagues this week would be badly undercut."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/14/593491529/the-result-in-the-pa-special-election-could-mean-trouble-for-republicans","Updated at 3:50 p.m. ETDemocrat Conor Lamb appears to have won the special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, defeating Republican Rick Saccone in an upset for President Trump and congressional Republicans, based on a review of the vote by member station WESA and barring a recount.That a Democrat is even close in this Western Pennsylvania congressional district can mean only one thing — bad news for Republicans in this midterm year.""We should be able to elect a box of hammers in this district,"" veteran Republican strategist Mike Murphy told the Washington Post's Robert Costa. ""If we're losing here, you can bet there is a Democratic wave coming.""Why the alarm bells?Consider: Not only is this a district President Trump won by about 20 points in November 2016, as plenty have pointed out, but there are 118 Republicans sitting in seats Trump won by less than the 18th Congressional District in Pennsylvania. Democrats need to flip a net of 24 seats to take back control of the House.It's important to not overread the results of any special election, but the result — no matter which way it goes in the end — raises questions about the Trump coalition and how much it transfers to the Republican Party broadly; the GOP's messaging on everything from continuing to use House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi as a cudgel to the tax bill; and whether Republicans can hold off a Democratic wave given that this result was yet another example of Democrats' holding on to the enthusiasm advantage.Where the race goes from hereMember station WESA has reviewed current vote counts from all of the individual counties in the district. That count shows Lamb with a lead of 627 votes. Between provisional ballots, absentee ballots and military/residents overseas ballots still outstanding, there are only 618 votes left to count based on the latest numbers. That gives Lamb an insurmountable lead.This is barring the potential for a protest recount, which would be based on evidence of voter fraud or errors in counting. Pennsylvania law does not provide for an automatic recount in congressional races.There is no timeline for certification of the race at this point, according to the Pennsylvania secretary of state's office.A recount is an outside possibility at this point. One would be triggered if three people in each precinct come forward with evidence of voter fraud or counting errors. Loosely, they have until the middle of next week to do that.Warning signs for GOP that the Trump coalition may not be transferableWhite, working-class voters were key to Trump's presidential victory — and there are plenty of them in this district.Trump won whites with some or no college education by 39 points, a wider margin than any candidate since at least 1980.There are no exit polls to know for sure how this group voted Tuesday, but Lamb made clear appeals to them — and it would be impossible to make up a 20-point gap without at least some crossover. In fact, dozens of precincts went more Democratic than in the 2016 election.Lamb also benefited from Saccone's history of supporting ""right to work"" legislation in the state Legislature. The district has a sizable number of union households that might have been willing to support a different Republican candidate, but unions and the Lamb campaign were able to define Saccone as anti-union.Also, turnout was pretty high, especially for a special election in March. It was so high, in fact, more people voted than in the gubernatorial general election during the last midterm in 2014.What's more, the approximately 228,000 people who went to the polls were 78 percent of the approximately 294,000 cast for Republican Rep. Tim Murphy. Murphy ran unopposed in 2016 but resigned last October amid a sex scandal, which set this special election in motion.Republicans spent some $10 million to try to hold this district (that won't even exist in nine months because of the maps' being redrawn by the state Supreme Court) and turn out their voters. But despite the relatively high turnout, Saccone got only about 113,000 votes (the same as Lamb) — less than 40 percent of Murphy's total in 2016.Trump made an eleventh-hour visit this past weekend to try to help Saccone over the line.""I think the president helped close this race,"" House Speaker Paul Ryan contended Wednesday, per NPR's Susan Davis.But that does not appear to have been enough.The Pelosi factor and the tax bill messagingDoes this win for Democrats mean they will start to abandon Pelosi? It very well might, but it depends on the district. A couple of things to look at:To which Ryan had this to say: ""This is something that you're not going to see repeated, because they [Democrats] didn't have a primary. They were able to pick a candidate who could run as a conservative, who ran against the minority leader, who ran on a conservative agenda. You will have primaries in all these other races, and the primaries bring them to the left. So I just don't think this is something they're going to be able to see a repeat of.""But it provides a road map for Democrats in these very kinds of districts if they want to win. That has to be worrying for Republicans.It also does raise the question of what Democrats do about Pelosi. If they win the House back in large measure by running against Pelosi, can they really then turn around and re-elect her speaker this fall? And there's the question of whether enough Democratic candidates will vow not to support her for speaker that she can't get elected.The suburbs and making inroads in rural areasFifty-two percent of Lamb's vote came from the suburban precincts in Allegheny County outside Pittsburgh.If Democrats are going to win back the House, their road goes through the suburbs. Nationally, in 2016, Trump won the suburbs with 49 percent. In 2012, Mitt Romney got 50 percent in them. So that's key.Lamb won only a handful of precincts in the other three more rural counties in this district, but dozens of precincts went more Democratic than in the 2016 presidential election for Trump.In other words, Lamb was able to cut into Republican margins — and when every vote counts, as in a race like this, it can make all the difference.NPR's Arnie Seipel contributed to this report."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/14/593634549/who-is-conor-lamb-apparent-winner-of-pennsylvania-special-election","Just five months ago, almost no one in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District knew Conor Lamb's name.But since quitting his job as a federal prosecutor to run for a vacant House seat, the 33-year-old has spent a lot of time introducing himself to people. Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald says that's exactly what he had to do — particularly as a Democrat in Trump country.""You gotta show up and talk to people. Conor's been to every fish fry, every VFW, every American Legion, senior center, doors,"" Fitzgerald told NPR's Scott Detrow. ""He's been relating to people. And that's really what it takes for Democrats to get away from just urban areas and get out into the smaller towns and compete."" And compete he did.Lamb is the apparent winner of the contest for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, according to an analysis by public radio station WESA. The race has not been officially called, but a review of the votes indicates that Lamb has an insurmountable lead over Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone.Lamb's victory would be a huge win for Democrats, and a major blow to President Trump. Trump won this district by 20 points in 2016, and Republican Tim Murphy — who resigned in October after a report that he had encouraged a woman with whom he had an affair to get an abortion — won his last eight elections easily.But Lamb seems to have overcome that Republican advantage in this largely white, working-class district by touting his bio — a Marine Corps veteran, former prosecutor, Catholic; and his more conservative positions — on guns, abortion, crime.His first TV ad highlights the fact that he grew up in the district. In the same town, in fact, where he now lives — Mount Lebanon, a suburb south of Pittsburgh. He graduated from Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 2002, earned both his undergraduate and law degrees at the University of Pennsylvania, and worked as a prosecutor in the Marine Corps — first in Okinawa, Japan, and then for the Navy-Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals.After leaving active duty in 2013 and joining the Reserves, Lamb was appointed an assistant U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh. There, his bio says, he ""led prosecutions against drug dealers and violent criminals and helped establish the Justice Department's Pittsburgh office as a national leader in the fight against the heroin epidemic, working to build partnerships between law enforcement and community members in places that have been hit hardest by the crisis."" Lamb stepped down from the U.S. Attorney's Office last fall, shortly after Murphy resigned his seat. Though this is his first run for office, Lamb comes from a family that has been active in state and local politics. His uncle is Pittsburgh Controller Michael Lamb; and his grandfather Thomas Lamb was a state representative, the Democratic majority leader in the state Senate in the 1970s and secretary of legislative affairs for Gov. Robert Casey.Unlike his Republican opponent — who billed himself as ""Trump before Trump was Trump"" — Lamb stayed away from making the race about the president or partisan politics. ""The biggest issues facing the 18th Congressional District aren't partisan,"" his campaign website reads. ""Heroin kills both Democrats and Republicans. Health care is too expensive. The roads and bridges we all use are crumbling. But the people we send to Washington aren't solving these problems. I'm running for Congress because it's time for that to change."" On the campaign trail, Lamb highlighted his work fighting the opioid crisis — which has hit the region hard — as well as his support for unions. In a district with 86,000 union households, union endorsement was key to his success. At a rally Sunday night, United Mine Workers of America President Cecil Roberts came out hard for Lamb, calling him ""a God-fearing, union-supporting, gun-owning, job-protecting, pension-defending, Social Security-believing, health care-creating and sending-drug-dealers-to-jail Democrat.""If certified as the winner, Lamb will serve out the rest of the year in the House, representing PA-18. But the district as it is now will cease to exist at the end of the year because of court-ordered redistricting in Pennsylvania. So if Lamb wants to stay in the House after 2018, he will have to run again — in a district that is likely to look different from the one he just won.Samantha Fields is the producer of the NPR Politics Podcast."

McCabe is expected to collect a pension based on his nearly 22 years of service with the bureau.It isn't clear what Sessions will decide.McCabe briefly served as acting director of the bureau after James Comey was fired in May.McCabe abruptly left his active role as deputy FBI director in late January 2018 after the new FBI director, Christopher Wray, received a briefing about the forthcoming Justice Department Inspector General report and its findings about McCabe.DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores offered this statement:""The department follows a prescribed process by which an employee may be terminated. That process includes recommendations from career employees, and no termination decision is final until the conclusion of that process. We have no personnel announcements at this time.""McCabe has been the subject of political attacks by President Trump and Republican supporters since the 2016 presidential campaign. McCabe's wife, Jill, ran for the state Legislature in Virginia as a Democrat and accepted campaign contributions via then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton loyalist.Jill McCabe lost her election, and the FBI and Justice Department said she and Andrew observed the relevant ethics requirements. But Trump and his allies called it an obvious conflict of interest.Opponents have also pointed to references to McCabe in text messages between two senior FBI employees that criticized Trump and have embarrassed the bureau. Taken together, the threads have formed part of a concerted attack on what critics call ""bias"" within Justice and the FBI against Trump."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/14/593590830/5-cabinet-secretaries-push-trump-infrastructure-plan-before-congress","The Trump administration sent an all-star team of five Cabinet secretaries to a Senate hearing Wednesday to talk up its infrastructure proposals. But not even the combined talents of the secretaries of Transportation, Commerce, Labor, Agriculture and Energy seemed enough to move the ball on the $1.5 trillion plan, and it remains unclear whether the measure will ever find its way to a vote in the House or Senate.Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee chairman John Thune, R-S.D., said he was hopeful that ""both sides can come together on this and it can happen this year.""But several unanswered questions remain, chief among them where the $200 billion in federal funding would come from and where states would find the remainder of the money.The Trump plan commits $200 billion in federal funding over 10 years to stimulate state and local spending and private investment. Half of the funding, $100 billion, would be used as incentives to entice cities, counties and states to raise at least 80 percent of the infrastructure costs themselves.That's a departure from the way many projects are funded now. Funding for federal-aid highways, including interstates, is usually allocated in an 80-20 federal-state split. So, President Trump's plan would flip that funding burden. Major mass transit projects are often funded on a 50-50 federal-local basis. Again, the administration's plan puts a much greater burden on local taxpayers and users.Estimates vary but the American Society of Civil Engineers has opined that there is a $2 trillion investment gap when it comes to the country's infrastructure needs.""How are you gonna get members of the Senate to vote for the tax revenue in order to pay for these plans?,"" asked Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the ranking Democrat on the panel. ""We can't toll our way out,"" he said. Nelson suggested that the recently-enacted tax cut be changed from a 21-percent corporate rate to 25 percent to pay for infrastructure, a non-starter as far as most Republicans are concerned.Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said that with some estimates as high as $4 trillion to repair the nation's roads, bridges, ports and airports, ""We cannot address a challenge of this magnitude with federal resources alone, or by borrowing."" She said the administration was ""agnostic"" about where the state share of the funds would come from, but said the federal government only owns 10 percent of the nation's roads and bridges, implying it was up to state and local governments to figure out where to find the funds to finance their share of improvements.Several states have already raised their gas taxes to fund road repairs, and others have instituted new tolls.Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., said Congress and the administration have ""got the identification of the problem down cold,"" adding the challenge is ""how we're going to pay for it."" The administration's plan, he said was ""just smoke and mirrors.""Addressing criticism that the administration only released an outline of what it hopes to see in an infrastructure plan, Chao said the administration sent Congress a list of principles rather than specific legislation in ""an open show of cooperation."" She said the administration wants to work with Congress ""and not be prescriptive"" with specific legislative language.One of the key principles for the administration, said Energy Secretary Rick Perry, was removing regulatory barriers to speed approval of construction projects. Perry called the current permitting process fractured and redundant, saying ""it requires projects to navigate a huge maze of federal regulations."" Perry said Trump wants to see the process streamlined and ""substantially cut back.""Wednesday morning, the president tweeted thanking the Senate committee for helping with his effort to improve the nation's infrastructure. The president wrote that the nation's infrastructure was ""crumbling,"" and said ""We need to build FAST & we need to build for our FUTURE."""

""We will work to have an orderly transition and will keep everyone posted on the timing of him officially assuming the role.""A longtime free-markets conservative who worked on Wall Street, Kudlow supports most traditional Republican fiscal policies, which may quiet concerns among congressional Republicans and investors that the president will surround himself with trade protectionists.Kudlow has known Trump for years and advised him on policy matters during the 2016 campaign. He largely supports the president's agenda and has been a big advocate of his tax cuts.""Trump and the GOP are on the side of the growth angels with the passage of powerful tax-cut legislation to boost business investment, wages, and take-home family pay,"" Kudlow wrote after the Republican tax bill passed in December.But he has criticized Trump's trade policies. For example, he recently said any move to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement would be a ""calamitously bad decision.""Like Cohn, he also opposed the steel and aluminum tariffs announced earlier this month, telling CNBC: ""In the Reagan years, we used to call the free traders the 'white hats' and the protectionists the 'black hats.' The black hats won this time around and I'm very sorry, because it will damage the economy to some extent.""Kudlow told The Wall Street Journal he had voiced his concerns to the president and was encouraged by Trump's decision to exempt Canada, Mexico and Australia from the tariffs.""He said to me several times, 'I believe in global trade. I regard myself as a global trader, but it has to be fair trade to protect America,' "" Kudlow told the Journal. ""I'm on board with that. I personally hope widespread tariff use — it doesn't come to that. But in some cases, it will.""On his recent podcast, Kudlow noted: ""Mr. Trump has a negotiating style that is very interesting to me. He comes at you — like he's going to punch you in the teeth with all these tariffs. But then he pulls back and starts making, you know, negotiating deals that can work. That looks to me like, you know, that's his art of the deal. It's in his book. That looks to me like what he's doing here on tariffs. He comes out really hard and strong. Scares everybody. But then he starts to pull back and withdraw.""Kudlow does not have an economics degree. After serving in the White House Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, he was hired as chief economist at Bear Stearns. But he was forced out amid struggles with drug use, a problem he has spoken about publicly.Since then he has been a regular commentator and host on CNBC and has written often on economic matters. But he was criticized for repeatedly downplaying the economy's troubles in the months leading up to the Great Recession.""There ain't no recession,"" he wrote in December 2007. ""The Bush boom is alive and well.""Kudlow also warned that subsequent Federal Reserve policies aimed at stimulating the economy would lead to higher inflation, which didn't happen."

The Republican-led Congress followed up with its own torture ban in a 2015 law. The Army Field Manual spells out which types of interrogation are permitted, and waterboarding is not among them.The likely debateStill, that doesn't mean the discussion is over. Not by a long shot.""The debate that will occur around the Haspel nomination may help clear the air by putting these issues before the public,"" said John Prados, a senior fellow at the National Security Archive, a nonprofit in Washington that advocates for government openness.However, if Haspel and the CIA are not forthcoming, it could create a new backlash, he warned.""I believe the agency is mistaken if it thinks it can escape from what happened here,"" added Prados, a frequent critic of the agency and the author of The Ghosts of Langley: Into The CIA's Heart Of Darkness.John Rizzo, who was the CIA's acting general counsel in the period after the Sept. 11 attacks, also believes a renewed discussion could be helpful.""Now, with the benefit of time, I think the country would be well-served by a reasoned, non-emotional discussion about whether any kind of interrogation technique, beyond a standard Q&A, is ever justifiable — or effective, for that matter,"" Rizzo told NPR's Morning Edition.However, Rizzo, who said he has known Haspel since the 1990s, remains a supporter of the tough interrogation methods.""I have some regrets, but I still continue to believe the program was effective,"" he said. ""I have a strong feeling that the information in question — and there was a lot of it — would not have come nearly as quickly without resorting to aggressive measures.""He does not think those measure amounted to torture.""I do not believe that the word 'torture' was and is legally accurate,"" he said. ""There were very harsh, very brutal methods. But not torture.""Trump's campaign commentsLegally speaking, an attempt to resume waterboarding or other similarly harsh techniques would require new legislation reversing the measures put in place in recent years, legal scholars say. In practical political terms, any technique that amounts to torture is certain to provoke a firestorm of criticism.Trump raised the issue during the 2016 presidential campaign, saying, ""I would bring back waterboarding, and I would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.""During the first days of the Trump administration in January 2017, McCain said: ""The president can sign whatever executive orders he likes. But the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the United States of America.""In addition, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other current and former officials in the military and intelligence communities have spoken out against waterboarding.An undercover careerHaspel was an undercover CIA officer for three decades and therefore has no public record. Some Democratic senators objected when she was named the CIA's deputy director a year ago, but that position did not require Senate confirmation.In addition to overseeing a black site prison in 2002, she was deeply involved in the 2005 decision to destroy videotapes of the waterboarding sessions. That action came after Congress had learned of the videos and called on them to be preserved.The Justice Department spent years investigating alleged abuses in the interrogation program, but no one was ever charged with a crime. Haspel's supporters say that she and others involved were asked to do a tough job and were given assurances that their actions were legal.""People in the prosecution of their duties inside government take on a great burden,"" said Danielle Pletka of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""They do not deserve to be indicted on Twitter or by WikiLeaks or in the press before they get a hearing.""For a time, Haspel was the chief of base at the black site prison in Thailand where some al-Qaida suspects were interrogated after the Sept. 11 attacks. One big question is whether evidence obtained during their interrogations will be admissible at a trial.Greg Myre is a national security correspondent. Follow him @gregmyre1.Editor's note on March 16: In a previous version of this story, there was a reference to Gina Haspel's presence ""at a black site prison in Thailand"" where two al-Qaida suspects, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, were interrogated. According to several media reports, including from ProPublica, she was ""chief of base"" at that site starting in 2002. But this week, ProPublica issued a retraction, a correction and an apology for some of its reporting on that point. It now says that Haspel was not in charge of that black site at the time of Zubaydah's interrogations and had not mocked his complaints about the treatment."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/14/593259946/after-mishandling-parkland-shooter-tip-fbi-to-answer-questions-from-congress","Updated at 3:30 p.m. ETAs students staged a national walkout Wednesday morning over gun violence, senior federal officials sat down for a grilling from Congress over law enforcement's failure to act on tips about the suspect in last month's school shooting in Parkland, Fla.The massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School touched off yet another round of soul-searching and national debate over guns in the U.S. that has drawn in activists, lawmakers and the White House. One major change this time, however, is that Florida teenagers who survived the violence are spearheading the conversation.The Senate Judiciary Committee officially joined the discussion Wednesday with a hearing that opened with Florida's senators begging their congressional colleagues to act.""We've had our fill of this in Florida the last two years,"" said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., before he listed the many mass shootings the state has endured, including the Pulse nightclub massacre in June 2016 that killed 49 people.Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., raised his voice as he noted that the alleged Parkland shooter, Nikolas Cruz, ""didn't slip through one crack, he slipped through every crack.""""This tragedy was the result of two things: the first is of a multi-systemic failure of government agencies at the federal, state and local levels,"" said Rubio. ""And second because of vulnerabilities in our existing laws that need to be addressed.""Questions about the FBI's actions fell to acting FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich, who testified alongside the acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Thomas Brandon, and the head of the National Threat Assessment Center, Lina Alathari.Bowdich walked senators through the timeline of when the FBI knew what about Cruz and the potential threat he posed.In September 2017, Bowdich said, the FBI received an email tip about someone posting on YouTube under the name Nikolas Cruz: ""I'm going to be a professional school shooter.""And then in January, the bureau's tip line received a call from a close friend of Cruz's family warning that he had made statements about harming himself and others. The caller said they were concerned about him ""shooting up a school,"" Bowdich said.The FBI operator who took the phone call found the YouTube comment thread and consulted her supervisor. After that, however, the investigation was closed without any information being forwarded to any FBI field offices or any state or local law enforcement agencies.After questions from senators, Bowdich said the nature of the conversation between the operator and her supervisor remained unclear because the they gave differing accounts.""This is not the kind of news I want to deliver to this committee, to the families, or to the public, but we are committed to transparency in all that we do on behalf of the American people,"" Bowdich said. ""When we make mistakes, we will not hide from them.""Bowdich said the FBI is conducting a full-scale review of the tip line, which he said received some 765,000 calls, and 735,000 emails, last year.Local law enforcement also reportedly missed red flags. The Broward Sheriff's Office also received a tip about Cruz potentially being a ""school shooter in the making,"" according to the Miami Herald. The newspaper says deputies didn't report the warning.Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said he was frustrated that representatives from the sheriff's office declined to testify on Wednesday.Ryan Petty, whose daughter Alaina died in the shooting, and a teacher at the high school, Katherine Posada, also gave statements and took questions as part of the hearing.Petty asked the lawmakers to put aside the basic divisiveness of broad gun control measures, to focus on specific common-sense reforms. Two weeks ago, Senate Republicans decided not to vote on gun legislation that would have changed the background check system for most gun purchases.""Americans are deeply interested in safe schools, in caring communities and in secure neighborhoods. As the family of one of the victims, we've learned at great personal cost that Americans can come together,"" Petty said. ""We do not have to all agree on guns, and we won't. But we can agree on the most fundamental things.""When asked by Grassley what Congress could do to honor his daughter's memory and legacy, Petty answered simply: Make sure ""that this never happens again."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/14/593205855/tillerson-vs-pompeo-what-trumps-cabinet-shakeup-might-mean","Shortly after announcing a major shake-up on Twitter on Tuesday, President Trump told reporters, ""We're getting very close to having the Cabinet and other things that I want.""Trump wished outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson well but said he expects a more simpatico relationship with Mike Pompeo, the current CIA director whom the president has tapped to be the nation's top diplomat.""We're always on the same wavelength,"" Trump said of Pompeo, whose confirmation hearing is expected in April. ""We have a very similar thought process.""A White House official said Trump was eager to make the switch in advance of upcoming talks with North Korea and ongoing trade negotiations. Here are some areas in which the change could make a difference.North KoreaTillerson was caught flat-footed last week when Trump abruptly accepted an invitation for face-to-face talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Tillerson, who was traveling in Africa, had told reporters just a day earlier that the U.S. was ""a long ways from negotiations"" with Pyongyang.Trump acknowledged he hadn't discussed the idea in advance with Tillerson. ""Rex wasn't, as you know, in this country,"" Trump told reporters on Tuesday. ""I made that decision by myself.""Pompeo defended the president's move but stressed the U.S. and its allies will continue to press North Korea in advance of any Trump-Kim summit.""This administration has its eyes wide open, and the whole time this conversation takes place, the pressure will continue to mount on North Korea,"" Pompeo told CBS. ""There is no relief in sight until the president gets the objective that he has set forth consistently during his entire time in office.""That objective is denuclearization. According to South Korean officials who met with Kim, the North Korean leader expressed a willingness to discuss it, though it's not clear exactly what that means.IranTrump has threatened to tear up the Iran nuclear deal, negotiated by the Obama administration and five other countries, although so far he has stopped short of doing so. The deal gives Iran relief from certain international economic sanctions in exchange for suspension of its outlaw nuclear program. Tillerson and other national security advisers have urged the president to move carefully in overturning the deal, arguing that despite Iran's other transgressions, the nuclear agreement is working.This was one of the key differences Trump cited in explaining Tillerson's dismissal.""We disagreed on things,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""When you look at the Iran deal, I think it's terrible. I guess he thought it was OK. I wanted to either break it or do something, and he felt a little bit differently.""Pompeo, like the president, has been a fierce critic of the Iran deal, saying it doesn't go far enough in dismantling Tehran's nuclear program and that it's not permanent.""President Trump is determined to prevent that from happening in North Korea,"" Pompeo told CBS. Trump's reluctance to live by the terms of the Iran agreement, however, may affect U.S. credibility in negotiations with Pyongyang.TradeTillerson's ouster comes just days after Trump fired the opening salvo in what critics warn could become a trade war. The former Exxon Mobil CEO was among the advisers who reportedly tried to stop the president from ordering steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.Pompeo defended the president in an interview with Fox News Sunday, especially with regard to China, which is widely blamed for the glut of steel and aluminum on the world market.""It was very clear that what the Chinese are doing, whether that'd be on trade or the theft of intellectual property or their continued advancement in East and South China Seas, this administration is prepared and engaged in pushing back against the Chinese threats so that we can have a good relationship with China in a way the world desperately needs,"" Pompeo said.ChemistryTrump told reporters Tuesday that he wished Tillerson well but conceded he and the former secretary of state often didn't see eye to eye. The president regularly undercut Tillerson, once tweeting that he was ""wasting his time"" in pursuing a diplomatic approach to North Korea.Tillerson, in turn, made little effort to hide his disdain for the president. He pointedly did not deny an NBC report last October that he had once called Trump a ""moron.""Pompeo, who often delivers the president's intelligence briefing in person, enjoys a better relationship with Trump.""For whatever reason, chemistry, whatever it is,"" Trump told reporters. ""Right from the beginning, from Day 1, I've gotten along well with Mike Pompeo.""Former CIA Director Michael Hayden suggests that Trump and Pompeo share a similar worldview, which has pluses and minuses.""I think having a secretary of state who's more compatible with the president, who sounds and thinks more like the president, will actually make some things easier for the administration,"" Hayden told Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""On the other hand, Secretary Tillerson was a counterweight to some of the instantaneous, spontaneous, instinctive decisions that the president was prone to make. And I think we're going to miss the counterweight."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/13/593248914/pennsylvania-special-election-down-to-the-wire-in-trump-country","Updated at 5:30 a.m. ET WednesdayVotes are still being tallied in Tuesday's special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District — and it appears nearly every single one will need to be counted.The race between Republican Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb is down to the wire for this seat deep in Trump country, with confidence at Lamb's campaign early in the night giving way to supporters holding their collective breath as the results tightened to a near tie through the evening.With all precincts reporting, The Associated Press says that the race is too close to call, with Lamb ahead of Saccone by just 677 votes. The outcome appears as though it will be decided by outstanding absentee ballots. But Lamb and national Democrats declared victory anyway, given that Saccone needed to win a huge percentage of those absentees to close the gap.""It took a little longer than we thought, but we did it,"" Lamb told a roaring crowd at his election watch party at nearly 1 a.m. Wednesday morning.Introduced as ""congressman-elect,"" the Democrat struck a conciliatory tone and promised bipartisanship once he heads to D.C.""We fought to find common ground and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans. ... Our job in Congress is to attack the problems, not each other,"" Lamb said.But just before midnight, Saccone had come out to speak to his supporters, expressing confidence that they could still win.""It's not over yet,"" the GOP nominee said. ""We're going to fight all the way to the end. ... We're not giving up.""Just minutes after Saccone finished speaking, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee blasted out a statement declaring Lamb the victor, despite AP's having said it would not call the race Tuesday evening.""These results should terrify Republicans. ... Candidates and message matter and that was on full display in this election,"" DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Luján said.Meanwhile, the National Republican Congressional Committee signaled it is still waiting for all remaining ballots to be counted.""This race is too close to call and we're ready to ensure that every legal vote is counted,"" said NRCC Communications Director Matt Gorman. ""Once they are, we're confident Rick Saccone will be the newest Republican member of Congress.""Allegheny County counted its absentee ballots Tuesday evening. The elections director for Washington County told CNN it had 1,195 absentee ballots returned that would not be counted until Wednesday morning, but the county later reversed course and said it would begin counting them late Tuesday evening into the wee morning hours. And officials from Westmoreland County also told CNN that the 1,138 absentee ballots would be counted shortly as well, instead of on Wednesday morning.Even with such a photo finish, there is no provision for an automatic recount in a congressional race — only in statewide contests, per Pennsylvania election law. Voters can petition for a recount, however.President Trump won this Pittsburgh-area district by about 20 points in 2016, but it's Lamb who has run a high-energy race to challenge Saccone, after Rep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa., resigned last year amid a sex scandal. Republicans have privately grumbled that their candidate has been lackluster, and the Democrat seemed poised to pull off the upset. If Lamb does eke out the win, it would be the latest sign of worry yet for Republicans this fall. It's evidence of just how motivated Democrats are in 2018 and shows that the blue-collar coalition President Trump was able to build in the 2016 campaign is not necessarily transferable to other Republicans.While the close margin may give some solace to wary GOP members, it's still another example of Republican candidates way underperforming not just Trump's 2016 numbers but the past performance of the district, too. Murphy routinely won re-election and didn't even face a Democratic challenger the past two cycles. Other special congressional elections last year in deep red territory in Kansas, Montana and South Carolina also ended much closer than expected.If Republicans do lose this seat, the fact they were unsuccessful also shows that the GOP's economic argument to voters and touting its tax cuts may not be enough to save the party at the ballot box, either. While early ads in Pennsylvania focused on a fiscal message, closing arguments from Republican outside groups hit Lamb on immigration and crime instead.Trump visited the district for a rally on Saturday as a last-ditch rescue mission, where he asked his supporters, ""Do me a favor. Get out on Tuesday and vote for Rick Saccone."" Trump also referred to the Democrat as ""Lamb the sham,"" saying that if elected, Lamb would vote as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wants, even though the candidate has said he would not support keeping her as leader of the Democratic caucus.The president's visit capped off a massive effort by GOP groups to keep the seat in Republican hands. More than $10.6 million has been spent to support Saccone, about twice as much as has been spent for Lamb. That massive expenditure is despite the fact that the district won't even exist in its current form come November because of court-ordered redistricting, underscoring just how desperate Republicans were to avoid an embarrassing loss that would portend a growing blue wave.Lamb had outside support in the final days from former Vice President Joe Biden, a Pennsylvania native. The young former prosecutor and Marine veteran homed in on local issues and eschewed most national help, and even Republicans concede he has been an unusually tough candidate.If Saccone does win, President Trump would get credit for juicing Republican turnout in the final days. But even if he loses, the president does seem to have moved some election day voters the GOP's way, which Trump will surely seize on as well.Data in the last week of the race backed up assertions from the district that Saccone's fundraising was weak. Of the more than $10 million spent to support his campaign, less than 10 percent was from the Saccone campaign itself. On the Democratic side, about two-thirds of the money spent to support Lamb came from his campaign.National Democrats largely took a hands-off approach to the race and left most of the responsibility to Lamb's campaign, at least publicly. The DCCC stopped airing television ads weeks ago, leaving the Lamb campaign to purchase and air its own spots. But on the eve of the possible upset, the DCCC said it had invested more than $1 million in the race.That mirrors the approach the national party took in last year's Alabama Senate race. In Pennsylvania, the DCCC largely spent the money in a behind-the-scenes way meant to help Lamb keep the race locally focused. The national party transferred more than $400,000 to Pennsylvania's Democratic Party and spent $170,000 on digital ads and turnout efforts.In addition to that, the Democratic National Committee directed $370,000 into the race. The DNC sent $150,000 to the state party and helped the Lamb campaign raise an additional $220,000 through a joint email fundraising effort.One byproduct of all that money and the television ads that blanketed the Pittsburgh media market in recent weeks was a lot of confused voters. Pittsburgh public radio station WESA reported that election officials in Allegheny County fielded calls all day from angry would-be voters wanting to know why their polling place was closed. The answer: These people don't live in the 18th Congressional District.Democrats say that enthusiasm swing in a 20-point Trump district shows just how energized their voters are, even though it was a close race. It would be the first flip for House Republicans in the Trump era. A Georgia race also drew a lot of attention and money last year, but the GOP candidate eventually prevailed. Now, a Lamb victory would come on the heels of other Democratic victories, including big wins last year in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial contests, flipping 39 state legislative races from red to blue and an upset in last year's Alabama Senate race."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/13/593323095/house-intelligence-democrats-release-response-to-gop-russia-conclusions","Updated at 10:10 p.m. ETA day after the Republican members of the House intelligence committee released their findings from the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, which cleared President Trump's campaign of collusion, Democrats from the committee said today it was ""premature"" for the majority GOP members to conclude the probe, and that they would keep investigating.Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the committee, called the Republican decision to shut down the investigation a ""terrible disservice to the country and the American people,"" in announcing the release of a 21-page ""status report"" that laid out the Democrats' case to continue the probe.""The decision to shut down the investigation before key witnesses could be interviewed and vital documentary evidence obtained will prevent us from fully discharging our duty to the House and to the American people,"" the report from the Democrats says. It then lays out a long list of witnesses the committee hadn't yet interviewed or gotten enough documents from as of Monday, when Republicans on the committee deemed the investigation complete.The GOP members concluded that staffers of the Trump campaign who met with Russians may have displayed bad judgment, but nothing worse. The report affirmed that Russia was actively waging an ""active measures"" information campaign against the United States leading up to the 2016 election, but notably disputed that the Russian efforts were intended to help Trump win.Schiff appeared with fellow intelligence committee Democrats on Capitol Hill Tuesday evening and said the Republicans had put forth a ""pretense of trying to find the truth.""""We are going to do our best to continue our work. There are individuals who want to cooperate with our committee and share information, and will continue to do so,"" Schiff said. ""We will be putting together a report that will set out for the country what evidence we have seen to date.""The Democrats' retort is broken up into four sections: The Republican leading the House investigation, Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas, appeared to back away from the committee's Monday position that it had found no evidence that the Russians tried to help Trump. As Conaway told reporters on Tuesday, ""Whether or not they were trying to hurt Hillary, help Trump ... it's kind of the glass half full, glass half empty.""The House Intelligence has hosted a number of high profile open and closed hearings since starting its investigation into Russian interference last year, but it became apparent things were turning partisan when the Republican chairman of the committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, of California, was forced to recuse himself from the investigation last April. Since then, Republicans and Democrats on the committee have essentially been working separate investigations; it's unclear when the Democrats plan to release their own full report.The full ""status update"" from the Democratic members of the House intelligence committee is below.

""We were not really thinking the same ... with Mike, we have a very similar thought process.""State Department officials, on the other hand, said they were caught off guard.""The secretary had every intention of remaining because of the tangible progress made on critical national security issues,"" said Undersecretary of State Steve Goldstein. ""He established and enjoyed relationships with his counterparts. He will miss his colleagues at the Department of State and enjoyed working together with the Department of Defense in an uncommonly robust relationship.""Continued Goldstein: ""The secretary did not speak to the president this morning and is unaware of the reason, but he is grateful for the opportunity to serve and still believes strongly that public service is a noble calling and not to be regretted.""Later Tuesday, Goldstein was also fired, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Goldstein both confirmed to NPR's Tamara Keith.A senior administration official says White House chief of staff John Kelly called Tillerson on Friday and notified him that he would be replaced and ""that he was being asked to step down. It was made clear that it was imminent."" The official added that Kelly and Tillerson had a follow-up conversation on Saturday.""He was asked to step down,"" the official said, and he didn't.Trump and Tillerson have been described as talking often but sometimes appeared quite out of step on major foreign policy decisions.A White House official says the president wanted to have a new team in place in advance of upcoming talks with North Korea and ongoing trade negotiations.Tillerson, who was traveling in Africa last week, was caught flat-footed when the surprise announcement came that Trump had accepted an invitation to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Just a day earlier, he had told reporters that negotiations were a long way off.Trump has named Gina Haspel, Pompeo's former deputy and a CIA veteran, to take the helm of the spy agency.Haspel did not require Senate confirmation to serve in her deputy role but will to serve as the full-fledged director of the agency. Her hearing could exhume many CIA demons about the torture of terror suspects and the secret detention program that followed the 2001 terror attack.Democrats blasted what they called the nonstop chaos of the Trump White House, which they said meant it cannot focus on conducting business seriously.""The instability of this administration in just about every area weakens America,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.But another sometime-opponent of Trump's, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said he would move as quickly as possible to convene a confirmation hearing for Pompeo to run the State Department.""I had a very good conversation with Director Pompeo this morning and look forward to meeting with him soon,"" Corker said. ""As I shared with the president, the committee will consider his nomination as expeditiously as possible.""Slow burn Tillerson said at the State Department on Tuesday afternoon that he was grateful for the chance to serve in government and he thanked the foreign service officers and others who work on behalf of the United States abroad.Tillerson said he wants to arrange an orderly transition to Pompeo, whose Senate confirmation hearing is expected in April and appears to have the support to move into the State Department job.Tillerson said he has begun delegating responsibilities from his office to that of Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan.A former boss of Exxon Mobil, Tillerson didn't know Trump before 2016, and their relationship seemed to rupture after months of disputes over policy, embarrassing leaks and a few public humiliations by the president himself.Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he and Tillerson had always gotten along and that he was a ""good man,"" but their friction over tough issues such as the Iran nuclear deal had been what compelled Trump to replace him.The campaign may have been in the works for some time. A Nov. 30 report by The New York Times revealed the existence of a secret plan by Kelly to force out Tillerson and replace him with Pompeo.Trump would then nominate Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., to replace Pompeo, according to the Times. As it happened, Cotton is not getting the nomination to lead the CIA, after all.The report took care to say that the plan was ""tentative"" and that Trump hadn't yet approved it.That story followed other evidence that the relationship between the president and the nation's top diplomat was barely functional.Tillerson earlier said he would not resign in October after an NBC News report said Tillerson had called Trump a ""moron"" in July after a tense meeting at the Pentagon. Tillerson declined to deny it publicly, and Trump retorted to Forbes magazine that he was ready to compare ""I.Q."" tests — ""and I can tell you who's going to win.""Trump also undermined Tillerson's efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the situation in North Korea. As Tillerson kept up support for talks with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs, Trump said on Twitter on Oct. 1 that Tillerson was ""wasting his time.""""Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!"" Trump wrote.It was about five months later that Trump agreed to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Tillerson had also distanced himself from what critics have called Trump's equivocation between neo-Nazis and counterprotesters, who clashed over a Confederate monument in Charlottesville, Va.Tillerson appeared Aug. 27 on Fox News Sunday and was asked by host Chris Wallace about the way the international community views the United States following Trump's controversial comments about the protesters and counterprotesters in the wake of deadly violence in Charlottesville.""We express America's values from the State Department,"" Tillerson said. And later: ""The president speaks for himself, Chris.""Tillerson's departure makes him the latest member of Trump's inner circle in the administration to step down — following a series of White House aides, starting with national security adviser Mike Flynn and continuing on to chief strategist Steve Bannon, press secretary Sean Spicer, chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief economic adviser Gary Cohn — who have left their posts amid administration turbulence.In September, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was ousted over a travel expense scandal.Tillerson leaves behind a State Department that critics have called a shadow of its former self because of Tillerson's disconnection from the department and the White House's antipathy toward appointing or keeping top talent in the nation's diplomatic ranks.Some ambassadorships as well as top jobs at the department's Washington headquarters remain vacant.And speculation has swirled for so long that Tillerson might quit that this isn't the first wave of discussion about prospective replacements. A previous go-round centered on Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. and former governor of South Carolina. The New York Times reported there was tentative talk that Trump might appoint his daughter, Ivanka, as Haley's replacement at the U.N.For now, Haley remains in her post in New York and the Ivanka narrative appears to have cooled.Tillerson's tenure as America's top diplomat was unlikely. Trump interviewed more conventional candidates, including 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, but he ultimately gave the nod to the Texas oilman Tillerson based on a recommendation from former Defense Secretary Robert Gates.Tillerson told interviewers early on that he hadn't been looking for the job and was ""stunned"" to get Trump's offer — but his wife, Renda St. Clair, sold him."" 'I told you God's not through with you,' "" as Tillerson recounted his wife's remarks.OilmanTillerson had no government experience; he went to work in 1975 for Exxon Co., as it was then known, as an oil production engineer. But having risen to become CEO of the descendant Exxon Mobil, he effectively served as a kind of head of state — not only running the energy behemoth, but also conducting its foreign policy around the globe where it drilled or refined or conducted other operations.That work brought Tillerson into contact with all manner of leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, who awarded him Russia's Order of Friendship in 2013. Trump and Tillerson met with Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Germany in June, and then Tillerson continued follow-up negotiations with Russia until his departure from office.As secretary of state, Tillerson belonged to a cadre of leaders who sometimes preceded Trump on international travel to assuage allies' concerns about him. Or they returned after his visits to try to smooth things over.Tillerson, Vice President Pence, Defense Secretary James Mattis and others emphasized conventional points about American commitment to allies and to international norms and other longstanding points — often after Trump appeared willing to flout them.At the same time, Tillerson stayed in lockstep with the president on many matters of policy. He defended to the State Department press corps, for example, the realism that he said underpinned the administration's new strategy focused on Afghanistan, which amounted to the new goal of playing to a draw.""I think the president was clear this entire effort is intended to put pressure on the Taliban to have the Taliban understand: You will not win a battlefield victory. We may not win one, but neither will you,"" he said.At the same time, however, the new Afghanistan strategy will remain one of Tillerson's most significant elements of unfinished business. It depended upon a broad new diplomatic campaign across South Asia involving pressure on India and Pakistan to help with a good outcome in Afghanistan — even though, at the time, the United States did not have active ambassadors in India or Afghanistan."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/13/593145944/trump-cia-nominee-gina-haspel-faces-tough-road-to-senate-confirmation","Updated at 1:10 p.m. ETPresident Trump's nominee to take over the CIA faces a rocky confirmation hearing in the Senate and a narrow political path to secure the job.Deputy CIA Director Gina Haspel is a career intelligence officer widely respected within the agency but tied up inextricably with one of the ugliest chapters in its history. She ran a secret prison in Thailand where a suspect in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks was waterboarded 83 times — and then was involved with ordering evidence about that waterboarding to be destroyed.The CIA's network of clandestine prisons and use of brutal interrogation techniques, which critics also call torture, has been a political ulcer for the intelligence community since the administration of President George W. Bush. Haspel's role in it meant that when Trump nominated her for the No. 2 job last year, critics within and outside of Congress called for her to be blocked even though she did not require Senate confirmation.To become full director, however, she will. Haspel is up for the top job because Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday and announced he planned to nominate CIA Director Mike Pompeo to take his place. So Haspel would need to go through what could be a bruising confirmation hearing that reopens the vault on secret prisons, torture, alleged cover-ups and accountability.Haspel would be the first woman to lead the CIA, and Trump told reporters outside the White House that he had gotten to know her well.Intelligence veterans call Haspel one of their own and say the time is right for her to hold the reins.""When she was selected to be deputy director, I think the choice was enthusiastically received at CIA,"" former National Security Agency Director Michael Hayden told NPR's Morning Edition on Tuesday. ""In all this turmoil, I actually think CIA is going to be a bit of a calm spot with Gina now being elevated to the director position.""Everyone at the CIA in the post-Sept. 11 era was simply doing what they were asked to do in the aftermath of a crisis, Hayden said.Opponents, however, made clear that they believe the Senate intelligence committee should not confirm Haspel.""During Gina Haspel's long tenure at the CIA, she oversaw the agency's torture and rendition program, one of the bleakest chapters in our nation's history. No one who had a hand in torturing individuals deserves to ever hold public office again, let alone lead an agency,"" said Raha Wala, director of national security advocacy for Human Rights First. ""To allow someone who had a direct hand in this illegal, immoral and counterproductive program is to willingly forget our nation's dark history with torture,"" Wala added.Other opponents said Pompeo and Haspel should be able to go forward into new roles so long as they made a clear break with brutal interrogations and the past conduct of the CIA.""Both nominees would have to disavow all previous statements and actions advocating this unlawful conduct if they are to be seriously considered as candidates,"" said Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA.  ""Torture, extraordinary rendition, and indefinite detention are unacceptable, and we cannot allow human rights abuses to be condoned in the name of national security,"" she said.Many Democrats, however, may fully oppose Haspel. Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico both wrote Trump last year to say they felt she should not get the deputy director job at CIA. Wyden said on Tuesday that he feels the same way now.""Ms. Haspel's background makes her unsuitable to serve as CIA director. Her nomination must include total transparency about this background, which I called for more than a year ago when she was appointed deputy director,"" his statement read. ""If Ms. Haspel seeks to serve at the highest levels of U.S. intelligence, the government can no longer cover up disturbing facts from her past."" Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins, a key voice on the intelligence committee, said on Tuesday that she would reserve judgment for now.""I have met Gina and I know of her decades of experience at the CIA,"" Collins said. ""I prefer to wait to have a confirmation hearing before making a decision on her nomination. She certainly has the expertise and experience as a 30-year employee at the agency. But I'm sure there's going to be some questions raised.""Opponents in the wider Senate made clear there could be no correct answers to these questions.""I voted against Mr. Pompeo's nomination to be CIA director because he failed to express moral opposition to torture, but Ms. Haspel has done much worse,"" said Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill. ""Not only did she directly supervise the torture of detainees, but she also participated in covering it up by helping to destroy the video evidence,"" Duckworth said. ""Her reprehensible actions should disqualify her from having the privilege of serving the American people in government ever again, but apparently this president believes they merit a promotion.""If Democrats elect to oppose Haspel as a bloc in committee or the full Senate, Republicans will need all the votes they can get in order to confirm her, assuming the ailing Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., remains absent from the chamber. McCain said on Tuesday: ""The torture of detainees in U.S. custody during the last decade was one of the darkest chapters in American history. Ms. Haspel needs to explain the nature and extent of her involvement in the CIA's interrogation program during the confirmation process.""Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., opposed Pompeo as CIA director, and if he opposes Haspel as well, that could make for a narrow tightrope to walk. Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, however, appeared eager to get Haspel's nomination on his committee's calendar.""I know Gina personally and she has the right skill set, experience, and judgment to lead one of our nation's most critical agencies,"" he said.""I'm proud of her work, and know that my committee will continue its positive relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency under her leadership. I look forward to supporting her nomination, ensuring its consideration without delay.""NPR correspondent Susan Davis contributed to this report"
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/13/593239313/on-visit-to-california-trump-tours-mockups-of-his-long-promised-border-wall","Updated at 5:47 p.m. ETPresident Trump is making his first visit to California since taking office, using the whirlwind trip to view prototypes for his signature border wall proposal and promote his defense policies to troops stationed in San Diego. The trip Tuesday opened with a viewing of the eight options that his administration has selected for testing — and that might serve as his long-promised wall along the border of the U.S. and Mexico, if Congress decides to allot the funds to do so.""If you didn't have walls,"" Trump told reporters during his tour, ""you wouldn't have a country.""The president's arrival was awaited in the area by a cluster of police, chanting protesters and supporters clad in campaign gear, waving American flags.Also at the site, awaiting him in contrasting silence, are the roughly 30-foot mockups the Department of Homeland Security picked to give a closer look — four of which are solid concrete, while the other four are built of ""other materials,"" including steel. Built by private contractors from across the country, from Maryland to Arizona, the prototypes have been funded with $20 million from Customs and Border Protection.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and several Border Patrol officials briefed the president on the ongoing assessment of the prototypes, the White House says, ""with a focus on how the features and attributes of each impedes illegal crossings.""Ultimately, the Trump administration expects that the whole border wall, when completed, would cost about $18 billion — though other estimates have ranged up to $38 billion. Despite a concerted effort from the White House and many GOP lawmakers, efforts to apportion that money have stalled in Congress, along with broader conversations around the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals and other immigration programs.Trump's campaign pledge to build a massive wall along the border between the U.S. and Mexico has proven just as divisive outside Capitol Hill. Just a day before Trump's arrival in California, the state's Democratic governor, Jerry Brown, called on the president to extend the focus of his visit beyond the wall.""You see, in California we are focusing on bridges, not walls. And that's more than just a figure of speech,"" Brown said in a letter to the president he posted publicly Monday.""After you've examined your wall prototypes on the border,"" he added, ""I invite you to head north to the Central Valley — the heart of California. Here in cities like Fresno and Madera more than a dozen bridges are being built for the nation's first and only High-Speed Rail line.""Others, such as San Diego-based immigration advocate Andrea Guerrero, see the president's proposal as an alarming symbol of the policies his administration has pursued.""The wall is more than a wall,"" she told NPR's Richard Gonzales before Trump's arrival. ""In the shadow of that wall, a deportation force is growing and it is ripping families from one another. It is devastating communities well within the interior of the United States.""During remarks to media Tuesday, Trump countered those fears by raising still others.""There's a lot of problems in Mexico — they have a lot of problems over there,"" he said. ""The fact is, if you don't have a wall system it would be bedlam, I imagine.""Later, he stopped in at the nearby Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar, addressing an often-boisterous crowd — and promoting what he called ""the largest military buildup since Ronald Reagan and one of the largest buildups we've ever had in the history of our nation.""Among other things, the president promised the assembled members of the military their ""largest pay raise in over a decade,"" brand-new warplanes and and a national strategy that ""recognizes that space is a war fighting domain — just like the land, air and sea.""""We may even have a 'space force,' "" he added. ""Develop another one: We have the Air Force, we'll have the space force.""He is expected to wrap up his day in Los Angeles with a fundraiser later in the evening."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/13/593122414/russian-roulette-authors-seek-to-connect-the-dots-between-trump-and-putin","For more than a year now, journalists Michael Isikoff and David Corn have been devoted to covering the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.Isikoff was the first reporter to reveal that there was a U.S. intelligence investigation into Russian ties to a figure in the Trump campaign — Carter Page. Corn was the first to reveal the existence of the infamous Russia dossier, the unverified collection of reports alleging connections between the Trump campaign and Russia compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele.Now, in their new book, Russian Roulette, the two men attempt to put all the pieces of the story together.""We start the book with Donald Trump's trip to Moscow in 2013, when he really first forms this 'bromance' with Vladimir Putin,"" Isikoff says.Isikoff notes that Trump's 2013 trip to Russia for the Miss Universe pageant centered on a business deal: ""He signed a letter of intent to build a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Putin-connected oligarch, Aras Agalarov.""In 2016, Agalarov would later be one of the conduits for what was described to Donald Trump Jr. as an offer of help to the Trump campaign by the Russian government.The earlier potential deal for the Moscow Trump Tower fell through, Isikoff says, after the Obama administration and the European Union imposed sanctions on Russia following the annexation of Crimea and the invasion of Ukraine.But Corn says that the stalled deal may help explain other elements of the story: ""People have been trying to figure out for years the positive remarks that Donald Trump has made about Vladimir Putin ... It's almost hiding in plain sight that one reason he has for saying all these kind things about Putin is that he was always interested in doing business deals there.""On Trump's interest in meeting Vladimir Putin during his 2013 trip to MoscowMichael Isikoff: This is when he's presiding over the Miss Universe pageant. He goes to great lengths to try to get a meeting with Putin. It doesn't come through for a variety of interesting reasons, but he then wants to tell the world that he met with Putin anyway, and he actually repeatedly does, even though he didn't.But you can see the seeds of the Trump-Putin relationship in that trip. And what was it all about? It was all about a business deal. He signed a letter of intent to build a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Putin-connected oligarch, Aras Agalarov, and it was something that was a very high priority for him and had been for many years.On how the project to build a Trump Tower in Moscow influenced Trump's views on Russia Isikoff: In February 2014, Ivanka Trump travels to Moscow to scout potential sites for the Trump Tower with Emin Agalarov and the project doesn't ultimately go through. Why? ... One development that may well have played a big factor ... was ... this is right at the time Putin has annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine, stiff sanctions are put on by the Obama administration and the European Union, including Sberbank, the bank that was going to finance the [Trump Tower] operation.And Rob Goldstone, who is quoted in the book — and this is, I believe, the first interview he's given to anybody about these developments — says he believes that it was the imposition of sanctions that killed the deal and that this may well have influenced Trump's view of sanctions and his advocacy later on, during the presidential campaign, of lifting sanctions on Russia.David Corn: Sberbank is majority-owned by the Russian state, by the Russian government. Which means that Trump was trying to enter into a deal that involved the Russian government. And, of course, no major projects can take place in Moscow — and this is a deal worth billions of dollars — without the approval of the government. And who runs the government? Vladimir Putin.On the Trump administration's denial of Russian interference in the election Corn: [Trump's circle] had reason to believe more than anybody else that there was a Russian effort to help and to boost Trump. They knew that members of their own campaign — people like George Papadopoulos and Carter Page — were making connections with Russian officials and Russian cutouts. And Trump was even briefed in mid-August 2016 when he was a candidate about the Russian hacking of the election and still after that continued to say it wasn't happening ... Again and again and again, Trump and his defenders say that there was no contact with Russia, ""We did nothing wrong.""Put that all together with a little bit of distance and you see how the Trump campaign and Trump himself almost in a way aided and abetted what the Russians were doing by continually denying that they had any role in the election and making it difficult for the United States and the Obama administration to forge a bipartisan response to what was happening.On a Russian general who wrote a paper outlining Russia's information war Corn: His name was Gen. [Valery] Gerasimov, and this came out in an obscure military journal in early 2013 and no one paid much attention to it until a translation appeared a few months later. He basically said, listen, the war of the future will not be played out in real space. It won't be between battalions and fleet of aircraft and fighter jets, it's going to come about through other means.It was pretty stunning to see it in retrospect — [he] talked about how to take advantage of the divisions within your enemy. If you look at what happened in 2016 with the social media campaign and with the hacks and dumps that the Russians pulled off, what they did was exploit existing sometimes very bitter divisions within America.They did it on Facebook, they did it on Twitter, they figured out how to turn Bernie Sanders supporters against Hillary Clinton, they really took advantage of some of the political conflict and strife that we're ultimately responsible for in the United States, but that was one of the things that the general pointed to that could be weaponized, and they did so quite well, I think, in 2016.Sam Briger and Thea Chaloner produced and edited this interview for broadcast. Bridget Bentz, Molly Seavy-Nesper and Philip Ewing adapted it for the Web."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/13/592989422/4-questions-ahead-of-the-special-election-in-pennsylvania","Tuesday's neck-and-neck special election in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District carries a lot of weight for both parties — despite the fact that it won't even exist in its current iteration come November.Republicans have gone all-in to try to save underperforming state Rep. Rick Saccone. The GOP nominee got an eleventh-hour rescue-mission visit Saturday from President Trump, who carried the district by about 20 points in the 2016 presidential election. GOP-allied groups have poured in more than $10 million to help Saccone, who has underwhelmed in fundraising. If that's not enough to save him, it would be an embarrassing and alarming loss for Republicans eight months from the midterm elections.Meanwhile, even Republicans privately concede that Democratic nominee Connor Lamb — a charismatic, young former Marine and prosecutor — is the superior recruit. He has brought in far more money than the GOP candidate in this traditionally solidly red district near Pittsburgh. Lamb has raised $3 million in the race, while Democratic outside groups stayed mostly on the sidelines. They have put in only about $1.7 million, allowing Lamb to run a more independent race.Lamb has cut a moderate profile with a populist tinge. He has said he would oppose Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader and has also wooed steelworkers, coal miners and union activists in this blue-collar district. He has a somewhat similar economic message to that of Trump when he campaigned and won here.This special election was triggered by the resignation of former Rep. Tim Murphy, who stepped down after it was revealed that he — an anti-abortion-rights congressman — had had an extramarital affair and pressured his mistress to terminate a possible pregnancy.Because of court-ordered redistricting, the district as it is drawn now will cease to exist come Election Day 2018, and neither Saccone nor Lamb will even live in the rejiggered seat. So the fact that Republicans are spending so heavily to save what's essentially a phantom district underscores what is on the line: They don't want a loss in such a GOP stronghold to spur even more panic among their ranks that Trump is dragging them down.Meanwhile, Democrats are salivating for an upset that will further galvanize their energetic base hoping for a blue wave in November. To this point, since Trump has been president, Republicans have underperformed in GOP-held House special elections but still won all five of them.Polls close at 8 p.m. ET. Here are four questions to ponder in the meantime:1. Will this be a canary in the coal mine for the GOP?A few months ago, when a rash of retirements seemed like the latest alarm bells for Republicans, GOP strategists urged caution. Some pointed to this Pennsylvania race — where Saccone was still heavily favored — as the possible canary in the coal mine to watch for Republicans. This race, they said, could be a much bigger sign of danger ahead for the GOP.If Lamb does win on Tuesday night, it could send even more GOP members of Congress heading for the exits, adding to what's already a record number of retirements.The ominous signs have been there for some time for Republicans. Since Trump's election, 39 state legislative races have flipped from red to blue. Democrats notched big wins last November in both the Virginia and New Jersey governors' races.And special House elections last year across the board showed a major shift toward Democrats, even if they didn't notch a victory in a GOP-held race yet. Republicans have far underperformed in special elections in Kansas, Montana and South Carolina — all solidly GOP territory.Democrats did score a major upset in December in the Alabama Senate race, flipping a seat in a state that Trump carried by nearly 30 points. In that contest, Republicans were running a deeply flawed candidate in GOP nominee Roy Moore, long a controversial figure in state Republican circles. Several women accused him of sexual misconduct and pursuing them romantically when they were teenagers and he was much older.Republicans are already trying to paint Saccone as a weak candidate, but blaming him for underperforming is hardly a credible excuse in such a Republican area. It would instead be a sure sign of danger ahead, at least in the narrative that would form about 2018: what it would mean for GOP morale, fundraising and the power of the president to help candidates over the line.No race is a perfect predictor, and Republicans will also surely note that before their own massive wave in 2010 that helped them capture control of the House, there was another Pennsylvania special election that went Democrats' way. That race certainly was no sign of their fortunes come November.Still, there's been more than enough evidence in the 16 months since Trump was elected that the energy on the Democratic side is very real. Now, a Lamb win would mean that even areas that were once considered safe GOP territory might no longer be.2. Is the Trump coalition transferable?Trump rode into town Saturday night in nearby Moon Township to campaign for Saccone. He had a trademark wild and unpredictable rally to help Saccone. He boasted that he was able to help save the Georgia special election in a similar fashion and later tweeted about it:The president even gave the Democratic nominee his own Trump-branded nickname, ""Lamb the sham."" He made the case for Saccone, who has run as an unabashedly pro-Trump candidate, before turning to myriad other topics and insults.It was all classic Trump — eager to claim credit despite scant evidence he helped move many poll numbers, as in Georgia. He didn't mention other places where he has gone in and lost — like Alabama, where he first backed the losing primary candidate and then failed to get Moore across the finish line.For Trump, every day is Nov. 8, 2016. He revels in reliving that historic night and boasting of his unexpected victory over Hillary Clinton. But now Tuesday night could show whether Trump's winning coalition is transferable to other candidates — or not.Democrats faced a similar problem under President Obama. As NPR's Domenico Montanaro calculated, when Obama was on the ballot, Democrats gained 31 seats in the House and nine in the Senate. When he wasn't, the party lost 82 seats in the House and 17 in the Senate.Obama's popularity dropped during his tenure, and he was, indeed, a drag on his own party in 2010 after the Affordable Care Act passed. But Obama's numbers were stronger than Trump's, and there wasn't the constant chaos and scandal plaguing the current White House.Ultimately, Trump's unpopularity remains the biggest detriment for Republicans in the midterms. It raises the question of how Trump could be — or is willing to not be — dispatched on behalf of Republicans on the trail over the coming months. That will be even more acute if Saccone loses. Even places like the Rust Belt where he was once seen as an asset may not be a given any longer.While Trump doesn't like to be associated with anything losing, he also never passes up a chance to get before a crowd. So while he may salivate at campaigning more, it could be hard for anyone in the GOP to make the case to the president he would hurt more than help.Republicans have already been trying to downplay expectations ahead of a loss too, with Pennsylvania GOP Chairman Val DiGiorgio making the stunning argument on Fox News Monday that ""this is a Democrat district"" despite Trump's heavy win — even though past GOP presidential nominees also performed similarly and Murphy routinely won re-election easily, or even went unopposed. A Democrat hasn't won here in 15 years.3. Can the economy and tax bill save Republicans — or not? The silver bullet for Republicans in the midterms could be the positive economy — and the GOP tax cuts they passed last year that are growing in popularity.Yet that argument wasn't used much in the final stretch to help Saccone in Pennsylvania. Early ads touted economic growth and the tax overhaul, while hitting Lamb for downplaying the impact of the tax cuts. But in the final stretch, that message was abandoned for much more ominous ads hammering Lamb over immigration and crime.That was the same dark turn Republicans took in Virginia last fall — a gambit that failed. So if that's their closing message, it's a sign that the political boon they hoped to gain from an economic boom might not be working. And, as much as Democrats haven't figured out messaging on the tax bill, Republicans may not have either.One of the unknowns is how the recently announced tariffs could affect the race. Areas like the 18th District, where blue-collar Democrats crossed party lines to vote for Trump, have been hard hit in an age of globalization. Trump's imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum would seem to be tailor-made to boost political support in economically distressed areas like this.However, a Monmouth University poll (taken before Trump's visit), which showed Lamb with a narrow lead — both under regular- and high-turnout scenarios — found the tariff announcement didn't seem to sway voters at all. Plus, both Saccone and Lamb have been supportive of the tariffs.4. Can Republicans' anti-Pelosi message still work?Lamb has run a more centrist campaign and underscored local issues. That has helped him close the gap and win crossover Republicans. But this race is also a test of whether Democrats can blunt what has been one of Republicans' most effective weapons — Nancy Pelosi.Lamb has run ads boasting about how he would oppose Pelosi as Democrats' House leader — or even speaker — if he is elected, echoing pushes by like-minded legislators such as Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan and Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton in calling for new leadership. And the surrogates he has had campaign for him, like former Vice President Joe Biden, have a much different appeal to voters in this area than the San Franciscan could.Nevertheless, Republicans have been repeatedly able to turn Pelosi into a political bogeyman, dragging down surging candidates by tying her to them. It was a strategy they first employed successfully in 2010 — and replicated it. They most recently used it in last year's Georgia special election.Ads from outside GOP-aligned groups have continued to argue that Lamb would still be a Pelosi lackey even though he says now he wants new leadership. But if Lamb is able to survive being linked to Pelosi, it could be an encouraging sign for Democratic candidates across the country, some of whom have already signaled they want new leadership, as well.Pelosi remains a fundraising machine for the Democrats, and she still wields considerable influence. But if Democrats want to win back the House, a Lamb win might show they need more candidates like the Pennsylvanian in conservative areas who are willing to buck the status quo and go against party leadership.And that could raise even more questions of who will be in the leader's chair come 2019."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/13/593071082/trump-visits-u-s-mexico-border-to-tout-long-promised-wall","President Trump visits California Tuesday where he will appear at the U.S.-Mexico border to promote the prototypes of the border wall he has promised to build in his fight against illegal immigration.There will be protests by opponents who oppose construction of the wall, as well as local supporters who say a border wall is exactly what's needed to keep the country safe.The prototypes are being displayed near where there is already about 14 miles of border fencing topped with razor wire.To get a good look at the existing border fence, just go to the San Diego district of San Ysidro, just north of the border with Tijuana. There is a massive premium outlet mall with retail names familiar to any American consumer.""You'll see a lot of pedestrians shop here. This is a regional international shopping center where you'll get international visitors coming to shop here,"" said David Flores. He works for Casa Familiar, a local non-profit focused on revitalizing the economy of this border district.On a recent driving tour of San Ysidro, he turned to the back end of the mall which butts up against a triple-layered fence separating the United States from Mexico.There is a stunning contrast between the mall that attracts shoppers from Tijuana and the fence that is designed to keep other Mexicans out says the CEO of Casa Familiar, Lisa Cuestas,""It doesn't matter that that fence is there. There's something bigger going on here,"" Cuestas said.She was talking about the economic links between communities on both sides of the border, in this case San Diego and Tijuana. But as President Trump visits this border district today to inspect the prototypes of the wall he hopes to build, commerce is not likely to be high on his agenda.And that's OK with Jeff Schwilk, founder of San Diegans for Secure Borders. Schwilk said the existing fence, between 14 to 18 feet high is good, but a taller wall would be even better.""Fences work just like [they] might [to] keep bad people out of your property at home,"" he said. ""Fences between countries, when you have a lot of bad people trying to sneak in, absolutely cuts down on the illegal entries. If that's what we have to have, then that's what we have to have.""Schwilk and his group will be among those who will rally in favor of the president while he is visiting the wall prototypes.The prototypes are eight 30-foot high slabs of steel and concrete displayed by private contractors hoping to land the job of building the multi-billion dollar wall. The administration forecasts spending about $18 billion. The project is stalled out in Congress.Opponents of the wall say it is unnecessary and wasteful.""The wall is more than a wall. In the shadow of that wall, a deportation force is growing and it is ripping families from one another. It is devastating communities well within the interior of the United States,"" said Andrea Guerrero, the executive director of Alliance San Diego, a coalition of immigrant advocates.Guerrero pointed to the arrest last week of a mother on a sidewalk in front of her children in nearby National City. A video of her apprehension by Border Patrol agents was posted on Facebook and went viral, angering many in the immigrant community.Border Patrol officials allege that the woman, Perla Morales-Luna, was involved in smuggling operations— a charge her attorney denies.Trump's visit to the border follows on the heels of Attorney General Jeff Sessions who came to California last week. He announced that the Justice Department is suing California to block the state's sanctuary laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities.State officials, starting with Gov. Jerry Brown, are promising to fight the lawsuits."

Dean Heller in return for a Trump endorsement in a House race instead.Tarkanian, a conservative businessman in Nevada and son of legendary UNLV basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian, had been challenging Heller in this year’s Republican primary for the U.S. Senate.But on Friday, Trump tweeted: “It would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada, and it’s unity if good guy Danny Tarkanian would run for Congress and Dean Heller, who is doing a really good job, could run for Senate unopposed!”Shortly after that tweet, Tarkanian, who has previously unsuccessfully sought public office before, released a statement saying he planned to drop out of the Senate race and run in the third congressional district.He said Trump and his political team reached out to him on Wednesday and “asked me to consider supporting the America First agenda as a congressional candidate” in the third district. Tarkanian lost to Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen by just one point in 2016.

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/16/new-york-rep-louise-slaughter-top-democrat-and-only-microbiologist-in-congress-dies-at-88.html","New York Rep. Louise Slaughter, the top Democrat on the powerful House Rules Committee and the only microbiologist in the Congress, died Friday at a Washington hospital just days after being injured in a fall at home, her congressional office said.She was 88.Known as one of the most liberal members of Congress, Slaughter played an integral part of the Violence Against Women Act, the Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act, the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act and writing President Barack Obama’s health care law.Originally from Lynch, Kentucky, Slaughter brought her dedication to public health and her southern drawl all the way to Washington in 1986. Slaughter quickly earned a reputation. As a freshman Slaughter said her colleagues would “just smile and say, 'Oh, you're the one from New York who doesn't sound like it.’”Slaughter was first elected to Congress in 1986 after four years in the New York State Assembly.Slaughter co-authored the Violence Against Women Act in 1994. The measure helps the investigations and prosecutions of crimes against women. During the law’s reauthorization in 2013, Slaughter said “Today’s signing of the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization into law gives women and all victims of domestic violence across America the peace of mind that their government will not abandon them in their time of need.”Slaughter’s younger sister, Virginia, caught double pneumonia and died. Her sister’s death persuaded Slaughter to focus on health policy while in Congress.“That we have children coming into this world already polluted, at the same time we don't know what the effects of that pollution will be on their mental and physical development, is both bad policy and immorally wrong,” Slaughter said.Until the end, Slaughter blamed the coal-infused air of Harlan County, KY for her sister’s demise.Slaughter was the first female elected to Congress from western New York. Slaughter also served as the first chairwoman of the House Rules Committee from. She had been the top Democrat on the panel in recent years.Slaughter was the daughter of a blacksmith. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., noted that Slaughter never forgot that in her work on Capitol Hill.Slaughter was born Louise McIntosh and was a distant relative of American folk life hero Daniel Boone. The mother of three daughters, Slaughter once quipped “Our girls have learned that sweat is sexy, brawn is beautiful and a little dirt never hurt anyone.”She married Bob Slaughter in 1957. They were married for 57 years until his death in 2014. Her husband used to drive the Congresswoman back and forth from the district in upstate New York to Washington until he passed away. Bob Slaughter would often sit in on meetings of the House Rules Committee.In, 2014, Slaughter eked out a victory in the closest race of her political career. She defeated Republican Mark Assini by a margin of 869 votes. She planned to run for reelection this year.Slaughter authored the STOCK Act (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge), which barred insider trading in Congress by lawmakers, staff and other officials including the president. The measure became law on April 4, 2012. Ethics watchdogs regard the law of the most-significant pieces of ethics legislation in years.During her career on the Rules Committee, Slaughter famously tangled with Republicans.During one Rules Committee hearing in 2012 to fund transportation projects, Slaughter argued that the GOP plan to split the 1,000-plus page bill into three pieces demonstrated a lack of transparency. She traded barbs with then-Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier, R-Calif.“If the bill was a mistake, then why didn’t we do it in three parts in the first place?”“I didn’t say it was a mistake,” Dreier responded. “It’s now an opportunity for members to amend the legislation.”“Nice try,” Slaughter said.“Thank you,” Dreier replied sarcastically.In 1991, Slaughter joined six of her fellow women in the House to protest the Senate confirmation vote for the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court. They led the push to allow law professor Anita Hill to testify before Congress about her sexual harassment allegations against Thomas.The posse of female lawmakers tried to walk into the weekly Senate Democratic caucus luncheon off the chamber floor. But they were barred from entering despite multiple knocks at the door.“We were told that nobody ever gets in there,” Slaughter told The New York Times. “Certainly not women from the House.”After their protest caused a stir, then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-ME) eventually met with the women following the luncheon.A talented vocalist, Slaughter sang with Tinker Baggerly and his orchestra when they performed gigs at semi-formals and dances around Lexington during her time at the University of Kentucky“I could make a turnip cry,” Slaughter said of her crooning talent. In 2013, Congress hurtled toward a government shutdown. Slaughter relied on her musical training to criticize Republican dithering as the funding deadline approached.“Old sheet music back in the 1930s and 1940s used to have a notation printed across the top,” said Slaughter. “It would say ‘vamp til ready.’”In the big band and swing eras, a “vamp” was a series of repetitive, symmetrical bars of notes. They’re often the recognizable “hook” of a number. Vamps were commonplace back when names like Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey led big bands. The musicians would simply play the same music over and over again waiting for the vocalist to jump in as they chatted with the crowd. Once the vocalist was ready, the musicians would dive in with the rest of the tune. Hence the term “vamp ‘til ready.”Slaughter frequently accused Republicans of wasting time, simply “vamping ‘til ready” as precious days slipped off the calendar.Slaughter was a key player in the Democrats push to approve the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010. Slaughter was a fierce proponent of reproductive rights. In November, 2009, New York Democrat refused to chair the Rules Committee hearing prepping Obamacare for the floor after learning that then-Speaker Pelosi demanded the panel make a sole, substantive amendment in order. The amendment was the “Stupak amendment,” named after then-Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich. The Stupak amendment enhanced a firewall prohibiting the use of federal dollars to pay for abortions. Pelosi’s decision to include the Stupak amendment proved key to the passage of Obamacare. The amendment courted the votes of conservative and pro-life Democrats.The Senate found itself in a quandary after the House approved the initial health care package in late 2009. House Democrats fumed as Senate Democrats wrestled with arcane procedure to find a path to approve Obamacare.“I think the Red Queen wrote those rules over there,” declared Slaughter of the Senate.Republicans heaped grief on Slaughter in March, 2010 during the final steps toward approving Obamacare. Democrats tinkered with House custom in order to get the final version of Obamacare on the floor and through the Rules Committee. Since Slaughter chaired the Rules Committee, Republicans christened the parliamentary chicanery the “Slaughter Solution,” pirating the Congresswoman’s married surname.After a public firestorm Democrats abandoned the parliamentary sleight-of-hand and handled the bill the bill in the committee the old-fashioned way.House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on Friday ordered the flags at the Capitol complex to be flown at half-staff in her honor."

The case became a political lightning rod in the national debate over sanctuary city laws and illegal immigration.Zarate had been released from a San Francisco jail a few months before the shooting, despite a request by immigration authorities to detain him for deportation – leading to scrutiny and criticism of the city's ""sanctuary city"" laws.Days after the verdict, a federal grand jury indicted Garcia-Zarate on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm and being “an alien illegally and unlawfully in the United States in possession of a firearm.”Garcia filed a motion requesting documents related to the federal case on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of California, the Courthouse News reported. The motion claims that the case is accusing him of the same allegations he was already convicted for in state court – a violation of double jeopardy laws – and that he is being vindictively prosecuted by the federal government.""The true federal interest in pursuing this prosecution is to punish and make an example out of Mr. Garcia-Zarate for his high-profile acquittal in state court,"" the motion reads. ""This prosecution seeks to demonstrate to any high-profile defendant, especially one that is an undocumented immigrant, that their successful exercise of due process rights will not be respected and will result in the heavy hammer of a federal prosecution.""The motion points to the national publicity surrounding the case and how then-candidate Donald Trump used the case as a symbol of the dangers of illegal immigration, calling Garcia-Zarate an “animal.” As president, Trump branded the verdict “disgraceful” and a “travesty of justice.”The motion also points to comments made by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in which he blamed San Francisco’s sanctuary city policy after the verdict, noting that he would not have been on the streets “if the city simply honored” a detainer by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The motion claims that with that backdrop, the federal government was “critically involved” in Garcia-Zarate’s initial prosecution, including producing video, the weapon, and also the production of witnesses for questioning in the case. “Through counsel, Mr. Garcia-Zarate intends to bring motions to dismiss this prosecution on those grounds.”Garcia-Zarate's motion seeks discovery of all documents and correspondence between the federal government and local authorities related to the case."

Clinton underwent an X-ray and a CT scan that confirmed a hairline fracture of her right wrist.The Times of India reported that Clinton had been given a plaster bandage and advised to go for another checkup in three days. The injury does not impact Clinton's ability to travel.Earlier in the week, video showed Clinton slipping on stairs twice as she visited the Jahaz Mahal in the ancient city of Mandu.

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/16/saudi-arabia-as-crown-prince-mbs-heads-to-us-for-visit-here-s-how-to-encourage-reform.html","Western analysts are publishing a host of commentaries in anticipation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman’s upcoming visit to the United States in the week ahead, including a meeting with President Trump on Tuesday.Unfortunately, many of these analyses mischaracterize a lot of what the crown prince is doing in Saudi Arabia, while depicting him as a profligate individual who is ruthless at home and reckless abroad.This approach misses the forest for the trees. The key factor to look at is that for the first time in 40 years, a bold leader has emerged in Saudi Arabia, determined to face all the challenges previous leaders have been kicking down the road for decades.Western reports have also routinely understated the extraordinary domestic and foreign policy challenges facing the crown prince, most especially Saudi anxiety over unchecked Iranian expansionism and the existential threat it poses to the kingdom.There is no precedent for the crown prince’s decision to immediately plunge headfirst into the treacherous waters of reform, after taking control of an opaque and ultraconservative oil monarchy that many blame for exporting Wahhabism (a conservative form of Islam).MBS is determined to upend 50 years of incremental, quietist and often reactionary policymaking. As a result, the 32-year-old crown prince has launched a relentless quest to offset decades of lethargy and inaction by his elders so he can drag his country into the 21st century.MBS has performed bold economic surgery by reducing state subsidies, privatizing key state assets and introducing direct payments to help the poor. And he has struck a heavy blow to the system of elite privileges, which have been draining the kingdom’s coffers, by arresting prominent grandees for corruption.While it is fair to bemoan the lack of due process and the absence of transparency surrounding the detentions the government ordered in November of over 200 princes, government officials and business executives accused of corruption, it is also reasonable to ask whether formal legal proceedings would have been a viable alternative.Pursuing court cases against hundreds of elites in a drawn-out public process would have brought the country to a virtual standstill by monopolizing people’s attention for years on end. Think of hundreds of O.J. Simpson trials on steroids.While the anti-corruption crackdown has shaken business confidence and frozen investment, history tells us that this pause will be temporary. Countries that have weathered comparable shocks and even defaults (which are far more severe), have seen investors return as soon as the economy begins trending positive.MBS’s domestic reforms go hand in hand with his head-on fight against Islamic extremism. The crown prince is the first leader in half a century who has had the guts to take on religious conservatives, some of whom provided the ideological fuel for the jihadist fire. He has publicly, loudly and unequivocally denounced extremism, jailed many regressive clerics and intimidated the rest into silence.By allowing Saudi women to drive – a move reactionaries virulently opposed as a “wedge issue” that would allow liberalism to take over the country – MBS broke a huge legal and psychological barrier to women’s empowerment.Should the crown prince succeed in his campaign against extremism, the implications for the kingdom and the Islamic world will be far-reaching.Idealists who chastise Saudi Arabia for restricting political freedoms should remember that, from China to South Korea, no developing nation has successfully implemented such wrenching and rapid reform within a free democratic pluralistic environment.Saudi Arabia lacks virtually all of the building blocks required to exercise such political freedoms, and there is an unbridgeable ideological gap between the nation’s Islamic reactionary right and its Western liberal left. Consequently, only a benevolent autocracy can impose sweeping and urgent change.Regionally, MBS realizes that Saudi fears about the unfolding Iranian threat can no longer be addressed by calling on Uncle Sam to send in the cavalry. The crown prince’s determination to transform the kingdom into a military actor willing to “carry its own water” (to paraphrase long-standing American criticism of Saudi overreliance on U.S. protection) led to the Yemen war. As far as Saudis are concerned, this is a war of necessity.Certainly, the human suffering in this war, or any war, is tragic. But what does a country do when it feels imperiled by an enemy emerging on its border who, if ignored, could ultimately pose an existential threat?Rather than reflexively dismissing Saudi anxieties about the Iran-Houthi menace, critics should imagine what the United States would have done had the Soviet Union developed an alliance with a heavily armed, highly trained and well-funded Mexican militia at the height of the Cold War.Those who have a vested interest in the stability and prosperity of Saudi Arabia (and the region) should give due consideration to the depth and breadth of the challenges currently confronting the crown prince. They should, realize how essential it is that he succeed – not only for his country, but also for the world of Islam. Instead of delivering instinctive criticism, they should provide the crown prince with more substantive and realistic critiques.Taking such a constructive approach would, at the very least, be helpful in guiding Saudi leaders down what is a potentially treacherous but most urgent and necessary path."

Louise Slaughter's mark on Congress was evident, as staff and colleagues on both sides of the aisle remembered the longest-serving member of Congress from New York after news of her death broke Friday.Slaughter, a Democrat, died at the age of 88 after being hospitalized with a concussion, Fox News confirmed. She had served in Congress since 1987.The first female chair of the powerful House Rules Committee, Slaughter co-authored the Violence Against Women Act, was a founding member of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus and authored the STOCK Act, a 2012 law that prohibited insider trading in Congress.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., remembered Slaughter as a “trailblazer” who used her positions to “fight for women and working families in New York and across the country.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Slaughter was “a giant.”“She had deep convictions – on both issues important to the people of Rochester, and for the integrity and honesty of the political system,” he said in a statement. “Throughout her entire career, Louise worked with people from so many different philosophies and backgrounds, because she was such a genuine human spirit. The ferocity of her advocacy was matched only by the depth of her compassion and humanity.”Schumer continued, “Her passing will leave a gaping hole in our hearts and our nation.”  Slaughter ""was tough, unfailingly gracious, and unrelenting in fighting for her ideas,"" Ryan said. ""She was simply great."" ""Louise did not need a gavel to make a dent in history,"" Ryan also said. Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., said his friendship with Slaughter “went beyond politics,” especially as she counseled him during a “recent, deep personal loss.” Newhouse’s wife passed away in May just before their anniversary.“You could not find a sharper mind than Louise Slaughter,” remembered Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., on social media. “She was a truly great leader and I was honored to serve alongside her. Louise was a pioneer and a tireless voice for women.”Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-Maine, said she served with Slaughter on the House Rules Committee.“I knew her to be a tough-as-nails role model and extraordinary communicator,” Pingree said. “She was the House’s biggest champion against antibiotic misuse and a tireless fighter for the arts.”In a series of tweets, Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., remembered Slaughter as “amazing, sharp-tongued yet charming and brilliant.”“Her quick with and Southern drawl were irresistible,” Speier said, adding that she hopes Slaughter’s family “can take some small comfort in knowing the legacy Louise leaves behind will live on for generations to come.”“As we talked over dinner so many times, she would regale us with sure fire quips and clear eyed commentary about the political world,” Speier recalled. “Louise knew fake when she saw it and was not afraid to call it out. She knew truth when she saw it and stood strong in its defense. I loved her so.”Rep. Ann McLane Kuster, D-N.H., said Slaughter was her mentor and a “dear friend” to her mother.“She was a trailblazer for women lawmakers and will be truly missed,” she said.Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said she ""always felt so warmly welcomed by [Slaughter] and her entire staff."" ""Louise has served our state for over three decades, and has been a role model to many women Members, including myself,"" Stefanik said in a statement.

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/16/newt-gingrich-trump-and-his-success-continues-to-baffle-our-countrys-elites-whats-going-on.html","When President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Climate Agreement, the elites could not see how breaking with these bad agreements could possibly be good for Americans. After all, some of the Washington elites had helped draft these deals – which in the minds of the liberal media meant these deals must be good.As we have seen President Trump make changes to his Cabinet and personal staff, the elites in Washington and the national media have insisted that these decisions are a sign of dangerous instability in the White House. Never mind that the best business leaders and managers routinely make tough staffing decisions to improve their organizations’ long-run initiatives or mission. It seems the elites simply refuse to think about the Trump presidency through any lens other than that of traditional Washington – despite the fact that President Trump has never been a part of (and represents a departure from) the traditional establishment. This confused, square peg-round hole analytical approach is made worse by the fact that the elites then try to use Washington jargon to define and attack the president.The president doesn’t fit the traditional Republican free-trader mold because he demands that Americans must benefit from trade agreements. Therefore, according to the elites, he must be a protectionist.President Trump didn’t enter office with a team of politicos and policy wonks who had been with him through a decades-long political career, so to the elites insist the Trump administration is inexperienced.Finally, the president is not afraid to take decisive action when he’s made up his mind about something, so the elites claim he is unstable.However, many Americans hear these Washington words (isolationist, protectionist, inexperienced, unstable) and see no relationship to their president or his administration.Many Americans – who for years watched factories close and American prosperity dwindle as a result of bad multinational agreements and unfair trade deals – regard President Trump’s decision to get out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Paris Climate Agreement as necessary and long overdue. To them, the president has been working to break away from deals that help other countries at the expense of U.S. success – just as any good business executive would.Similarly, millions of Americans see the president taking actions to stop foreign countries that are cheating at trade as a sign that he is defending the interests of our country abroad. That’s also what good business leaders do.When President Trump replaces one of his team members with someone more in-tune with his vision, most Americans see him acting as a typical, goal-oriented executive.In “Understanding Trump,” I point out that our president defeated the media and Washington elite largely because they simply refused to understand him as a candidate. Further, they were profoundly wrong about the 2016 election because they couldn’t comprehend that the American people wanted something other than the traditional Washington elites’ idea of a president.It seems the elites didn’t read my book – or they didn’t take its lessons to heart – because they haven’t changed a bit. They still don’t understand Trump."

Jeff Flake blasted President Trump as an “erratic leader” in a closely-watched speech in New Hampshire on Friday, fueling more speculation that the Arizona Republican may challenge the president in a 2020 GOP primary.Asked during a Politics and Eggs appearance at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics if he will challenge Trump in 2020, Flake said “it has not been in my plans to run for president, but I have not ruled it out.”But he emphasized his belief that someone from his party will take on Trump in the GOP presidential primaries.The conservative senator, who’s retiring at the end of this year rather than face the prospect of losing a primary challenge if he ran for re-election, described himself Friday as “Americanus Nevertrumpus” and said ""somebody needs to stand up for traditional Republicanism.”Flake lamented the shape of his party under Trump.“As a political movement, we’ve been out of minds lately,” Flake said. “It’s like invasion of the body snatchers. What have we done with all the conservatives?”But the senator promised  “we will get through this and when we do, there will be much work to repair the damage. There will have to be an accounting of how we got here so that we may never find ourselves here again. There will have to be an American restoration.”Accusing Trump of coziness with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Flake said the United States should “not nod and wink at dictators. Nor will we congratulate them for the good job they're doing in their programs of extra-judicial killings. Nor will we host them in the Oval Office. Nor will we hesitate to punish them for attacking our elections.”Flake described the president as someone who “exudes chaos and dotes on authoritarians.” He also accused him of replacing “the State Department with Twitter” and said Trump “lives in a golden palace when he’s not in the White House.”Flake served 12 years in the U.S. House before winning election to the Senate in 2012. He would have faced a challenging battle to win re-nomination if he ran for re-election this year.But Flake told Fox News after his speech that the strong possibility of a primary defeat this year in Arizona didn’t negate his chances of taking on the President in the 2020 primaries.“Winning a primary in one state doesn’t determine what you can do nationwide,” he said.Flake admitted that a primary challenge against Trump would be a longshot, but that things could change down the road.“It’s certainly tough to see today. But if we continue to have elections like we saw in Pennsylvania, a plus-20 Trump district lost to a Democrat. If the midterms turn out on a similar path, then things change rapidly and I don’t think you can take for granted anything about next year and the year following. It’s a long way,” he told reporters.Asked by Fox News if it was coincidence that the president was showing up in New Hampshire three days after his visit, Flake answered “I doubt that it has anything to do with this visit.”Trump’s convincing win in the February 2016 New Hampshire GOP presidential primary gave him his first victory toward winning the nomination and eventually the White House.But two recent polls of New Hampshire Republicans indicated that there may be a growing appetite for a primary challenge.Former New Hampshire GOP vice chair Matt Mayberry said that “we welcome all primary challengers. No one gets a coronation. It’s not a done deal.”But conservative state representative David Bates of Windham said he didn’t think there was much of an appetite for a primary challenge, but acknowledged that “a lot can change. We’re awful early in the process.”Bates said that Flake's “whole message here was nothing but criticism of Trump essentially and it’s hard to understand how he’s proposing to rebuild the Republican Party by doing nothing more than launching criticism at the effective leader of the party right now.”"

They know they could be embarrassed in the next two hours because their boss is so mercurial.""Swan says he tries to be ""hyper-cautious"" and, as a scoop artist himself, ""I don't pretend I'm some bastion of glory. But there's only so many times you can write that H.R. McMaster is leaving the White House; at some point the story will be correct. I'd have to get it from Donald J. Trump himself.""People have read that story 15 times. What's the reader to think when he reads it for the 16th time?""That, of course, doesn't stop journalists from trying.It’s easy to dismiss all this as palace intrigue, and there is a media fixation on who's up and who's down. But in a very short time, Hope Hicks and Gary Cohn quit the White House, Trump fired Rex Tillerson and nominated Mike Pompeo as his successor, and tapped CNBC’s Larry Kudlow to replace Cohn as chief economic adviser.And while it's true that the press sometimes gives short shrift to policy, that is inextricably bound up with who’s giving the president advice and speaking on his behalf. Tillerson was ousted in part because of disagreements on Iran, Korea, Russia and Jerusalem, and Cohn resigned in part because of disagreements on steel and aluminum tariffs.With so much chatter, journalists are scrambling on several fronts.The Washington Post reported flatly last night that Trump ""has decided to remove H.R. McMaster,"" according to ""five people with knowledge of his plans.""CBS's Major Garrett reported yesterday that ""a purge is coming"" and that chief of staff Kelly ""may also be on the way out,"" along with ""up to three Cabinet secretaries.""Fox's chief White House correspondent John Roberts reported, starting Wednesday night: ""We don't know if these are going to happen, but we are told there could be a bloodbath"" by Thursday or Friday. That, he said would include:""H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, to be replaced by Ambassador John Bolton.""Another potential change coming up, VA Secretary David Shulkin out, to be replaced by Energy Secretary Rick Perry.""Another possible departure, it's rumored, this one may be further off, John Kelly, to potentially be replaced by OMB Director Mick Mulvaney.""But Sarah Huckabee Sanders threw cold water on the McMaster reports by tweeting last night that there will be ""no changes at the NSC.""At a photo op yesterday, the president was asked about upcoming staff changes.""Well, the story was very false,"" Trump said.

He did not specify which story he had in mind.But if it's true that ""in Trumpworld, nobody knows anything,"" all shakeup stories should be taken with many teaspoons of salt.

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/15/new-deplorables-democrats-duck-as-hillary-hits-backward-voters.html","The Democrats are gearing up for the midterms, emboldened by the apparent razor-thin win by Conor Lamb in a Pittsburgh-area district that Donald Trump carried by 20 points.And they are starting to maneuver for 2020, with the likes of Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Terry McAuliffe and others maneuvering to take the party past Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.And yet, again, here comes Hillary Clinton.Which, not to put too fine a point on it, takes us back to one of the worst moments of her campaign, going after the deplorables.It's one thing to attack Trump, the man who beat her in the Electoral College. It's another to denigrate his voters.""I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward,"" Clinton said. ""And his whole campaign — 'Make America Great Again' — was looking backward. You know, you didn't like black people getting rights, you don't like women, you know, getting jobs, you don't want, you know, to see that Indian-American succeeding more than you are. Whatever your problem is, I'm going to solve it.""Let's unpack that for a minute. Trump voters were looking backward. They don't want black people to have rights. They don't want women getting jobs.Really? Does Clinton not have a sense of how condescendingly awful that sounds?Does she believe that's why she lost Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania? Not that Trump appealed to struggling working-class voters, but that his supporters resent women, blacks and legal immigrants?There was more. Clinton suggested white women voted for Trump because of ""ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son, whoever, believes you should.""Seriously? While that may have happened in certain instances, does the first female presidential nominee of a major party believe that women are that ... subservient? I sure don't.Hillary's party is not happy with this latest flashback.""Even the staunchest Clinton allies as well as longtime advisers say the comments were cringeworthy and ultimately detrimental to Democrats,"" says The Hill.Missouri’s Claire McCaskill told the Washington Post these were ""fighting words"":""I think they were expressing their frustration with the status quo. I may not have agreed with their choice, but I certainly respect them. And I don’t think that's the way you should talk about any voter, especially ones in my state.""Ohio's Sherrod Brown told the Huffington Post: ""I don't really care what she said. I just think that that's not helpful.""Hillary Clinton is entitled to say whatever she wants. She doesn't have to quiet down just because she’s frustrating other Democrats.But this is an unfortunate throwback to the comments she made in the fall of 2016:""You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic—you name it.""That led some Trump backers to proudly identify themselves as deplorables.Hillary Clinton blew a winnable election, but she did win the popular vote. Does she want to be remembered for disdaining the middle of the country?"
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/14/trump-fires-tillerson-for-irreconcilable-differences-as-media-predicted-months-ago.html","On the last day of November, the New York Times ran a story headlined ""White House Plans Tillerson Ouster From State Dept., to Be Replaced by Pompeo.""President Trump objected to that and other reports, tweeting:""The media has been speculating that I fired Rex Tillerson or that he would be leaving soon – FAKE NEWS! He's not leaving and while we disagree on certain subjects, (I call the final shots) we work well together and America is highly respected again!""So while it may have been premature news, it wasn't fake news.That Times piece was attributed to ""senior administration officials,"" and said Tillerson would be out ""perhaps within the next several weeks.""As recently as Monday, the Times reported, ""a White House spokesman berated a reporter for suggesting there was any kind of split between Mr. Tillerson and the White House because of disparate comments on Russian responsibility for a poison attack in Britain.""It's been obvious for many months that the two men had a tenuous relationship. The former Exxon Mobil chief, who was used to calling the shots and had no government experience, also seemed not to have control of the State Department bureaucracy.And Tillerson never really seemed at ease in a public role. He did few interviews and almost never held news conferences. The country has very little sense of him as a person or a diplomat.And of course there was the NBC story last October, which Tillerson never denied although a spokesman did, that he had privately called Trump a ""moron.""That same month, Trump tweeted that he told Tillerson ""that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man ... Save your energy Rex, we'll do what has to be done!""When the president last week announced that he would meet with Kim Jong-un-right after Tillerson said there would be no negotiations—it was clear that the secretary was in bureaucratic Siberia. And Trump wanted to make a change before the North Korea summit.And Tillerson made no attempt to play along with some blather about a mutual agreement. Although the Post said John Kelly told him Friday that Trump wanted to make a change, Tillerson seemed unaware as he cut short his visit to Africa that the time had come. He had Steve Goldstein, his undersecretary for public diplomacy, put out a statement saying ""the secretary had every intention of staying because of the critical progress made in national security and other areas"" and was ""unaware"" of the reason for his firing.The White House promptly fired Goldstein, who undoubtedly would have left anyway as the new secretary hires his team.  Fourteen months is a short tenure for the top Cabinet member, but the president has every right to make a change, given their disagreements on Russia, Iran and North Korea. ""I think Rex will be much happier now,"" Trump said.In Pompeo, Trump is getting a former congressman who seems much more aligned with his views and, more important, has far better chemistry with his boss."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/13/backlash-media-folks-back-chuck-todd-after-trump-calls-him-sob.html","The Pennsylvania crowd loved it when President Trump took a whack at Chuck Todd.But cursing out the moderator of ""Meet the Press"" was beneath the president.If Trump wants to challenge Todd over something he said or reported, he has every right to do that. I've just published a book arguing that the coverage of this president has been overwhelmingly negative in ways that fuels an erosion of trust in the mainstream media.What does this do for the president other than rouse his supporters, who don't like or respect the media? They already love him. Such vulgarities do nothing to win over moderates or independents who are lukewarm toward Trump.What makes the crack particularly surprising is that Trump and Todd actually have an off-the-record relationship. As I report in my book ""Media Madness,"" the president has had him to the White House for private meetings. These generally begin with Trump yelling at Chuck over something he or NBC did, and Chuck yelling back, before they settle down to a civil conversation.Conservative radio host and MSNBC analyst Hugh Hewitt called Todd a ""great reporter"" and said Trump ""only slams those he is afraid of. He should sit down w/ CT on camera, not sling insults.""Anthony Scaramucci, the short-lived communications director, offered his former boss some advice in an interview with MSNBC's Kasie Hunt: ""When he's tweeting at journalists, as an example, I would tell him, 'Hey, let’s not do that.' I think we made a very big mistake early on in the administration when Steve Bannon declared war on the media. I thought that was a very bad idea.""In an interview with Politico a day before the rally, Todd described how businessman Trump would phone him when he was first contemplating a White House run:""For a long time, he used to call me up and be upset because I wasn't taking the idea of him running for president seriously in 2011. And we would have these half-hour conversations regularly, and I would sit there—and I remember one time with Savannah Guthrie and I, we, literally put him on mute, going, 'Does he have other things to do but call?'""Since ""The Apprentice"" was running on NBC, Todd said, Trump once called him and said, ""'Come on, we’re colleagues. I make you a lot of money.' I'm like, 'What?'""In that conversation with Politico's Susan Glasser, Todd said Trump has been ""shooting from the hip,"" ignoring advisers while going ""by his gut,"" and bashing the media while ""begging for compliments"" from them.On Sunday morning, Trump unloaded on New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, who covered him for years in New York and probably knows him better than any other political journalist.Haberman co-authored a story saying Trump was in discussions with a lawyer about joining the White House to help with the Bob Mueller investigation.Trump tweeted that the ""failing"" NYT ""purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team."" But the story didn’t say that. It said that chief lawyer Ty Cobb has told people he expects to leave soon and Trump ""has seesawed between expressing confidence in Mr. Cobb’s claim that the inquiry will wrap up in relatively short order and that he will be exonerated, and sounding frustrated with his team’s legal strategy.""The president also tweeted that ""the writer of the story, Maggie Haberman, a Hillary flunky, knows nothing about me and is not given access.""Haberman responded with a tweeted ""LOL,"" but the ""no access"" part is demonstrably untrue, given that she has interviewed the president a number of times. In fact, he called her a year ago to say he was pulling his original ObamaCare replacement bill.In a subsequent interview, Trump told Haberman in a light tone that she had been accused of being ""Hillary Clinton's PR person.""""Mostly by you,"" Haberman shot back.In yet another interview, the president caused a stir by telling Haberman and two colleagues that Jeff Sessions had been ""very unfair"" by signing on as attorney general and then recusing himself in the Russia probe.The bottom line is that Trump is entitled to bitch about his largely negative coverage. But calling journalists that word, or other choice expletives, hurts his stature more than theirs."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/09/stormy-weather-can-lawyers-attempt-to-silence-porn-star-hurt-president.html","Let’s start with the premise that the Stormy Daniels saga hasn’t gotten much traction because most Americans don’t care about it.The alleged relationship happened a decade ago, it was said to be consensual, the public knew about Donald Trump’s playboy lifestyle and the “Access Hollywood” tape. So what did or didn’t happen in 2006 is hardly in the same league as Bill Clinton, as president, having a sexual relationship with an intern and lying about it.But now it’s become a real-time melodrama, with allegations of hush money payments and attempts to silence the former porn star.Now it’s become a legal issue as well as a political one.Trump’s private lawyer, Michael Cohen, is trying to suppress Stormy’s story right now.Daniels did her part under the non-disclosure agreement and stayed quiet. When the story bubbled up again this year, Cohen put out a statement on her behalf denying any affair and any hush-money agreement.Unfortunately for Daniels, she had described the supposed affair in great detail in a 2011 interview with In Touch magazine, which belatedly decided to publish it. The magazine has never explained why it didn’t run the story at the time, though there have been reports of legal threats from the Trump side.None of this has been good for Stormy’s credibility. But now she claims she wants to tell the truth—and has sued the president to void the non-disclosure deal on the grounds that he never signed it.We have learned, based on a New York Times story yesterday, that Cohen secretly sought a restraining order last week to keepDaniels from speaking out. So this is no longer a matter of the ancient past.Stormy’s lawyer, Michael Avenatti, has been on a television blitz. He said on “Today” that the $130,000 payment was an effort to “silence” Daniels and that “there’s no question the president knew about it at the time. The idea that an attorney would go off on his own, without his client’s knowledge and engage in this negotiation and enter this type of agreement is ludicrous.”At Wednesday, briefing, Sanders pointed out that the president has denied having an affair with Daniels and that she was not aware whether Trump knew of the payment. She added that “this case has already been won in arbitration, and there was no knowledge of any payments from the president, and he has denied all these allegations.”The reference to having “won” the case is based on a statement from Cohen’s lawyer that an arbitrator found that Daniels “violated the agreement.” But Avenatti, who doesn’t consider the ruling final, likened that claim to Trump having won the Electoral College.Ultimately there could be a campaign-finance law violation if the 130K was paid for the purpose of influencing the election by muzzling Stormy Daniels.I’m well aware that many people dismiss this as tabloid trash, along with the allegations from the same period by Karen McDougal, a former Playboy playmate who was paid $150,000 by the National Enquirer in 2016 when she was threatening to disclose an affair with Trump.I don’t really care what Trump did in his personal life as a businessman. So many other stories, from tariffs to guns to immigration, are more important.But right now we have an ongoing attempt by the president’s lawyer to silence a former X-rated film actress and an unexplained six-figure payoff that smells like hush money. No wonder this story isn’t going away."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/08/tiff-over-tariffs-gary-cohn-gets-heros-sendoff-from-media.html","The mainstream media are heartsick over the departure of Gary Cohn.As the president’s chief economic adviser heads for the exits, the framing of most stories—not to mention the continuation of the “chaos” narrative—is that this development is truly bad news for the White House.That comes against the backdrop of coverage that Trump’s sudden move to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum is a wrong-headed decision that has greatly upset Paul Ryan and the Republican Party.The tariff plan may be smart or self-defeating. And it’s certainly created a political storm. But why should Trump be pilloried for keeping a campaign promise, just because the former head of Goldman Sachs was opposed?This is not a knock on Cohn, who brought stature to the administration. There is little doubt that his battle against tariffs was a last stand for him and that he felt blindsided by the move, even leaving aside his request that the president give him a bigger job. (It’s hard to imagine he wanted to be chief of staff, despite reports that Trump was considering him if he wanted to replace John Kelly).So how is the Cohn resignation playing?Politico’s headline includes an anonymous quote that the departure will be a “disaster”: “The number of bad ideas that have come though this White house that were thankfully killed dead — there are too many to count,” an unnamed White House official says. “With Gary gone, I just think, from a policy perspective, it means disaster.”Politico says that “Cohn joins the long list of policy experts who have departed in recent months — a brain drain that leaves the president with fewer people around him who know how to get policy made, and how to stop Trump from moving ahead with unworkable ideas.“Some worry the White House could return to the uncontrolled days immediately following Trump’s inauguration, when many West Wing jobs were still unfilled and former strategist Steve Bannon was writing executive orders with policy adviser Stephen Miller.”Let’s just say Bannon’s departure wasn’t covered with quite the same tone.The Washington Post says that “the departure of Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs who had been an interlocutor between the Trump administration and the business community, is the latest jolt to a White House that has been especially tumultuous in recent weeks and unable to retain some of its top talent.“His resignation as National Economic Council director will leave the White House without a financial heavyweight who business executives and foreign leaders believed had served as a counter to Trump’s protectionist impulses and as a moderating force in other areas.”This is an important story because, as the New York Times says, “trade has always been the iron curtain that divided Mr. Trump and establishment Republicans.”The consensus among economists is that however many jobs may be saved in steel and aluminum, about triple that number will be lost in industries that rely on these imports.But that is, in a nutshell, the free trade argument that has been resented for decades by workers in manufacturing who care more about their struggling industries than the overall health of the global economy. And making the populist case against such agreements helps explain how Trump won Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and thus the presidency.Gary Cohn is a Wall Street guy. He may be right about this issue. But he doesn’t have to run for reelection in 2020, and the tariffs he fought play very well with the president’s base. "

I believe with every ounce of my body that the future of our country, and a better life for our children, requires the implementation of the America First agenda.I am confident I would have won the US Senate race and done a great job representing the people of Nevada in the Senate, but the President is adamant that a unified Republican ticket in Nevada is the best direction for the America First movement.

Jeff Flake (R-AZ) delivered a speech in New Hampshire on Friday morning in which he called for a primary challenge to President Donald Trump in 2020 and criticized the Republican Party.Speaking at the “Politics and Eggs” breakfast at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, Flake, who did not vote for Trump in 2016, began by declaring: “I stand before you today, the rarest of species: the American conservative, Americanus nevertrumpus.”He said that the very meaning of the word “conservative” had been gutted during the Trump administration, and true conservatives — like himself — had been discarded.“We have a libertine, budget-busting president who exudes chaos and dotes on authoritarians, who’s replaced the State Department with Twitter, who lives in a golden palace when he’s not in the White House, and he’s the conservative.“Just for argument’s sake, I grew up busting broncs and castrating bulls. My wife cuts my hair because I’m too cheap to go to a barber … I killed earmarks while in the house, scored a perfect 100 with the Club for Growth, and have a lifetime rating of 94 with the American Conservative Union. And I’m the RINO. … It’s like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. What have we done with all the conservatives?”Flake announced his retirement from the Senate last October, faced with polls that showed he could not win re-election in Arizona.In New Hampshire, he accused fellow Republicans of “defining deviancy down” by tolerating President Trump’s rhetorical excesses.He also called the Trump administration “an anomalous presidency.”“‘Pay attention to what he does, not what he says,’ people say. Those calls, of course, ignore the entirety of American history and exhort us to adopt a new norm to accommodate undignified public behavior just for this one president.”He accused the president of threatening the independence of the judiciary, and of the integrity of law enforcement. And he accused conservatives who support Trump of “a rejection of the optimistic vision of Ronald Reagan, the extraordinary decency of George H.W. Bush, the principled constitutionalism of Barry Goldwater.” And he accused Republicans of putting party before country, saying that the party had abandoned its principles faster “than anyone has before.”Flake attacked Trump for several recent comments, including his claim that Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) — who has repeatedly called for the president’s impeachment — has a “low  IQ.” He accused Trump of “swinging insults like a bad comic at a cheap roast.”“My party does not deserve to lead,” he said, if Republicans tolerate Trump’s mannerisms.During a question-and-answer session that followed his speech, Flake said he was not planning to run or president, but that he had not ruled it out.“I hope that someone does run in the Republican primary, somebody to challenge the president. I think the Republicans want to be reminded what it means to be a traditional, decent Republican, and what the party stands for: limited government, economic freedom, free trade, embracing immigration — these are the things that have made the party what it is, over the years.”One member of the audience, challenging Flake to live up to his own motto, “Look for the good,” asked the senator to identify good things Trump had done.Flake’s answer: in negotiations over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Trump offered a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal aliens.He did not mention tax cuts, judicial appointments, or foreign policy successes.Joel B.

He also rejected ubiquitous news media and political narratives framing Special Counsel Robert Mueller as a man of integrity.Limbaugh described Washington-based political and bureaucratic interests as broadly desiring an ousting of Trump from the presidency:They want Trump gone. They want everybody anything to do with Trump gone. They all do. Everybody at the State Department, everybody in this immediate FBI circle with Rosenstein, Murphy, and McKinnon, the Republican establishment community, Republican consultants, they want Trump gone. Mueller is the guy to do it. Mueller is carrying the water for the entire establishment in getting Trump gone. And they don’t care how they do it. And I think their objective is to ruin him.Limbaugh accused Mueller of seeking to “nullify” Trump’s 1995 IRS claim of approximately $900 million in operational losses in order to pursue a reclamation of the money with added penalties and accrued interest:And these requests, the subpoena for documents from the Trump Organization, I ask you again, what has that to do with the campaign and with collusion and with the Russians? They’ve already been looking into Trump business in Russia with the Miss, what is it, USA, whatever his pageant is.Do you all remember during the early days of the campaign there was news that Trump, in a tax return something like 20 years ago, took a $900 million deduction that was granted and survived an audit by the IRS? Now, I forget the details. It had to do with losses that he had incurred in that year in building things. It was around 900 or $920 million deduction. I’ll never forget when it was reported because most people will never come close to ever having that in a lifetime, and to have a guy personally write that much off?…Anyway, I think Mueller wants that $920 million back. I think Mueller wants to prove that that was a faulty deduction. I think that they want to go back, they want to get Trump’s tax returns because they want to nullify that $900 million deduction, and then they want to collect 20 years of interest and penalties and wipe Trump out.Limbaugh also challenged the pervasive framing of Mueller as an honorable man across the joint news media and political landscape:We’ve been told as long as I have been aware of the name Robert Mueller, we are told that Mr. Mueller is a man of impeccable character, a man of refined tastes, a man of immense sophistication and qualification. The man was a judge, he ran the FBI, he is a fair person. He’s an all-round good guy. And in terms of people in Washington when it comes to the integrity, there are none with any more integrity than Robert Mueller.Well, I’m sorry, but that doesn’t fit with what we see this man doing. And what I ask myself is, does Mueller ever get up and ask himself, “What the hell am I doing? I don’t have a crime here. I don’t have any evidence of a crime.” Does Mueller ever get up or does anybody on his team, do they get up in the morning and they ever ask themselves, are we really doing the right thing here in seeking to destroy an American citizen whose only audacious behavior is winning the presidency?A man of honor and integrity, suggested Limbaugh, would not accept a limitless role to pursue the political destruction of President Donald Trump: “There aren’t any limits on this guy! There is no crime that he has been charged with investigating. He’s been given a free rein to go find a crime anywhere he wants!”“We’re told this guy’s the best of the best,” said Limbaugh. “We’re told this guy, nobody could hold a candle to him in terms of honesty and integrity and character. Well, then how does somebody with all of those fine traits even participate in a sham like this?”Mueller’s mandate to “investigate Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and related matters” — issued by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein — lists no financial or temporal limitations.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/16/consumer-sentiment-hits-highest-level-since-2004/","Consumers sentiment rose in early March to its highest level since 2004, according to the University of Michigan’s survey.The jump in the University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment to 102 from 99.7 in February was due to a new all-time record in favorable assessments of current conditions. The best of times are here again.The survey has a very populist twist. All of the gains in the index were due to improvements in the feelings of households with incomes in the bottom third. Households in the top third posted a significant monthly decline, mostly due to falling views of the outlook for the economy and their personal finances. This could be an indication of who expects to gain and who expects to lose from the Trump administration’s tax policies and its newfound aggressiveness on trade issues.“In early March, favorable mentions of tax reform were offset by unfavorable references to the tariffs on steel and aluminum,” the survey’s chief economist, Richard Curtin, said in a statement.There were some indications of rising inflation signals. Near-term inflation expectations jumped to their highest level in years, although this is somewhat offset by the fact that expected increase in incomes dropped.“Among the top-third income households, income expectations fell more and inflation expectations rose more,” Curtin said.As higher-income households account for more than half of all consumption spending,  that could prove a drag on consumption, Curtin notes. This might explain some of the recent slowdown in consumer spending despite blowout employment numbers.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Dan Donovan (R-NY) declared, “When I saw articles on the issues of child sex dolls abroad, I knew I had to act immediately to stop the proliferation of them within the United States.”As reported by the Weekly Standard, Donovan “has proposed the Curbing Realistic Exploitative Electronic Pedophilic Robots (CREEPER) Act to ban their import and make possession of them illegal,” citing his career of “locking up pedophiles.”“Every case has stayed with me — there is no situation where a child was hurt or victimized that doesn’t leave your thoughts,” Donovan proclaimed, adding, “I will do everything possible to stop crimes against children.”“These dolls are being shipped here now. The ability to obtain child sex dolls needs to be stopped immediately,” he continued. “You don’t give an alcoholic a bottle of liquor… Once a child sex abuser tires of practicing on a doll, it’s a small step to move on to an innocent child.”Donovan’s proposed CREEPER Act has received thirty-one co-sponsors, while a Change.org petition supporting the proposed bill has also received 163,000 signatures.The dolls are largely imported from Asian countries, such as Japan.Child sex dolls are illegal to import into the United Kingdom, with Border Force officers reportedly seizing 123 dolls in just over a year, however, some therapists have advocated for the prescription of sex dolls to pedophiles in an attempt to lower offense rates.Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/16/ohio-judge-blocks-abortion-ban-down-syndrome-babies/","An Obama-appointed federal judge has blocked an Ohio law banning selective abortions that target babies diagnosed with Down syndrome.“Federal law is crystal clear,” wrote Judge Timothy S. Black of the U.S. District Court for Southern Ohio in a 22-page ruling granting a preliminary injunction against the state.Black — who has a reputation as a stridently liberal judge — wrote that the Ohio law “wrongfully” prohibits women from making the ultimate decision to terminate a pregnancy before viability. “It violates the right to privacy of every woman in Ohio and is unconstitutional on its face,” he added.Ohio Gov. John Kasich signed the “Down Syndrome Non-Discrimination Act” into law last December, banning selective abortions performed on babies diagnosed with Trisomy 21, or Down syndrome.The act, also known as House Bill 214, amended Ohio law to “prohibit a person from performing, inducing, or attempting to perform or induce an abortion on a pregnant woman who is seeking the abortion because an unborn child has or may have Down Syndrome.”“While every unborn child deserves protection from abortion death, House Bill 214 is helpful in protecting those targeted for destruction due to cultural bigotry against babies identified before birth as ‘abnormal’ or ‘imperfect’ due to a Down Syndrome prediction,” noted Cincinnati Right to Life at the time.The law would have taken effect March 23, but Black’s ruling prevents the state from enforcing the law until the case is decided.“It’s a tragedy that the court prioritized abortion-on-demand over special-needs children. Our pro-life law simply ensured that Ohioans with Down syndrome would be protected against lethal discrimination. Unfortunately, the ACLU and the abortion industry callously disregarded these Ohioans,” said Mike Gonidakis, president of Ohio Right to Life, who vowed that the battle is not over.“Luckily, we have pro-life Attorney General Mike DeWine who will fiercely defend our law in order to protect our special-needs community. This isn’t the end. This is just the beginning.”During his eight years as president, Barack Obama consistently named only pro-abortion judges, and he never earned less than a 100 percent approval rating from either NARAL Pro-Choice America or Planned Parenthood. During his first four-year term, in fact, Obama named two former Planned Parenthood officials as federal judges, appointing former Planned Parenthood board member Morgan Christen to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals and former Planned Parenthood director John McConnell as a federal judge in Rhode Island.The effects of these appointments on abortion law have been made evident in a series of recent decisions.For example, in 2016, Indiana passed a state law banning gender-selective abortions and those based on a prenatal diagnosis of disabilities such as Down syndrome, but the law was blocked by another Obama-appointed federal judge following a lawsuit brought by abortion giant Planned Parenthood.U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Walton Pratt issued a permanent injunction against Indiana’s “Sex Selective and Disability Abortion Ban,” claiming that provisions of the law “violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.”In her decision, Judge Pratt defended sex-selective and disability-based abortions, stating that “it is a woman’s right to choose an abortion that is protected, which, of course, leaves no room for the State to examine, let alone prohibit, the basis or bases upon which a woman makes her choice.”“The right to a pre-viability abortion is categorical,” regardless of the particular motivation that impels a woman to seek it, Pratt declared.In his ruling, Black echoed the reasoning employed by Judge Pratt.“The state cannot dictate what factors a woman is permitted to consider in making her choice,” he wrote, saying that the Ohio law “violates a woman’s right to choose, in clear derogation of federal law.”The case will now go to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, one of the most conservative appeals courts in the nation.“The Sixth Circuit’s current conservative orientation is … due in large part to President Donald Trump’s having already appointed three judges to it,” said Breitbart News’s senior legal editor, Ken Klukowski, who served as a law clerk to the former chief judge of the Sixth Circuit, Judge Alice Batchelder.“No federal appeals court in the nation has seen more confirmed appointments than the Sixth Circuit (and is soon to be followed by a fourth nominee pending in the Senate, as well as a fifth nomination expected soon),” Klukowski said, adding, “The Sixth Circuit shows how consistent President Trump has been in keeping his campaign promise to appoint originalist judges who follow the Constitution as it is written.”The case is Preterm Cleveland v. Himes, No. 1:18-cv-109, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsromeMOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

These encounters were surely sanctioned in some way by Fusion’s client, the Clinton campaign. The sessions were off the record, but because Steele has since disclosed having participated in them I can confirm that I attended one of them. Despite Steele’s generally cool manner, he seemed distraught about the Russians’ role in the election. He did not distribute his dossier, provided no documentary evidence, and was so careful about guarding his sources that there was virtually no way to follow up. At the time, neither the New Yorker nor any other news organization ran a story about the allegations.The meetings at the Tabard Inn were not previously reported.The New Yorker is not the first news organization to admit to being briefed by Steele.Last month, the Washington Post for the first time detailed two meetings the newspaper reported it held with Steele. At least one of the meetings was also attended by Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn R. Simpson. The meetings took place in September and October of 2016.The Post wrote that it “made efforts to independently confirm Steele’s information at the time, but was unable to corroborate his specific findings and did not publish stories based on the material.”The Post reported on meetings with other news outlets:Around the same time, Steele also met with other news organizations including the New York Times, the New Yorker and Yahoo News, according to court filings. In an article published on Sept. 23, 2016, Yahoo chief investigative correspondent Michael Isikoff reported that U.S. officials had received “intelligence reports” alleging that (Carter) Page had met with Igor Sechin, executive chairman of the Russian energy corporation Rosneft, while in Moscow in July — a finding of Steele’s research. Page has denied meeting with Sechin but later acknowledged interacting with one of his deputies.The Post did not make clear whether during the time of its meetings the newspaper was aware that Fusion GPS was being paid to conduct the firm’s anti-Trump work on behalf of both Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The newspaper first reported on those financial arrangements in October 2017.A four-page House Intelligence Committee memo alleging abuse of surveillance authority revealed that Steele had been terminated as an FBI source after the agency discovered he had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media about his relationship with the FBI in an October 30, 2016 article published by Mother Jones. The memo cites court filings in which Steele admitted to meetings with other news outlets. The memo also cited Steele’s meeting with Yahoo News, as related in a court filing.When Buzzfeed published Steele’s full dossier on January 10, 2017, the website related the information had been “circulating among elected officials, intelligence agents and journalists for weeks.” Later in the article, the website stated the dossier information had circulated for “months.”Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

The flights will take around seven hours and five minutes, and fly over… Saudi airspace,” airline spokesman Praveen Bhatnagar told AFP.The new route was announced by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last July, with Netanyahu first suggesting in January the route could pass over Saudi Arabia.Riyadh has no official ties with Tel Aviv, with Israel’s national carrier El Al currently taking a detour over the Red Sea on its India service to avoid Saudi and Iranian airspace.Netanyahu told reporters in Washington earlier this month that Air India had reached an agreement with Saudi Arabia for the route.The airline’s spokesman at the time confirmed the launch schedule for a thrice-a-week service from New Delhi to Tel Aviv but couldn’t confirm the exact route.– ‘Common challenges’ –Flying over Saudi Arabia significantly shortens the flight time over the proposed route.Riyadh has maintained public silence about suggestions the kingdom has covert relations with Israel, but Netanyahu said earlier this month in Washington that Israel and the Arab states have “never been closer”.“Most of the states in our region know — they know very well, believe me — that Israel is not their enemy, but their indispensible ally in confronting our common challenges and seizing our common opportunities,” Netanyahu also said at a public event in the US capital.Modi became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel last year, and has pushed for investment, technology cooperation and closer defence ties between the two countries.Saudi Arabia and its immediate neighbourhood is also strategically important for India as the major source of the country’s energy imports.The wider region also hosts millions of Indian migrant workers who send billions of dollars in remittances each year.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

In fact, some well-wired House Democrats predict she will be forced aside after the election and replaced by a younger, less divisive Dem,” Mike Allen wrote at Axios on Thursday.Politics in Washington D.C. remains, as always, driven by messaging, money, and numbers, and some of those numbers may no longer be adding up for Pelosi.Twenty-three is the number that matters in the immediate aftermath of Lamb’s victory in Pennsylvania–that’s the net gain of House seats the Democrats need in November 2018 to retake the majority.It has been long assumed that if the Democrats take back the House in the fall election, Pelosi, who served as Speaker from January 2007 to January 2011, and who has served as Minority Leader since January 2011, would automatically be selected by her colleagues as the new Speaker in the 116th Congress that convenes in January 2019.But Conor Lamb’s announcement that he will not support her as party leader may have changed that.“Dems point out the members and candidates can distance themselves from their leader for political reasons, but then ultimately vote for her,” Allen noted.“She could win the caucus vote [for Speaker] easily but lose the floor vote,” an ally of Pelosi told Allen, adding:“[I]f Dems win the majority by, say, a 10-vote majority, and 15 newly elected Dems have committed not to vote for her [like Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania] for leader of the party, … she could lose the floor vote for Speaker. That would give the House to the head of the Republicans.”“She would never let that happen, and she would bow out to someone else.”After Lamb’s win, Pelosi ” dodged reporters’ questions regarding whether Democrats running for Congress in 2018 should run against her leadership on Thursday,” NTK Network reported:Democrat Conor Lamb, who won Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district special election on Tuesday, was successful in part because of a direct-to-camera ad in which he said he would not support Pelosi as leader of the House Democratic caucus.A reporter asked Pelosi whether other Democrats should do the same thing.“I don’t think that he ran against me the entire time. I think he ran on his positive agenda,” Pelosi responded. “It was a very issues-oriented campaign.”“I just wanted him to win,” Pelosi said. “I don’t think that that had that much impact on the race. He won. If we hadn’t won, he might have a question, but we won. We won the race. The ‘D’ next to his name was very significant in those blue parts.”Three special Congressional elections remain to be resolved. Two of them–Ohio–12 and Arizona-8–will be held before the November general election. The third, Michigan-13, will be held on the same day as the November general election.The April 24 special election in Arizona’s 8th Congressional District to replace Rep. Trent Franks (R-AZ), who resigned in the midst of a scandal, pits Republican nominee Debbie Lesko against Democratic nominee Hiral Tipirneni in this district that is rated “Safe Republican.”Arizona-8 has little in common with PA-18, and Democratic nominee Tipirneni appears to have more in common with Nancy Pelosi than with Conor Lamb.“The area has not gone to a Democrat since 1980, though before the 2012 elections it was known as the 2nd District. The lines were redrawn when population growth gave Arizona an eighth seat in Congress,” Courthouse News reported in February, adding:Tipirneni, an immigrant from India, found a love for science and medicine as a young girl and eventually received her medical degree from Northeast Ohio Medical University.She is endorsed by former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who survived a 2011 assassination attempt in Tucson that left six dead, and who represented the 8th District before it was redrawn.Tipirneni wants to treat gun violence as a public health issue, supports reproductive rights, and hopes to reform immigration and veteran services. “Arizona Republican Party Chairman Jonathan Lines called Lesko a shoo-in for the April election,” Courthouse News reported:“I am confident that she will win the special election over whichever Nancy Pelosi Democrat emerges from the primary,” Lines said in an interview. “Debbie is an incredibly hard worker, she fights for her constituents, and never ever takes anything or anyone for granted.”While Tipirneni seems unlikely to reject Pelosi as Lamb did, the eventual Democratic nominee in Ohio’s 12th Congressional District, which has much more in common with PA-18, might be more likely to follow Lamb’s example.“Ohio’s 12th Congressional District opened for the first time since 2000, after Rep. Patrick Tiberi (R) resigned to lead the Ohio Business Roundtable.The primary election will occur on May 8, 2018, the same day as the state’s regularly scheduled primaries, while the special general election will occur on August 7, 2018. The winner of this special election will serve for five months until January 2019, unless also elected in the regularly scheduled November general election,” Ballotpedia reported.The political positioning of the winner of that May 8 Democratic primary in the run up to the August 7 special general election will indicate whether or not the Lamb strategy of repudiating Pelosi is likely to be followed by other Democratic candidates in the November 2018 general elections.Those candidates who are likely to do so will probably come from Congressional Districts in those Blue states President Trump won in 2016–Pennsylvania (like Lamb), Michigan, Wisconsin–and swing states, like Ohio, that have similar characteristics.Should 15 or so Democrats running in districts currently held by Republicans adopt the strategy of repudiating Nancy Pelosi, and should they be elected in an election that re-establishes a Democrat majority in the House of Representatives, the next obvious question will be this:Will they honor their campaign promises and vote against Nancy Pelosi as speaker in January 2019?The long history of broken political campaign promises on both sides of the aisle suggests the answer to that question may be one of the great unknowns of the 2018 midterm elections.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/16/delingpole-kudlow-pompeo-trumps-picks-just-get-better-and-better/","Larry Kudlow’s appointment as President Trump’s next Economic Czar has been anti-endorsed by at least two of my favorite foaming leftists.Here’s Jonathan Chait in New York Mag:Trump’s New Economic Adviser Lawrence Kudlow Has Been Wrong About Everything for DecadesHere’s Soros-funded Think Progress:Trump’s new economics director is a climate denier who thinks animals can ‘snuggle’ under pipelines.Could there be any more encouraging a sign that with his latest appointments, Trump is right over the target?I wrote the other day that Mike Pompeo was a great choice for Secretary of State – way better than the corporatist swamp denizen Rex Tillerson. But I think I’m even more excited about Kudlow.First, it means that the battle for the soul of the Trump administration’s economic policy has been won by the Art-Laffer-style supply siders. (This was by no means a given: remember all those GOP experts who told us in the early days that Trump was just a Democrat wearing Republican clothing…?).Second, Kudlow – like Pompeo, unlike their respective predecessors Tillerson and Gary Cohn – is a climate change skeptic.Here, for example, is Kudlow in April last year, totally getting why Trump had to pull the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord:“So Trump is saying, ‘I’m here to defend America, and we are going to continue our explorations and our technology. We’re going to strive for clean coal, we’re going keep natural gas fracking, we’re going to keep oil, etc.’ The market loves that because the market wants growth,” Kudlow said.Climate skepticism, it should be stressed, is not a marginal issue of relevance only to a few obsessives. It’s the touchstone, politically and intellectually, for pretty much everything that matters.If you are a climate skeptic, it almost inevitably follows that you are: not a victim of groupthink; open-minded; well-informed; intellectually curious; a believer in empiricism and the scientific method; a foe of government waste; brave; economically astute (because ultimately it’s about money, not science); politically bold (because for politicians going against “the Consensus” is still much the easier, more career-safe path).Trump hasn’t always got his appointments right first time. (Personally, I think Cohn and Tillerson were not remotely what the base was looking for when they voted Trump). But one of the many impressive – and underrated – qualities of the President is his ability to learn from and correct his mistakes.Also, because he’s a maverick who no more belongs to the GOP Establishment than he does to the Democrats or anyone else, he makes far, far braver decisions than any more conventional Republican would ever have done.I’m reminded of a conversation I had with one of Trump’s transition team back in December 2016, after Trump had won the presidency but before he took office.He said:“If any of the more conventional Republican candidates had won this presidential race, they would all have backtracked and disappointed on the climate issue. Trump’s different. Trump means it.”One of these days, historians might get round to acknowledging Trump as one of the greats. Till then, those of us who supported him early in the day, when it was still unfashionable, will just have to do with the satisfaction of knowing we’re right.

His tools were also confiscated in the incident.Defending himself during a hearing, the bodyguard claimed he had done the “minimum necessary” to “restrain” the workman after he was caught taking the photos.Princess Hussat is King Salman’s only daughter out of his 11 children. She fled the country shortly after the incident, it was reported.The news also coincides with a report from NBC News on Thursday that U.S. officials believe Salman has been hiding his mother from his father King Salman, with her whereabouts currently unknown.Over the years, the Prince has used multiple stories for his mother’s absence, which include claims she was receiving medical treatment abroad in order to protect her from his father.Bin Salman, who is widely seen as a reformer on Saudi Arabia’s ultra-repressive attitude towards women, is scheduled to arrive in the United States on Monday for high-level diplomatic talks as his power expands over the country.The loosening of restrictions forms part of the Crown Prince’s modernization movement known as the “Vision 2030” economic program, which was officially approved by Saudi leadership last April.As well as promoting economic growth, the program also intends to liberalize many of the country’s Islamic conditions. Last year, authorities legalized yoga, held the first-ever women’s basketball tournament, and made roles available for women to work in the Ministry of Justice.However, the country’s human rights record is still far worse than many of its allies, with citizens regularly arrested and detained for crimes such as religious blasphemy, criticising the government, or dressing inappropriately.Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Consulting revealed that American companies since 2007 have filed over 2,118 autonomous vehicle technology patents. Many filings are for Lidar laser sensors, vehicle-to-vehicle communication, image processing, computer vision, and advanced driver-assistance.With a similar bill unanimously passing the House of Representatives in September, the Senate version was introduced on September 28 and moved through the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on November 28.For her first 24 years in the U.S. Senate, Feinstein was viewed as a tireless advocate for Silicon Valley tech initiatives. But on November 1, Feinstein, threatened Silicon Valley executives that Congress would do something about foreign interference in elections through social media, if the tech industry failed to act.Feinstein told general counsels from Facebook, Google, and Twitter at a Senate Hearing: “I must say, I don’t think you get it.” She argued that tech company platforms were responsible for foreign powers being able to use cyber-warfare during the 2016 presidential election to sow conflict and discontent all over the country.Democrat Silicon Valley Congressman Ro Khanna told the San Jose Mercury News that the 85-year-old Feinstein, as the oldest member of the U.S. Senate, does not represent progressive values on key issues including privacy, encryption, “Medicare for All,” and the new innovation economy.Feinstein was also humiliated at the California Democrat Party Convention in late February, when she only received endorsement support for a fifth term from 37 percent of delegates; while California State Senate majority leader Kevin de León won 54 percent.It is unclear if Senator Feinstein deliberately retaliated against Silicon Valley and its social justice warrior fellow travelers for failing to support her re-election effort. But Feinstein did rally several senior Democratic Senators, who now claim self-driving car technology is too unproven for a national roll-out through a federal takeover.Feinstein’s opposition to allowing national driverless car tests carries extra Congressional weight, since the State of California has allowed testing on public roads since September 2014.What had seemed like at least an easy victory for Silicon Valley now is rated at just a 32 percent chance of enactment, according to Skopos Labs.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

In fact, Robinson claims that 60 percent of the Muslims in jail for terrorism, are ex-members of Choudary’s organization’. Choudary went on record praising the 9\11 attacks and is currently serving a 5-year sentence for encouraging British Muslims to join ISIS. Delingpole went on to ask, “How many people have you radicalized to the extent where they went and killed somebody?”, to which Tommy said “none”:But, it didn’t stop them from trying to drag me into the Darren Osborne case, with no evidence either.Darren Osborne, is the man responsible for the Finsbury Park attack, where he drove into a group of Muslims outside their Welfare House – resulting in 10 casualties and one death. Robinson said that he has taken legal action against Britain’s Crown Prosecution Service for claiming that he exchanged ‘private Twitter messages with Osborne’, which he described as ‘a complete, and utter lie’. He also shared that he was not informed about being dragged into the case, which ‘resulted in multiple death threats’.According to Robinson, Osborne decided to target the “Al Quds march, which was a terrorist march, but couldn’t get there.” So, “he ran over innocent Muslims”. In his suicide letter, he named “Sadiq Khan, Jeremy Corbyn” and “a series of Islamic, terrorist attacks” as the roots for his radicalization and the driving force behind his decision to take the lives of innocent victims. Robinson was in fact not mentioned once:I was banned for stating that 90% of grooming gang convictions are Muslim menTommy Robinson’s Twitter account was banned again for bringing up research done by Quilliam, a Muslim think-tank, and for speaking about the grooming gang case in Huddersfield, where “29 men are on trial, and out those 29, 27 are Muslim”. The persecution experienced by Robinson at the hands of the mainstream media and the political establishment does not end here. He predicts that within the next 12 months he will be ‘completely removed from online activity’ by ‘social media giants.’ He said that ‘any way we want to operate in’ they are going to ‘make it impossible’. But this, Robinson said, has only made him more determined to lead …the largest alternative media news network the world has seenTalking about his book, Mohammed’s Koran, Robinson reminisces about the historical attitude towards Islam in Britain saying that “our clergy, our politicians, our military have always been completely honest about Islam – calling it ‘the religion of war’.” He brings up the example of Sir William Gladstone, who famously held the Qu’ran above his head in Parliament and said, “We will never have peace on this earth, so long as we have this book” – today “he would be labelled an Islamophobic bigot and driven out of politics”.For the full interview visit here:MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

This is slightly less than double the 149 crimes recorded in 2013.Tagesspiegel reports that no analysis has been released with the figures to acurately explain the rise in anti-Semitic crime, but police and city officials have previously stated that they believe there is a correlation linking it to the increased number of migrants from the Middle East living in the city.As Breitbart Jerusalem has reported, attacks on Jews in Germany have been on the rise nationally and are not limited purely to Berlin, although schoolteachers and other school officials in the capital have noticed a rising trend of anti-Semitism among pupils and say the expression “You Jew!” has become a common insult.﻿Last October the German Interior Ministry announced that the number of anti-Semitic incidents in the country had risen by four per cent since 2016 as some accused the government of presenting the crimes as coming from right-wing sources rather than radical Islamists and newly-arrived immigrants from the Middle East.Such are the fears from Germany’s Jewish community that in January the German government appointed a special commissioner to address the problem. Although the commissioner’s powers are yet to be defined, the Central Council of Jews welcomed the move, calling it an important signal that their concerns were being addressed.Current German methodologies for classifying anti-Semitic crime has in the past been criticized for its accuracy in identifying motives.  A special commission into anti-Semitism, which published a report last year, said that “there is likely a distorted picture of anti-Semitic crime which exaggerates right-wing motives and perpetrators.”As for refugees from Muslim countries, they have been told to abandon their anti-Semitism and prepare to learn about the Holocaust, in twin warnings issued from the highest levels of government.German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in 2017 that inbound immigrants must reject any lingering notions of anti-Semitism on arrival, saying acceptance of followers of the Jewish faith remains a “non-negotiable” part of the social contract with their new home. MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2018/03/16/no-room-debate-egypts-sisi-poised-second-term/","CAIRO (AFP) – With Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on the cusp of winning a second term in this month’s election, what’s left of the opposition is reduced to praying he will step aside in four years.There is little else his critics can realistically hope for after Sisi eviscerated his opposition in his first term.In the run up to the March 26-28 election, a succession of would-be candidates were abruptly sidelined like doomed characters in an Agatha Christie novel.“Watch out. That stuff that happened seven or eight years ago (the 2011 democratic uprising) will not happen again in Egypt… it looks like you really don’t know me well. Ha ha,” Sisi said in a January speech after his latest rival, a reserve military general, was detained for announcing his candidacy.Such words play well with Sisi’s supporters, including many Egyptians who have had enough of the turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising that ousted president Hosni Mubarak.– The ‘higher interest’ –A former army chief, Sisi was first elected in 2014, a year after he ousted his bungling predecessor Mohamed Morsi.Morsi was the country’s first freely elected civilian president, but also a divisive Islamist whose policies sparked massive protests.Since then, the country has grappled with a persistent jihadist campaign that killed hundreds, along with long-deferred economic reforms that have resulted in sky-rocketing inflation.“The priority is to fix the situation, and not necessarily according to the traditional standards of a democracy,” said Mostafa El-Feki, a prominent government supporter and head of the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, a major library in Alexandria.“This is his priority, and this is the higher interest of the Egyptian people. I and most Egyptians believe he is on that course.”But it is difficult to ascertain what most Egyptians believe, given scant independent opinion polls and a domestic media that often touts Sisi’s achievements while underplaying criticism against him.His security services tolerate little outright dissent like that which foreshadowed the 2011 uprising.For now, the opposition — a collection of small parties and groups that hold little sway on the street — is merely trying to “exist,” said Khaled Dawoud, a prominent dissident.Mohamed Anwar Sadat, who withdrew his candidacy in January citing restrictions, said he hoped Sisi would begin democratic reforms in his second term — his last, unless the constitution is amended to allow him more time in power.“It would be a golden opportunity for the president to start dealing with the political file and reforms and look into building real institutions that can fulfil their role,” Sadat said.Sisi faced two heavyweight rivals in the election: former military chief of staff Sami Anan, who was detained, and former premier Ahmed Shafiq.The latter was deported from his exile in the United Arab Emirates after declaring his candidacy, and on his arrival was driven by government officials straight to a hotel where he stayed until he withdrew his candidacy.Another, a military colonel, was jailed for six years for announcing his candidacy while still an officer.The last remaining candidate, Moussa Mostafa Moussa, an ardent Sisi loyalist, entered the race just as it appeared Sisi would embarrassingly have to stand alone in a throwback to referendums held by autocrats.– ‘It’s existential’ –Sadat said Sisi would probably have won even with Shafiq and Anan in the race. But the authorities were not keen on debates.“Perhaps the concern was if there were real candidates there could have been debate on their priorities, there would have been a discussion, and I think they didn’t want one in the current period,” he said.Michael Wahid Hanna, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation think tank, said the government’s approach was “one of zero tolerance”.“The Sisi regime is not going to allow space that could allow political forces to grow and gain confidence,” he said.Sisi and his supporters often portray Egypt as a victim of a foreign plot. Its agents, according to this theory, could include anything from Islamic State jihadists to foreign-funded civil society groups or foreign media outlets.Following Morsi’s ouster and a bloody crackdown on his supporters that killed and jailed hundreds, wiping out the Muslim Brotherhood movement as a political force, Washington sanctioned Egypt by temporarily suspending military aid.Such international censure against crackdowns on dissidents or civil society groups have little effect on Sisi, a former Barack Obama administration official said.“They believe the state will collapse,” she said, on condition of anonymity.“It’s existential for them. Almost anything can be sacrificed (to prevent that outcome). In that situation it is very hard to imagine the external leverage that would be sufficient.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2018/03/16/un-gets-100m-new-funds-palestinian-aid-u-s-cuts/","ROME (AP) — The United Nations received pledges Thursday of nearly $100 million in new funding for the UN relief agency for Palestinians after the US slashed its aid, but it is still facing a nearly $350 million shortfall this year.UN officials said the countries providing the new financing included Qatar, Canada, Switzerland, Turkey, New Zealand, Norway, Korea, Mexico, Slovakia, India and France.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said “an important first step was reached” at an emergency donor conference in Rome with the new pledges. But he said “a long way is in front of us” to fully fund the agency, which went into the conference facing a $446 million gap in financing this year — the worst funding crisis in its 68-year history.“If UNRWA would not exist, if these services were not provided, the security of region would be severely undermined,” Guterres told reporters at the conference’s conclusion. “Now it is very clear, it is absolutely essential, that the extraordinary unanimity in political support to UNRWA and its activities translates itself into cash.”The agency, the oldest and largest UN relief program in the Middle East, provides health care, education and social services to an estimated 5 million Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. They are the refugees or descendants of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who either fled or were forced from their homes during the war that led to Israel’s establishment in 1948.Israel has long complained that UNRWA, unlike UNHCR, has no limits to its recognition of refugees, allowing unlimited generations of descendants, including those born in other countries or who are citizens of those countries, to continue to be classified as refugees in perpetuity.Guterres told the conference that cutting sanitation, health care and medical services in already poverty-wracked and conflict-ridden areas “would have severe impact — a cascade of problems that could push the suffering in disastrous and unpredictable directions.”The Trump administration announced in January it was slashing $65 million this year. But the agency said the actual cut was around $300 million because the US had led the agency to believe it would provide $365 million in 2018.The US had been UNWRA’s largest donor, supplying nearly 30 percent of its budget. In announcing the cuts in January, the US State Department said it wanted reforms at the agency, which Israel has strongly criticized.Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, who along with his counterparts from Jordan and Sweden co-hosted the meeting, said the agency had already undertaken reform measures to streamline and rationalize its activities. But he said “there is a limit to its ability to do so” given the enormous sustained needs faced by 5 million people.“It is vital and it is necessary to address these very basic services, but also to provide dignity for multitudes of Palestinians and to (protect) many of them from the potential threats of radicalization and terrorism,” he told reporters.The agency’s chief, Pierre Kraehenbuel, said expectations in the region were high that donors would step up.“The message to the Palestinian refugees has to be that they are not forgotten,” he said.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/16/blue-state-blues-solve-problem-like-pelosi/","Nancy Pelosi is a drag.That’s the lesson of Conor Lamb’s narrow victory in this week’s special congressional election in Pennsylvania’s eighteenth congressional district, where the Democrat ran explicitly against the House Minority Leader — even though he will end up voting with Pelosi almost 100% of the time.This was the first special election for a U.S. House seat that Democrats had won since President Donald Trump was elected in November 2016. They lost on five previous occasions — even though the mainstream media had expected them to win in several cases.Last year, in the special election in Georgia’s sixth congressional district, the media favorite was Democrat Jon Ossoff, who nearly won outright in the primary and ran a star-studded, energetic campaign in the general election.Republican Karen Handel seemed to have run a lackluster campaign that lacked Ossoff’s sparkle. Nothing she tried seemed to work — not even pointing out that Ossoff lived outside the district, which the media, bizarrely, considered a low blow.But then the GOP hit upon the winning strategy: tie Ossoff to Pelosi.Pelosi, who represents far-left San Francisco, is reviled by Republicans because of the memory of how she behaved as Speaker of the House from 2007 to 2011.She centralized power in the Speaker’s office to an unprecedented degree and excluded the opposition from much of the legislative process. She spent wildly, passing bloated earmarks and omnibus bills targeted at Democrats’ cronies and pet projects.Most infamously, Pelosi rammed Obamacare through the House in 2010, while declaring that Congress needed “to “pass the bill so that you can find out what’s in it.”She added a racial flourish to that effort, marching together with civil rights veteran Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) through a crowd of thousands of anti-Obamacare protesters on Capitol Hill while brandishing the Speaker’s gavel.She intended to portray “free” health care as a civil right, and protesters as the white racist mobs of the segregated South. The media followed her lead, repeating Lewis’s false claim that protesters shouted the “n-word” at him.Republicans took their revenge that November. Thanks to Pelosi’s arrogance, Democrats went down to historic defeat in the 2010 midterm elections.Pelosi lost the Speaker’s gavel — but, incredibly, she remained the leader of her party’s caucus. She turned aside a challenge by moderate Rep. Heath Shuler (D-NC) in 2011, just as she would later rebuff Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) in 2017. And as her caucus shrank, paradoxically, her iron grip on her party became even tighter.But after Ossoff lost in Georgia, the first voices of dissent began to emerge. Quietly, critics speculated about her age and her mental sharpness.Pelosi fought back, declaring herself a “master legislator” and a “politically astute leader.” Those claims were rather dubious, but one thing is certain: Pelosi is one of the Democrats’ most effective fundraisers. As CNN observed last August: “The simple fact is that without Pelosi, Democrats would be at a massive disadvantage financially.”She also attempted to deflate concerns about her age when she staged a faux “filibuster” on the floor of the House last month, delivering a record-breaking speech that lasted over eight hours, with no bathroom breaks.Gender is also a factor in Pelosi’s favor. In the year of “#metoo” and “Time’s Up,” when Democrats are hoping to turn feminine outrage against abusive (and mostly liberal) men into votes, the party is afraid to dump the first female Speaker of the House.But the results in Georgia and Pennsylvania don’t lie. And aspiring Democratic Party candidates are worried about their own prospects first. They will make their peace with Pelosi, eventually — once they are safely in office.That is why, for example, not one of the five Democrats running to replace retiring Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA) in Southern California would commit to supporting Pelosi when asked to do so in a recent Democratic debate.So the Democrats have a dilemma. They cannot win with Pelosi, and they cannot win without her.In Pennsylvania, they reached a kind of accommodation. The party allowed Lamb to trash Pelosi because he is, after all, only one vote.But that will not work in November, when all 435 seats are up for grabs. Unless Democrats can replace her before then, Pelosi is going to be the target for Republicans, who are desperate to maintain control of the House.Democrats have a problem in Pelosi. And that means Republicans still have a chance to turn 2018 around.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News. He was named to Forward’s 50 “most influential” Jews in 2017.

A local Native American tribe, the Winnemem Wintu, also opposes raising the dam.The dam was first built during the latter years of the Great Depression, and was completed in 1945.The state’s farming interests are intensely interested in the project. The Westlands Water District, which represents farmers in the relatively dry western portion of the agricultural Central Valley, is hoping that new water from the Shasta Dam will replace water that has been lost to state restrictions and to a federal judicial mandate that flushes water out to sea to protect the endangered San Joaquin Delta smelt.As the Times notes, a former lobbyist for Westlands, David Bernhardt, is now Deputy Secretary of the Interior. And Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), who represents part of the southern Central Valley, is in a position to bring farmers’ concerns to the fore.Breitbart News reported several years ago that California Republicans were pushing for the Shasta Dam to be raised even under the Obama administration.In an interview in 2014, Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA) complained to Breitbart News that the federal and state governments were both opposed to increasing water storage in California. “We are being governed by people who are out of their minds,” he said.As Breitbart News noted, “McClintock suggested raising the height of the Shasta Dam from the current 600 feet to 800 feet, as originally designed. That, he said, would add nine million acre-feet to its existing storage capacity–double its present volume.”The dam is located on federal land. But state law prohibits raising it. The federal government is pushing ahead with the project, regardless.That means the clash will ultimately come down to the Constitution — and the courts.Joel B.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2018/03/15/caroline-glick-firing-rex-tillerson-removed-obstacle-middle-east-peace/","As Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was being fired on Tuesday, his central assumptions about the Palestinian conflict with Israel, which are shared by the entire Washington foreign policy establishment, literally blew up in Gaza.On Tuesday morning, Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah’s convoy was attacked by a roadside bomb during an official visit in Hamas-controlled Gaza.Hamdallah was in Gaza to inaugurate a wastewater treatment facility sponsored by the World Bank. The facility was approved 14 years ago, but infighting between Hamas, which runs Gaza, and Fatah, the PLO ruling faction which controls the Palestinian Authority (PA), blocked its operation time after time.The shuttered water treatment facility in northern Gaza has long been a monument to the Palestinian leadership’s incompetence and indifference to the plight of the people it is supposed to be serving. As the plant gathered dust, Gaza plunged deeper and deeper into a water crisis.As the Times of Israel reported, Gaza has two water problems: insufficient ground water, and massive pollution of the existing supply due to the absence of sufficient sewage treatment facilities.Untreated sewage is dumped directly into the Mediterranean Sea, and then seeps back into Gaza’s groundwater.Gaza’s polluted acquifiers only produce a quarter of its water needs, and due to insufficient water treatment facilities, 97 percent of Gaza’s natural water sources are unsafe for human consumption.Hamdallah’s visit to Hamas-controlled Gaza was supposed to show that the Fatah-Hamas unity deal Egypt brokered between the two terror groups last year was finally enabling them to solve Gaza’s humanitarian needs.And then Hamdallah’s convoy was bombed, and the whole charade of Palestinian governing competence and responsibility was put to rest.Later in the day, the White House held a Middle East summit that demonstrated Tillerson’s basic assumptions have the problems of the Middle East precisely backwards.Under the leadership of Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, along with Jason Greenblatt, Trump’s senior negotiator, Israeli officials sat in the White House for the first time with Arab officials from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Oman, and Qatar. Representatives from Egypt and Jordan, with which Israel enjoys open diplomatic relations, were also in attendance. Canadian and European officials participated as well.Although they were invited, the Palestinians chose to boycott the conference. Their boycott was telling. The PA claimed it was boycotting the conference in retaliation for America’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and President Trump’s plan to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem on Israel’s 70th Independence Day in May.But anger over Jerusalem doesn’t justify the snub. The purpose of the summit wasn’t to reach “the ultimate deal.” The summit was called to to formulate the means to contend with the humanitarian crises emanating from Hamas-controlled Gaza. The Palestinians boycotted a summit whose sole purpose was to help them.As Palestinian commentator Bassam Tawil noted, the PA’s boycott while appalling, was unsurprising.The White House summit was a threat to both rival Palestinian factions. It showed that the Trump administration, which both Fatah and Hamas hate passionately, cares more about the Palestinians than they do.The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is entirely the product of Hamas and Fatah actions. In an op-ed in the Washington Post last week, Greenblatt laid the blame on Hamas. “Hamas’s utter failure to fulfill any of the most basic functions of governance has brought Gaza to the brink of collapse, which has necessitated the response of the international community.”Fatah, Tawil noted, is just as responsible. The Fatah-controlled PA has used the Palestinians of Gaza as a pawn in its power struggle against Hamas. Rather than work to decontaminate Gaza’s water supply and provide for the basic needs of the population, for the past year the PA has imposed economic sanctions on the Gaza Strip.Ostensibly imposed to induce the population of Gaza to rise up against Hamas, they have simply served to increase the misery of the residents of Gaza. Hamas’s power remains unchallenged as Qatar, Turkey, and Iran shower the terror group with cash and arms.As Tawil noted, Hamas and Fatah are willing to fight one another until the last Palestinian in Gaza.The conference showed that the attack on Hamdallah’s convoy was not a freak episode. The bombing was emblematic of the Fatah-Hamas leadership’s obsession with their own power, to the detriment of the people they claim to represent.The events in Gaza and the White House on Tuesday tell us two important things.First, they reveal that the primary obstacle to both peace and regional stability in the Middle East is the Palestinian leadership – both from Fatah and Hamas.Not only did the PA refuse to participate in a summit dedicated solely to helping the Palestinians, but also the very day the summit took place, PA-controlled Voice of Palestine Radio reported that the PA intends to file a complaint against President Trump at the International Criminal Court. Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem, the PA insists, “violated all international laws and resolutions.”The report also said the PA intends to sue Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman for “crimes against the Palestinian people.”Tuesday’s second lesson is that while the PA is the primary obstacle to peace and regional stability, it is easily surmountable.Tuesday’s conference was a diplomatic triumph for the Trump administration. For the first time, official representatives of five Arab states that have no diplomatic relations with Israel sat publically in the White House with Israeli officials. They were brought together due to their common concern for the Palestinians in Gaza, and for the instability that the plight of the Palestinians in Hamas-controlled Gaza might encourage.Although it is still unknown whether anything discussed at the conference will turn into concrete improvements on the ground, the summit itself was a concrete achievement. It showed that the Arabs are willing publicly to bypass the Palestinians to work with Israel. The fact that the conference was devoted to helping the Palestinians served to transform the PA from the critical partner in any peace deal to an irritating irrelevance.And that brings us to Tillerson, and the foreign policy establishment whose positions he channeled.During his 14 months in office, Tillerson insisted on maintaining the establishment’s view that the Fatah-controlled PA is the be-all-and-end-all of Middle East peace efforts. The view that there can be no Arab-Israeli peace without the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLOP compelled successive U.S. administrations to continue to embrace it despite its support for terrorism, and despite its refusal to accept or even respond to any offer of peace by either Israel or the U.S.The belief that there can be no peace without Fatah convinced successive American administrations to pour billions of dollars in aid money down the black hole of PA treasury accounts. Since the Israeli-PLO peace process began in 1993, the Palestinians have received more international aid per capita than any nation on earth has received in world history. And all they produced are an impoverished, sewage-filled terror state in Gaza, and a jihadist hub in Judea and Samaria that would explode in violence if Israel did not control security.The view that the U.S. needs the PLO and its PA to achieve peace gave the Palestinian leadership an effective veto over every U.S. policy towards Israel and towards the peace process.Trump’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move the embassy to Jerusalem was the first time any American leader since Bill Clinton had dared to reject the Palestinian veto on US Middle East policy.Tillerson supported maintaining the PA’s veto. As a result, he all but openly opposed Trump’s decision.So too, last June, in a bid to protect U.S. funding to the PA — despite the fact that fully 7 percent of its donor-funded budget is used to pay salaries to terrorists in Israeli prisons and their families — Tillerson falsely told the Senate Foreign Relations committee that the PA had agreed to end the payments. After the Palestinians themselves denied his statement, he only partially walked it back. The next day, he told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the U.S. was in “active discussions” with the Palestinians regarding halting the payments.In the event, the PA raised its payments to terrorists in 2017 to $403 million. In 2016, the PA spent $347 million to pay salaries to terrorist murderers and their families.In other words, Tillerson is so committed to the view that there can be no peace without the PA, that he willingly misled U.S. lawmakers.Trump administration officials keep insisting that they are almost ready to present their peace plan for the Palestinians and Israel. But whatever the plan may entail, the steps the White House has already taken – Tuesday’s summit, Trump’s move on Jerusalem, and his determination to sign the Taylor Force Act to end U.S. support for the PA if it maintains its payments to terrorists – have already advanced the cause of peace more than any American peace proposal ever has and likely ever will.Those moves removed the principle blockage to all peace deals – namely, the Palestinian leadership from Fatah and Hamas alike. By bypassing the PA, the White House has focused its efforts on expanding the already burgeoning bilateral ties between Israel and the Arab states. It has encouraged the expansion of cooperation between these regional actors. That cooperation is the key to diminishing Iranian power in the region; defeating Sunni jihadists from the Muslim Brotherhood and its spinoffs; and to improving the lives and prospects for peace of Palestinians, Israelis and all the nations of the region.Tillerson opposed all of these actions. Like the foreign policy establishment he represented, Tillerson refused to abandon the false belief that nothing can be done without PLO approval. By removing him from office, President Trump took yet another step towards advancing prospects for peace in the Middle East.Caroline Glick is a world-renowned journalist and commentator on the Middle East and U.S. foreign policy, and the author of The Israeli Solution: A One-State Plan for Peace in the Middle East. Read more at www.CarolineGlick.com.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Thanks in part to the attention they generated, and the pressure their supporters put on the Obama administration, immigration officials let them return to the country.Mateo and the others applied for asylum, claiming “credible fear of persecution or torture in their birth country,” the Los Angeles Times reported — though, as ABC News reported, Mateo had returned to her home town in Oaxaca and posed with relatives for photographs.“Just being here for a week with my family and seeing how happy they are and how excited they are, I think it’s worth it,” the supposed asylum-seeker told ABC.So Mateo, who calls herself a “Dreamer” — one of those brought to the U.S. illegally “through no fault of their own,” as President Barack Obama said — chose to repeat her parents’ illegal crossing.Instead of being punished and deported, she has been rewarded with a legal education, membership in the California State Bar, a career as an attorney, and elevation to state office.Mateo is the first illegal alien appointed to statewide office in California.Joel B.

John Cornyn (R-TX), and Tom Tillis (R-NC) sent a letter Thursday to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein calling for the appointment of a special counsel.Last week, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-SC) wrote Sessions and Rosenstein, calling for the same.Both letters came after Sessions told Fox News that the Justice Department Inspector General — not his prosecutors — would look into any potential DOJ and FBI abuse of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act uncovered by the House Intelligence Committee.Grassley and Graham also released a less-redacted version of their criminal referral earlier this year for Christopher Steele, the author of the Trump dossier, which revealed the basis for the referral for the first time.They said Steele “materially misled the FBI” by saying he only shared the information in the dossier with Fusion GPS and the FBI, when he was actually providing that information to media outlets.They wrote in the referral that since the basis for the warrant authorizing surveillance on former Trump campaign aide Carter Page rests “largely on Mr. Steele’s credibility,” the DOJ “has a responsibility to determine whether Mr. Steele provided false information to the FBI and whether the FBI’s representations to the court were in error.”Grassley and Graham also released a letter they wrote February 28 to DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz, which included questions they asked him to look into surrounding the application and renewals of the surveillance warrant.They also asked him to review potential “improprieties” in the FBI’s relationship with Steele, and the potential conflicts of interest posed by the involvement of senior DOJ official Bruce Ohr “serving as the cut-out” between the FBI and Steele after the FBI terminated its formal relationship with Steele.Graham and Grassley asked the inspector general to look into apparent unauthorized disclosures of classified information to the press, the FBI and DOJ’s handling of the investigation of former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and other matters.The four senators wrote that having an inspector general looking into these matters was not enough. They wrote:We have the utmost confidence in the Inspector General’s integrity, fairness, and impartiality, and trust that he will complete these reviews in a thorough, unbiased, and timely fashion. However, by statute, the Inspector General does not have the tools that a prosecutor would to gather all the facts, such as the ability to obtain testimony from essential witnesses who are not current DOJ employees.“Thus, we believe that a special counsel is needed to work with the Inspector General to independently gather the facts and make prosecutorial decisions, if any are merited,” they wrote.“The Justice Department cannot credibly investigate itself without these enhanced measures of independence to ensure that the public can have confidence in the outcome.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Bruce Rauner, just days before the Republican primary on Tuesday.An internal poll conducted by the Ives campaign shows her within just seven points of Rauner, trailing 42% to 35%. The poll has a 3.5% margin of error, according to the campaign.If accurate, those numbers mean that Ives has a chance of mounting a dramatic come-from-behind victory in the closing days of the campaign.In January, Ives trailed Rauner by more than 40 points. Now, she has momentum on her side — and she is attracting the attention of the Democratic opposition.The Democratic Governors Association released an ad on Thursday attacking Ives as “too conservative for Illinois.” It warns viewers: “Ives wants to ban abortions, she has an ‘A’ rating from the NRA, pushing to arm teachers and stop new gun laws. And on immigration, Ives marches in lockstep with President Trump, trying to eliminate protections for undocumented immigrants.”As the Chicago Sun-Times notes, the Democratic ad attacking Ives actually “helps her get her message out.”As Ives has surged, Rauner has shifted to the right. On Tuesday, for example, he vetoed a bill that would have regulated gun shops in the state, drawing criticism from Democrats and gun control activists.Rauner has refused to debate Ives, aside from a joint appearance at the Chicago Tribune editorial board endorsement meeting. On Tuesday evening, Ives appeared alone at a “debate” hosted by local public television station WTTW.The risk: by leaving Ives alone on the stage, Rauner might have created an opportunity for her to show her credentials as a credible alternative to the incumbent governor, who has disappointed conservatives by funding abortions, failing to stop tax hikes, and making Illinois a “sanctuary state.”Joel B.

Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) took to Twitter last week to claim that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had refused to provide Department of Justice documents about Operation Fast & Furious to congressional investigators.I met with AG Sessions to get the Fast & Furious documents. He said NO and decided to let it continue to play out in court. Frustrating and disappointing to say the least. @realDonaldTrump #FastAndFurious https://t.co/0rRaSAskC8— Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) March 3, 2018But a Department of Justice (DOJ) source present at a meeting between Chaffetz and Sessions told Breitbart News that Sessions did not refuse to provide documents relating to Fast & Furious. On the contrary, the source said, the attorney general indicated that he would talk to Department of Justice attorneys about doing so.Last Wednesday, nearly a year after the meeting, the Department of Justice and the House Oversight Committee reached an agreement for documents on Fast and Furious to be provided to congressional investigators.Yet the dispute continues.Breitbart News was provided with notes from a DOJ staffer documenting a conversation between Sessions and Chaffetz, who was then the chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The meeting took place on April 6, 2017, and apparently covered a variety of topics under House investigation, such as scandals within the Secret Service.Under “Fast & Furious,” the handwritten notes indicate: “trying to extract docs.; we will talk to attys invol. in litig.”But Chaffetz disagrees. “The best evidence I have is what happened,” he told Breitbart News on Thursday.“More than a year later, they hadn’t released anything. The proof is in the pudding. They told me they’re gonna let it go through the courts.”Chaffetz, who left office midway through last year, had expressed his frustration with Sessions before.In June 2017, he said the Trump administration was “almost worse” than the Obama administration when it came to releasing documents relating to Department of Justice investigations on Fast & Furious and other matters.The Fast & Furious scandal involved a gun-running operation organized by the Arizona field office of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), within the Department of Justice, ostensibly to trace the movement of weapons to Mexican drug cartels.Critics later charged that the real purpose of the operation was to generate alarm about the flow of weapons in order to push for new restrictions of firearms within the U.S.The guns that were smuggled were used in the murder of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, as well as the murders of hundreds of people in Mexico. Some of the weapons were thought to have reached distant countries in South America.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder refused to provide DOJ documents related to Fast & Furious to Congress, leading to him being found in contempt of Congress in 2012 — the first Attorney General to be found in such contempt in U.S. history.President Barack Obama used executive privilege to protect some Fast and Furious-related documents, only to have a court reject that claim, whereupon those documents were provided to Congress.Chaffetz said that he had expected Sessions to be more aggressive about uncovering the truth about Fast and Furious.“I had greatest hope that a Trump administration, with a Republican attorney general would pry open the vault and expose the truth, and generally that’s not what’s happened,” he told Breitbart News.“I mean, I’m glad they’ve come to this settlement agreement, but there are still things that won’t be released, and that’s a crying shame,” he said.Joel B.

McMaster had harsh words for Russia and Iran on Thursday at a discussion at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum on the ongoing civil war in Syria, saying it is time for “consequences” for the two supporters of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime.His remarks were made on the same day The Washington Post reported that Trump has decided to dismiss McMaster from his advisory post. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted that there are currently no changes at the National Security Council (NSC).At the museum event, McMaster said Assad is responsible for some of the “worst atrocities known to man,” including the rape, torture, and murder of innocent Syrians since the war began seven years ago.“If Iran and Russia do not stop enabling the regime’s atrocities and adhere to UN Security Council resolutions, all nations must respond more forcibly than simply issuing strong statements,” McMaster said, noting that an estimated 500,000 people have died in the war including from chemical weapons attacks.“It is time to impose serious political and economic consequences on Moscow and Tehran,” McMaster said. “Assad should not have immunity for his crimes and neither should his sponsors.”“All civilized nations must hold Iran and Russia accountable for their role in enabling atrocities and perpetuating human suffering in Syria,” McMaster said.In his remarks, McMaster said that the United States’ efforts to help civilians in Syria and defeat terrorist groups like the Islamic State were being “impeded” by both Russia and Iraq, although he did not mention Iran’s Supreme Leader Sayyid Ali Hosseini Khamenei or Russian President Vladimir Putin by name.McMaster said Iran has been funding the Assad regime to the tune of $16 billion since 2012 and is also responsible for arming terrorists in Syria, Iran, and Yemen.“Iran’s goal is to secure a permanent military foothold in Syria,” McMaster said. “Which would threaten Israel, undermine U.S. interests and strengthen the terrorist and proxy forces that Iran uses to weaken Arab states and foment violence.”McMaster listed some of Assad’s atrocities, including imprisoning and torturing his countryman, which is detailed in a new exhibit at the museum featuring lists of prisoners written in blood and rust on scraps of clothing that could be smuggled out to let families know of their loved one’s fate.A new exhibit at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum focuses on the atrocities perpetrated by the Assad regime in Syria, including names of prisoners written on scraps of clothing in blood and rust to document who was imprisoned by the regime.

These targeted sanctions are a part of a broader effort to address the ongoing nefarious attacks emanating from Russia.And in what turned out to be a hat trick day for U.S. strikes on Putin’s regime, on Thursday the Pentagon accused Russia of “double-dealing” in Syria, agreeing to a ceasefire but then supporting Syrian forces bombing civilians in East Ghouta.“Russia agrees to a cease-fire, but supports a regime that continues bombing innocent civilians,” Pentagon Chief Spokesperson Dana White said.“Russia could stop the civilian casualties in Syria. Instead, their double-dealing is exacerbating the loss of innocent lives. The Russians made a deliberate choice not to restrain the Assad regime. Thus, the carnage in East Ghouta continues.

With the wealthy, only 52 percent said keeping U.S. manufacturing jobs was more important than low product prices, while 30 percent said cheap products were more important.The poll shows widespread support for President Trump’s economic nationalist agenda — specifically among his base of working and middle-class Americans.Most recently, against the wishes of the globalist, free-trade-wing of his White House and the Republican Party, Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on imported aluminum, both designed to increase manufacturing of steel and aluminum in the U.S.American workers who suffered from decades of endless multinational free trade agreements thanked Trump in video messages, noting how unfair free trade had “left our factories to rot,” as Breitbart News reported.""We thought we were running fine and it just came and they said, you know we just can’t sustain anymore, we’re going to be shutting the doors.

In total, about 700,000 U.S. have been displaced, including:Meanwhile, since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect in the 1990s, at least one million net U.S. jobs have been lost because of the free trade deal. Between 2000 and 2014, there have been about five million manufacturing jobs lost across the country as trade deficits continue soaring.One former steel town in West Virginia lost 94 percent of its steel jobs because of NAFTA, with nearly 10,000 workers in the town being displaced from the steel industry.

Subsequently, Schaaf helped many criminal illegal aliens with sex crime convictions, drunk driving convictions, and armed robbery convictions escape arrest and deportation.Before making her public warning to illegal aliens in Oakland, though, emails obtained by CBS San Francisco reveal that Schaaf warned businesses with illegal alien employees with an alert message to help the employees avoid being arrested and deported by ICE.“Important Alert! Credible information ICE Raids in Oakland Sunday 2/25 and Monday 2/26,” the message from the mayor’s office to a local business group, the Oakland Indie Alliance, reads. “This information comes directly from the Mayor.”Those businesses who got the warning from Schaaf in order to protect their illegal alien employees include:The emails also reveal that Schaaf was in contact with a local open borders group, Centro Legal de la Raza, which helps illegal aliens get attorneys to avoid deportations. The emails between the group and Schaaf show that they were in touch before her announcement, speaking specifically about what employers can do during a raid by ICE.Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s Department of Justice (DOJ) told Breitbart News exclusively that he is working with ICE officials and attorneys to consider prosecuting Schaaf for obstruction of justice.Sessions said:I believe that the mayor made a colossal error in her statement that placed the safety of our federal law officers at risk, and that increased the likelihood that hundreds of serious criminals would avoid arrest and continue to remain on our streets, posing a risk to the people of the Bay Area. And we are in communication with [Acting ICE] Director [Thomas] Homan, and we look forward to reviewing the facts as they present them to our attorneys. But I couldn’t comment beyond that. [Emphasis added]As Breitbart News reported, a plurality of Americans — nearly half — say Sessions should prosecute the Oakland mayor for obstruction of justice by aiding criminal illegal aliens in escaping deportation.About 47 percent of likely voters say the DOJ should prosecute Schaaf for obstruction of justice, while only 36 percent of likely voters say the DOJ should not prosecute the mayor.A plurality of swing-voters, about 40 percent, agreed that Schaaf should be prosecuted for warning criminal illegal aliens ahead of an ICE raid.Working and middle-class Americans are the most supportive of Schaaf being prosecuted by the DOJ, with 52 percent of likely voters earning $30,000 to $50,000 a year saying the mayor should be hit with charges.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has  demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”Reading Voters’ MindsThe Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.Then a chance meeting bought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and Mr. Mercer declined to comment.Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”An International EffortJust as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.After the LeakBy early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/trump-tariffs-lobbying.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum has prompted a stampede by foreign countries and companies and their American partners pressing for exemptions and exclusions that could be worth billions of dollars in trade.Corporations and foreign leaders are leaning on personal relationships in vying for meetings with White House officials, hiring lawyers and lobbyists to defend them, and drafting messages to persuade the public of the importance of free trade.On Thursday afternoon, top oil and gas executives left an American Petroleum Institute board meeting at the Trump International Hotel in Washington and headed to the White House to personally lobby Mr. Trump, telling him that his pending steel tariffs could raise the cost of pipelines and extraction projects across the country, and discussing possible exemptions.Three days earlier, the American Soybean Association, whose members are among the biggest United States exporters, requested a meeting with Mr. Trump. After hearing nothing, they sent 120 farmers and association employees to meet with lawmakers from farming states, arguing that the tariffs could set off retaliation and hurt American agriculture.The rush started when Mr. Trump floated the potential for exclusions, saying that Canada and Mexico would be exempted from the 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum as the countries renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. He also spoke warmly of Australia as an ally and trading partner, and said that other nations with close relationships to the United States might be exempted, too.“The dinner bell is ringing for the trade bar and associated lobbyists and consultants,” said Chip Roh, a former partner at Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Lawyers and lobbyists are employed on both sides, arguing for and against exemptions, he said, adding, “It creates a fertile field.”But the Trump administration has yet to clarify what precisely will qualify trading partners for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting America’s national security and reducing its trade deficit. That has led to a chaotic and anxious period as companies and countries try their best to meet unclear specifications, and the clock continues to tick toward tariffs that are expected to go into effect next Friday, wiping out valuable contracts and putting global supply chains at risk.Robert Lighthizer, the government’s top trade negotiator, has been charged with helping decide which countries will be excluded, while Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, has been tasked with a parallel process for exempting imports of certain products that are not widely available in the United States. The Commerce Department has developed its procedures for such exclusions, but it has not yet released them publicly. Those will be issued by Sunday, a spokesman said.The European Union commissioner for trade, Cecilia Malmstrom, speaking on Wednesday to the European Parliament, said she left a meeting with Mr. Lighthizer over the weekend in Brussels without “sufficient clarity” about how countries would secure exclusions.In the interim, trade lawyers and lobbyists in Washington have begun offering assistance in securing exemptions and exclusions for foreign countries, companies and their United States partners. Lobbyists said they intended to seek support from elected officials in pushing for exemptions, and some lawmakers have already weighed in.Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, has already helped make the case for an exemption for a major pipeline project in her state, predicting that the tariffs could add $500 million to the cost of a $43 billion natural gas export terminal that her state is building with China.The American Petroleum Institute sent 12 top executives from energy companies including BP America, Exxon Mobil, Phillips 66 and Shell to lobby Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. The assembled group explained that free trade has been a boon to the industry and stressed the importance of steel to its operations, according to a person briefed on the meeting.Mr. Trump in turn told the executives that his administration wanted to make sure that the tariffs did not hurt the industry, the person briefed on the meeting said.The trade group issued a statement on Thursday saying that its executives “highlighted a host of the industry’s priority issues, including the importance of trade policies that recognize the integrated nature of North American and global markets.”In recent days, Hogan Lovells and Covington & Burling — firms that specialize in international trade law and lobbying — published memos heralding their ability to help clients obtain exemptions, and dropping hints as to how they might go about doing so.Hogan Lovells noted that existing contracts for steel or aluminum imports could potentially receive “grandfather” exemptions. One company whose costs could rise because of the tariffs, Kinder Morgan, a pipeline maker based in Houston, recently signed Hogan Lovells to lobby on the impact of the “imposition of steel tariffs on pipeline construction,” according to a congressional filing posted last week.CGCN Group, a lobbying firm, recommends that companies highlight the advantages of global trade to a public that has grown skeptical, according to polls.“Proponents of free trade need to tailor their arguments to those Americans who have watched factories close and wages stagnate,” according to a memo that CGCN sent last week to clients and prospective clients. It suggested that companies seeking exemptions refrain from warning of tumbling stock prices or potential layoffs, and instead argue that “the more money companies spend on steel and aluminum, the less they have to hire workers or give them a raise.”Daniel Porter, chief trade lawyer for the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, said he was counseling his clients that the exemption process could look similar to previous tariff processes, which allowed companies to file for exemptions and then gave their American competitors a chance to object to any of those requests.With the current steel and aluminum tariffs, however, there is likely to be one notable change: Only companies based in the United States will be allowed to file for exclusions. That means steel makers in Japan and Europe will need to get their American customers to come forward and file the request on their behalf.Companies like California Steel Industries, which makes flat rolled steel, and the Union Pacific railroad said they depended on foreign steel and were bracing for higher prices if they could not secure exemptions.Lance M. Fritz, the chief executive of Union Pacific, said the railroad’s most heavily trafficked routes were made with steel from Nippon Steel of Japan, which is harder and more durable than products available in the United States. If Japan does not secure an exemption, Mr. Fritz said, Union Pacific planned to apply for a product exclusion.Foreign metal makers are also worried that American mills will push aggressively against these exclusions, cutting off products that American companies buy.“There is that classic gray middle, where the customers say the U.S. mill can’t do an adequate job, and the U.S. mill says, ‘No, you’re being too finicky,’” Mr. Porter said. “Even with the back door, some very real American manufacturing entities are going to be hurt by this.”That fight is already on display, as American metal producers press the administration to avoid giving in to metal users, like food packagers and beer companies, who are agitating for exemptions.On Tuesday, the presidents of four trade associations — the American Beverage Association, the Beer Institute, the Brewers Association and the Can Manufacturers Institute — sent a letter to Mr. Ross asking for more clarification on the timing and process for exemptions. They argued that a delay would undoubtedly increase costs for manufacturers and could lead to unintended consequences.A separate letter on Thursday from the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which supported the tariffs, urged Mr. Ross and Mr. Lighthizer not to undermine them by issuing country exemptions and product exclusions that were too broad. The group said that new steel jobs in Granite City, Ill., and Lorain, Ohio, had already been announced in response to the tariffs and that overly broad exemptions could undermine that progress.Foreign governments are also looking for ways to avoid being hit by the tariffs, including having top officials speak personally to Mr. Trump.“Everybody is going to be calling in their chits and trying to make their points about why their exemptions make sense, but not everyone will be successful,” said Danny E. Sebright, the president of the U.S.-U.A.E. Business Council, a nonprofit group that seeks to bolster trade between the United States and the United Arab Emirates.The United Arab Emirates is a top exporter of aluminum to the United States. Mr. Sebright said that he expected Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, the effective ruler of the Emirates, to visit the United States in the coming weeks, and that aluminum would be a topic of conversation.“They’re going to work with the Trump administration on this, there is not going to be retaliation,” Mr. Sebright said.Australia has trumpeted an apparent exemption from Mr. Trump’s tariffs, which an Australian government official said on Monday was achieved as a result of “high level and sustained advocacy” by some of its highest-ranking officials. The country’s interlocutors included Greg Norman, a pro golfer and friend of the president who signed a letter telling him that the tariffs could have a negative effect on the relationship between the United States and Australia.Other governments plan to do less lobbying and more threatening.David O’Sullivan, the European Union ambassador to the United States, said that the bloc was “happy to explain why European exports are not the problem.” He added, “But we are not open to or willing to entertain links to unrelated issues.”On Friday, the European Union published a 10-page list of American products that would be targets for retaliation if the steel and aluminum tariffs go through, including peanut butter, grains, motorcycles and steel.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/andrew-mccabe-fbi-fired.html","WASHINGTON — Andrew G. McCabe, the former F.B.I. deputy director and a frequent target of President Trump’s scorn, was fired Friday after Attorney General Jeff Sessions rejected an appeal that would have let him retire this weekend.Mr. McCabe promptly declared that his firing, and Mr. Trump’s persistent needling, were intended to undermine the special counsel’s investigation in which he is a potential witness.Mr. McCabe is accused in a yet-to-be-released internal report of failing to be forthcoming about a conversation he authorized between F.B.I. officials and a journalist.In a statement released late Friday, Mr. Sessions said that Mr. McCabe had shown a lack of candor under oath on multiple occasions.“The F.B.I. expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity and accountability,” he said. “I have terminated the employment of Andrew McCabe effective immediately.”Early Saturday morning, the president weighed in with another shot at Mr. McCabe, posting on Twitter that it was “a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI.”In an interview, Mr. McCabe was blunt. “The idea that I was dishonest is just wrong,” he said, adding, “This is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness.”F.B.I. disciplinary officials recommended his dismissal. Mr. McCabe, who stepped down in January and took a leave of absence, denied the accusation and appealed this week to senior career officials in the Justice Department.Lack of candor is a fireable offense at the F.B.I., but Mr. McCabe’s last-minute dismissal was carried out against a highly politicized backdrop.Mr. McCabe was among the first at the F.B.I. to scrutinize possible Trump campaign ties to Russia. And he is a potential witness to the question of whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice. Mr. Trump has taunted Mr. McCabe both publicly and privately, and Republican allies have cast him as the center of a “deep state” effort to undermine the Trump presidency.As a witness, Mr. McCabe would be in a position to corroborate the testimony of the former F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who kept contemporaneous notes on his conversations with Mr. Trump. Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump prodded him to publicly exonerate the president on the question of Russian collusion and encouraged him to shut down an investigation into his national security adviser.In a statement released by his lawyers, Mr. McCabe said his firing was part of Mr. Trump’s “ongoing war on the F.B.I.” and Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. He said he answered questions truthfully in the internal investigation and contacted investigators to correct the record when he believed they misunderstood him.“I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,” he said.Mr. McCabe, a 21-year F.B.I. veteran, was eligible for a government pension if he retired on Sunday. The firing jeopardizes that benefit, though it was not immediately clear how much he might lose.“It’s incredibly unfair to my reputation after a 21-year career,” Mr. McCabe said. He said the president’s public attacks were aimed at several targets. “The real damage is being done to the F.B.I., law enforcement and the special counsel,” he said.Mr. McCabe was the F.B.I.’s second in command during one of the most tumultuous periods in the bureau’s history. He oversaw investigations into both the Trump campaign and Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server — and he dealt with the fallout from both. He became the acting F.B.I. director after the sudden firing of his boss, Mr. Comey, and he publicly contradicted the White House on national television over whether Mr. Comey had lost the support of rank-and-file F.B.I. agents.Since then, Mr. Trump has repeatedly singled him out for public attack, suggesting that he helped protect Mrs. Clinton from prosecution during the 2016 presidential campaign. As evidence, he pointed to the fact that Mr. McCabe’s wife, Jill, ran as a Democrat for a State Senate seat in Virginia and received hundreds of thousands of dollars from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, a longtime ally of the Clintons.As recently as Thursday, even as the White House said it left Mr. McCabe’s fate in Mr. Sessions’s hands, officials there left little doubt where the president stood. “It is well documented that he has had some very troubling behavior and by most accounts a bad actor,” said the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Mr. McCabe’s lawyer called those comments “vile and defamatory” and said they were intended to put pressure on the Justice Department. “This intervention by the White House in the D.O.J. disciplinary process is unprecedented, deeply unfair and dangerous,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich.Mrs. McCabe lost her race and Mr. McCabe was later promoted to deputy director, where he oversaw the investigation into Mrs. Clinton. No charges were filed in that case, and Mr. Trump has pointed to the donations to Mrs. McCabe’s campaign as evidence of F.B.I. bias.The president is not involved in the firing decisions of career employees like Mr. McCabe. His firing had been recommended by veteran disciplinary officials. But Mr. Trump’s statements loom large over the decision, which is why previous presidents have typically refrained from wading into law enforcement and personnel matters.The inspector general’s report faults Mr. McCabe for his lack of candor in interviews with internal investigators. The report has not been released, but people briefed on it say the allegations revolve around disclosures to The Wall Street Journal, which reported in October 2016 a dispute between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department over how to proceed in an investigation into the Clinton family’s foundation.Mr. McCabe, working through the F.B.I. press office, authorized a spokesman and a bureau lawyer to speak with The Journal in order to rebut allegations that Mr. McCabe had slowed down the Clinton Foundation investigation. To the contrary, the article ultimately noted, Mr. McCabe had insisted that his agents had the authority to investigate the foundation, even if the Justice Department refused to authorize grand jury subpoenas.Mr. McCabe joined the F.B.I. after law school and rose quickly through the ranks. Mr. Comey groomed him for senior leadership from a young age, rankling some agents who saw him as too academic and not enough of a traditional crime-fighter. But senior F.B.I. officials and his counterparts in other agencies praised his intellect and ability to manage complicated worldwide national security issues.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/trump-white-house-anxiety.html","WASHINGTON — No one was fired at the White House on Friday.Which was news.Seeking to tamp down the anxiety inside the West Wing and the sense of never-ending dysfunction, President Trump refrained, dawn through dusk, from any firings-by-tweet. His chief of staff delivered a buck-’em-up message that no heads will roll — for now.Over at the Justice Department, Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired Andrew G. McCabe, the former F.B.I. deputy director and a frequent target of President Trump’s scorn, late Friday night. That was widely expected. But at the White House, the lack of any resolution to the steady reports of coming firings has left the president’s top advisers in limbo, and has undercut their authority.Some aides say they wake up each morning wondering if they will still have a job by the end of the day.Two embattled cabinet secretaries — Ben Carson at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and David J. Shulkin at the Department of Veterans Affairs — remained in their posts despite speculation that they would soon be replaced because of the president’s anger over their use of public funds.John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, who is himself reported to be on thin ice with the president, reassured senior members of the White House staff on Friday morning that “there were no immediate personnel changes at this time.” He urged officials to come to work focused on policy goals.Yet even as Mr. Kelly sought to project calm, he and other advisers struggled to explain conflicting indications that at some point, perhaps soon, Mr. Trump intends to fire Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, his second national security adviser. (Mr. Trump fired his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, after Mr. Flynn served 24 days in the job.) General McMaster’s dismissal would follow Mr. Trump’s firing this week of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson.Multiple White House officials have said that the president has decided to seek a new national security adviser, leading one online gambling site to give General McMaster the best odds at becoming the “next to be fired or resign from Donald Trump administration.”But during Friday morning’s national security briefing in the Oval Office, a White House official said, Mr. Trump told General McMaster, “You’re not going anywhere.” At a briefing for reporters, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, called General McMaster a “dedicated public servant” who has a “great working relationship” with Mr. Trump.Spotted Friday afternoon outside the West Wing, General McMaster told a reporter, “Everybody has got to leave the White House at some point.” Asked if he was leaving sooner rather than later, he said, “I’m doing my job.” Then he walked inside.Numerous White House officials said that General McMaster, whose job requires him to negotiate internal disputes among factions within the administration as well as deal directly with foreign officials on delicate topics, is operating with the expectation that every day may be his last.National security veterans expressed alarm, saying perceptions about the general’s job security would directly affect his ability to speak on behalf of the president when it comes to complicated issues like the North Korea nuclear negotiations. Others said General McMaster’s expected dismissal, along with the anticipated firings of the others, would further devastate White House morale.“You can imagine how people lower down feel,” said R. Nicholas Burns, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School and a former diplomat who worked for presidents of both parties. “They don’t know what is going to happen from one day to the next. They don’t know if their boss is going to be fired or not. You can’t have an effective government like this. It just won’t work.”People close to the president said Friday that the numerous reports of the general’s imminent demise — including a Washington Post article on Thursday night — along with the role Mr. Kelly was said to have in pushing for Mr. McMaster’s departure, caused the president to pull back, most likely giving General McMaster a reprieve of several weeks.Reacting to The Post late Thursday, Mr. Trump initially wanted to issue over-the-top praise of his national security adviser, aides said. But the aides persuaded him not to because of the voluminous reports of their strained relationship.On Capitol Hill, lawmakers in both parties remained largely silent about the White House churn, though Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a Republican who is retiring this year, called General McMaster “a stabilizing force” and expressed concern about his possible departure.Ms. Sanders insisted that the recent personnel moves were normal for any White House. In fact, a Brookings Institution study found a 46 percent turnover rate in the Trump White House for the most important jobs, compared with a 24 percent rate for President Barack Obama and 33 percent for President George W. Bush during the same period.Mr. Trump seems poised to increase his percentage soon.Attorney General Jeff Sessions remains at odds with the president, who has repeatedly — and publicly — demeaned him, leaving it an open question how much longer Mr. Sessions will stay.Mr. Kelly, too, is trying to run a White House under the dark cloud of reports that the president is also looking for a replacement for him. Chiefs of staff to previous presidents have said that uncertainty can only hobble Mr. Kelly’s ability to operate effectively.In an off-the-record conversation with reporters, disclosed by a reporter for Axios who did not attend, Mr. Kelly said no firings were imminent, but acknowledged that rumors may be coming from the president, who Mr. Kelly said talks to many people on the phone. Those people in turn talk to reporters, Mr. Kelly said.Several White House officials said that Mr. Trump is under pressure from advisers to “rip the Band-Aid off” by announcing any firings quickly, and all at once.Mr. Carson and Dr. Shulkin are the most vulnerable because of spending scandals at their departments, though officials close to the president said he is aware that it would be poor public relations to fire Mr. Carson, the highest-ranking African-American man in an overwhelmingly white administration.The president’s leading choice to replace Mr. Shulkin would most likely face difficulties being confirmed by the Senate. Pete Hegseth, a host of “Fox & Friends Weekend” and the former head of a veterans group, has ties to two major conservative donors, Charles G. and David H. Koch, who are anathema to Democrats.The Veterans Affairs inspector general issued a scathing report this year describing “serious derelictions” related to a trip Mr. Shulkin took last year to Britain and Denmark that cost more than $122,000. The report prompted bitter infighting among Mr. Shulkin and his top lieutenants and generated embarrassing headlines for the administration.Mr. Carson has been dogged by the continuing story of HUD’s purchase of a $31,000 dining set for his office. Mr. Carson initially claimed that neither he nor his wife, Candy, were involved in the selection of the dining room table, chairs and hutch when he was confronted with reports that the purchase far exceeded the $5,000 federal limit on office renovations.But this week, the department released emails showing that Mr. Carson and his wife were, in fact, involved, down to reviewing a dozen swatches of material used on the seats of the 10 chairs, each costing taxpayers $600 to $700.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/trump-mueller-dowd.html","WASHINGTON — A lawyer for President Trump said on Saturday that Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who is overseeing the special counsel’s investigation into ties between Russia and Mr. Trump’s campaign, should end the inquiry.The remark represented an extraordinary shift in the public strategy by the Trump legal team. For months, Mr. Trump’s advisers have urged the president to avoid any criticism of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and the president’s lawyers had done nothing publicly that could agitate Mr. Mueller’s team.The Trump lawyer, John Dowd, made the statement to The Daily Beast a day after Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired the deputy F.B.I. director, Andrew G. McCabe, who was among the first officials at the bureau to scrutinize the possible links between Russia and the Trump team.“I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the F.B.I. Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt dossier,” Mr. Dowd said in his statement.Mr. Dowd said he was speaking on behalf of the president. But in a subsequent statement issued on Saturday morning by Mr. Trump’s lawyers, Mr. Dowd backtracked, saying that he had been “speaking for myself, not the president.”He did not elaborate on why he was calling for the end of the investigation, saying only: “Just end it on the merits in light of recent revelations.”Attempts to reach Mr. Dowd were unsuccessful.In his statement to The Daily Beast, Mr. Dowd did not specifically mention Mr. Mueller. But the implication that he believed that he should be fired was unmistakable. Such a move would put intense pressure on Republicans in Congress to open an investigation into the action.Mr. Trump’s lawyers have worked to keep him from firing Mr. Mueller in the past. In June, the president ordered Mr. Mueller fired but ultimately backed down after the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to resign rather than carry out the directive, according to four people told of the matter.The president has faced a series of revelations this past week about the investigation, and one person close to the White House said the president was livid over a report in The New York Times that Mr. Mueller had subpoenaed his corporate records, including those related to Russia.Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Times in July that the special counsel would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family’s finances beyond any relationship with Russia. But his lawyers privately tried to play down the subpoena, in part to keep the president and his family calm.Mr. Dowd has been at the center of a string of embarrassing incidents in recent months. In December, he said he had written a tweet, posted by the president, that implied Mr. Trump knew that the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, had lied to the F.B.I. when Mr. Trump fired him.In September, Mr. Dowd was overheard by a Times reporter discussing details of a dispute inside the president’s legal team over lunch at a popular Washington steakhouse.Mr. Trump has a long history of using advisers to publicly float a message, giving himself some distance from it. Mr. Dowd was the first Trump lawyer to publicly suggest that the Russia inquiry had no merit.Mr. Dowd’s statement was immediately criticized by Democrats. “Mr. Dowd’s comments are yet another indication that the first instinct of @realDonaldTrump and his legal team is not to cooperate with Special Counsel Mueller, but to undermine him at every turn,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the top Senate Democrat, said in a tweet.“The president, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel’s investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans,” he added.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/climate/scott-pruitt-political-ambitions.html","WASHINGTON — The headline speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference’s annual showcase, the Ronald Reagan Dinner, have historically been rising stars in the Republican Party — firebrand pundits, prominent activists, future presidential candidates.Last month, it was Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.In the past year, Mr. Pruitt has emerged as a hero to President Trump’s supporters for his hand in rolling back environmental rules at an agency long disliked by farmers, the fossil fuel industry and the far right. And he has occasionally shocked his employees by criticizing the very agency he heads.“It was an agency that was weaponized against certain sectors of the economy,” Mr. Pruitt said to applause at the Reagan dinner.Now, people close to Mr. Pruitt say he is using his perch as Mr. Trump’s deregulatory czar to position himself for further political prominence — starting with a run for office in his home state of Oklahoma. He is widely viewed as a future candidate for senator or governor there, and Mr. Pruitt has made it known that if the president replaces his beleaguered attorney general, Jeff Sessions, he would be ready to step into the job.Mr. Pruitt’s national profile has soared. He has appeared on the cover of the prominent conservative magazines National Review and The Weekly Standard. And Mr. Trump has privately praised some of Mr. Pruitt’s more controversial proposals, such as his idea to stage “red team, blue team” debates of climate-change science.Mr. Pruitt has faced criticism, and received a reprimand from his boss, for spending more than $107,000 of public money on first-class air travel. But he remains a favorite of Mr. Trump’s, and after the past week of White House turmoil — with the president dismissing his secretary of state and intimating that a greater shake-up may follow — Mr. Pruitt appears to have job security that could work to his advantage over time.The endgame, say people who have spoken with Mr. Pruitt, is a possible run at the presidency in 2024 or later. “It was always known among elite Republicans that this guy had higher ambitions,” said Keith Gaddie, a professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma. “The question was just, ‘Does he want to be president, or does he want to be attorney general?’”To jump from E.P.A. chief to any of those posts would be highly unusual for the head of a historically wonky, low-profile agency. “The take has always been that E.P.A. is where your political career goes to die,” said William K. Reilly, who headed the agency under President George Bush.Even in Republican administrations, Mr. Reilly said, the job historically involved imposing regulations on polluting industries, which can create powerful enemies. “It’s the kind of job that if you do it right, you antagonize a lot of people — big industry, even your own president,” he said.But Mr. Pruitt has flipped the script. As Oklahoma’s attorney general, he sued the E.P.A. 14 times, and he has spent the past year working to undo regulations that would have required farmers to restrict their fertilizer use; oil and gas firms to control global warming pollution from their wells; and Midwestern power plants to burn less coal.“He has made a big splash,” Mr. Reilly said. “The mission he is on is not one that his predecessors at E.P.A. have recognized. And it could be a good strategy to win the constituency that elected the president.”Mr. Pruitt’s precise political path forward is not certain. He is viewed as a likely candidate to run for a Senate seat in Oklahoma in 2020 if the incumbent, James Inhofe, retires. But it remains unclear if Mr. Inhofe, 83, will do so, and his office declined to comment. There is also speculation that Mr. Pruitt might jump in as a last-minute candidate in this year’s governor’s race.When asked about its boss’s ambitions, Mr. Pruitt’s staff emphasizes that he is focused only on the job at hand. It also notes that the E.P.A. chief has made a significant effort to promote his work. “Administrator Pruitt has utilized a wide array of news outlets to advance President Trump’s agenda on regulatory certainty and environmental stewardship,” his spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, wrote in an email.Some former E.P.A. chiefs noted that Mr. Pruitt’s unusual speed at attempting to dismantle regulations could mean that those efforts might not stand up to later legal challenges. “The policies he’s pushing play very well in his home state and with the base — but you can’t do them overnight,” said Christine Todd Whitman, who headed the E.P.A. in the George W. Bush administration and before that was the governor of New Jersey. “They’re getting rushed out. I don’t think the homework is being done. It makes for good sound bites, but they might not stand up legally.”That might not affect Mr. Pruitt’s longer-term political aspirations, though. “Pruitt could be gone from E.P.A. the time that happens,” Ms. Whitman said.Among the largest regulations Mr. Pruitt aims to roll back, at Mr. Trump’s direction, is an Obama-era clean water rule, known as Waters of the United States, which would have restricted the chemical fertilizers used by farmers. The rule has been particularly unpopular with the rural voters who make up the core of Mr. Trump’s base. This year, Mr. Pruitt announced he would freeze implementation of the rule and issue a more farmer-friendly version by the spring.Last year, Mr. Pruitt made two trips to Iowa, a key campaign state in presidential elections, to talk about his agenda. In the summer, he met with farmers to tout his rollback of the clean water regulation. In December, he promised that the E.P.A. would not use regulations to curb the production of corn ethanol — an issue considered key for presidential candidates in Iowa.Mr. Pruitt has also halted implementation of Mr. Obama’s climate change rules, which would have frozen construction of new coal-fired power plants, and has said he intends to propose a replacement rule this year. Last April, he spoke at a Pennsylvania coal mine, telling workers that “the regulatory assault is over.”Behind the scenes, Mr. Pruitt has spent time with major political donors. Last year he met with Foster Friess, a Republican fund-raiser, and with investors connected to Sheldon Adelson, the party megadonor, according to meeting records obtained by The New York Times. He also met with Steven Chancellor, an Indiana coal executive and Republican fund-raiser, according to documents obtained by the Sierra Club and published by Politico.“All of this is unusual,” Ms. Whitman said. “If you’re in a federal position, you should not appear to be campaigning.”Were Mr. Inhofe, long known as Congress’s most vocal opponent of efforts to fight global warming, to retire, Mr. Pruitt would be a natural fit to try to win his Senate seat.Mr. Pruitt, who keeps his watch set to the time in Oklahoma even when he is working on the East Coast, has traveled to his home state regularly. Last March through May he spent 43 out of 92 days in Oklahoma or traveling to or from the state, according to a report by the Environmental Integrity Project.Mr. Pruitt’s rise to prominence in Oklahoma began during the eight years he managed and co-owned the Oklahoma City RedHawks, a minor league baseball team. He won a seat in the State Legislature and opened a small legal office, Christian Legal Services, to challenge government actions that he saw as compromising individual rights.As an owner of the RedHawks, Mr. Pruitt ran television ads that featured himself promoting the team. They gave him statewide recognition and played a role in his 2010 race for attorney general, said Chris Wilson, an Oklahoma-based Republican strategist who worked on the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. “He had instant name recognition,” Mr. Wilson said.As attorney general, Mr. Pruitt built close ties with the state’s oil and natural gas industry. A 2014 investigation by The Times found that energy lobbyists drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send to the E.P.A., on state stationery, outlining the economic hardship of environmental regulations on their industries.The ties have paid off politically. Harold G. Hamm, who advised the presidential campaigns of Mr. Trump and Mitt Romney and is the chief executive of Continental Resources, an Oklahoma oil and gas company, was a co-chairman of Mr. Pruitt’s 2013 re-election campaign.Mr. Pruitt’s tenure at the E.P.A. has already proven popular with the oil and natural gas industry. His proposals have been aimed at loosening regulations, particularly an Obama-era rule that would have required companies to rein in emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from new oil and gas wells. (A federal appeals court later ruled that the effort was illegal.)Energy companies were also delighted when Mr. Pruitt flew to Morocco in December, in an unusual trip aimed at promoting exports of natural gas. That trip received criticism, though, in part because the E.P.A. does not oversee natural gas exports.The E.P.A.’s inspector general is investigating some of Mr. Pruitt’s trips, including the one to Morocco and some to Oklahoma, but it is not clear whether that will be a liability. “It’s not great, but it’s not fatal,” Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who advised the Trump campaign, said referring to Mr. Pruitt’s airline expenses. “None of the old rules seem to apply,” he said. “The current president seems to have erased a lot of them.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/north-korea-cia-trump.html","WASHINGTON — The Central Intelligence Agency has emerged as the primary player in President Trump’s audacious diplomatic opening to North Korea, several officials said on Friday, conducting back-channel communications and taking a major role in planning Mr. Trump’s coming meeting with Kim Jong-un, the country’s ruler.The White House’s decision to use intelligence, rather than diplomatic, channels in communicating with the North Koreans speaks to the influence of Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director whom Mr. Trump chose this week to replace Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. It also reflects the State Department’s diminished role in preparing for the riskiest encounter between an American president and a foreign leader in many years.Mr. Pompeo, these officials said, has already been dealing with North Korean representatives through a channel that runs between the C.I.A. and its North Korean counterpart, the Reconnaissance General Bureau. And he has been in close touch with the director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, Suh Hoon, who American officials said brokered Mr. Kim’s invitation to Mr. Trump.The deep involvement of Mr. Pompeo, officials said, helps explain the timing of Mr. Tillerson’s ouster. Mr. Trump, having decided to accept Mr. Kim’s invitation to a meeting, wanted to have a secretary of state who was in lock step with his views, these people said.Mr. Tillerson was an early advocate of diplomatic engagement with North Korea, pursuing it as part of his efforts to win the release of Americans detained there. But he often leaned too far ahead of Mr. Trump in his eagerness, most notably when the president publicly undercut him during one of Mr. Tillerson’s trips to Beijing, tweeting that he was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.”Mr. Pompeo, a hawkish former Army officer and Republican congressman who has spoken about the possibility of regime change in North Korea, is viewed as more skeptical about engaging with Mr. Kim. It is not clear whether he advised the president in advance of his decision to accept the invitation to talk. But he is an astute reader of Mr. Trump’s preferences, and even before his nomination as secretary of state had become a vocal defender of the meeting.“President Trump isn’t doing this for theater,” he said last week on Fox News. “He’s going to solve a problem.”North Korea has still not publicly confirmed the meeting, a silence that has raised suspicions among some Korea experts about whether Mr. Kim really made the offer — or if he did, whether he agreed to halt nuclear and missile tests, and put his nuclear arsenal on the table, as part of a negotiation with the United States.On Friday, however, the White House appeared committed. Mr. Trump spoke with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who has pushed tirelessly for talks between North Korea and the United States, and reaffirmed his intention to meet Mr. Kim by the end of May.The administration struck a cautious note, saying in a statement, “Both leaders affirmed the importance of learning from the mistakes of the past, and pledged continued, close coordination to maintain maximum pressure on the North Korean regime.”But it added, “The two leaders expressed cautious optimism over recent developments and emphasized that a brighter future is available for North Korea, if it chooses the correct path.”Administration officials declined on Friday to say whether Washington had established direct communication with Pyongyang. Asked the same question earlier in the week, they said there had not yet been contact. A spokesman for the C.I.A. declined to comment on the agency’s role, referring questions to the White House.While a meeting of Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim would be one of the boldest diplomatic gambles of recent years, it was orchestrated largely by the intelligence services of the three countries.Officials said Mr. Suh, the South Korean spy chief, laid the groundwork for Mr. Kim’s invitation in negotiations and a subsequent meeting in Pyongyang with Kim Yong-chol, a powerful general who heads inter-Korean relations and used to run North Korea’s intelligence service.Kim Yong-chol led the North’s delegation to the closing ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, where he sat steps from Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka. The two did not speak.Mr. Suh was one of two South Korean envoys who visited the White House last week to brief Mr. Trump on their meeting with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang a few days earlier. But he was overshadowed by his colleague — Chung Eui-yong, the national security adviser — after the president instructed Mr. Chung to announce the meeting to reporters gathered in the White House driveway.Now that Mr. Pompeo has been promoted, officials said, the use of the intelligence channel is mostly a convenience. But he still needs to be confirmed by the Senate, a process that could take several weeks. By continuing to work through the C.I.A. channel, he can be involved in the planning while he awaits his move to the State Department.Some officials expressed concern about the C.I.A.’s taking the lead in orchestrating a leader-to-leader meeting — work that would normally be the province of the State Department.The intelligence officials on the North Korean side, they said, are unsavory figures, not least Kim Yong-chol himself, who is accused of masterminding the torpedo attack that sank a South Korean Navy ship in 2010, killing 46 sailors, and a deadly artillery attack on a South Korean island.Still, some diplomats said they were not concerned about the C.I.A.’s role, as long as the meeting did not get derailed. They pointed out that the State Department just lost its chief North Korea negotiator, Joseph Yun, who retired from the Foreign Service, in part because of his frustration with his agency’s diminished role.The National Security Council has assembled a working group, composed of officials from several agencies, to strategize ahead of the meeting. The group met for the first time this week, and one official said the White House was determined to include people who brought a range of views on North Korea.It is not the first time, officials noted, that intelligence agents have been involved in sensitive diplomacy with North Korea.In 2014, the director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper, traveled secretly to North Korea to negotiate the release of two Americans, Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller. He got the Americans out, but said afterward that the North Koreans were crestfallen that he did not bring with him an American proposal for a broader diplomatic breakthrough.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/bannon-republican-senate-primary-challengers.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump persuaded a conservative businessman in Nevada to drop his primary challenge to a sitting Republican senator on Friday, effectively ending a populist revolt that Stephen K. Bannon once promised would scorch establishment Republican senators from coast to coast this year.Danny Tarkanian, a perennial candidate who had Mr. Bannon’s backing, withdrew from his race against Senator Dean Heller after a tweet from the president.At Mr. Trump’s suggestion, he said he would run for an open seat in the House instead. His decision to drop out gives a significant boost to Mr. Heller, widely considered one of the most vulnerable Republican senators on the ballot this year.Earlier this week, another Bannon-backed candidate, the Mississippi state senator Chris McDaniel, dropped his challenge to Senator Roger Wicker, opting instead to run for the seat left open by the retirement of the state’s senior senator, Thad Cochran.By making clear he would support Mr. Heller and Mr. Wicker in their primaries, Mr. Trump effectively starved their challengers of the political oxygen they needed to win over conservative activists. In his tweet, Mr. Trump said it “would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada, and it’s unity” if Mr. Heller could run unopposed.In an interview, Mr. Tarkanian said he at first resisted Mr. Trump’s entreaties, which were conveyed to him by the president’s 2020 campaign manager, Brad Parscale. He said Mr. Trump had reached out to him by telephone last week, but the two never connected; he later told Mr. Parscale that if the president wanted him out, Mr. Trump should say so. So the president did, on Twitter.Mr. Tarkanian, whose father, Jerry Tarkanian, was a legendary basketball coach at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said he “did not think it was the right decision,” but he added: “I grew up in an athletic family. When the coach tells you to do something, many times you don’t agree with it, but it’s your responsibility to do it.”It was a striking illustration of how much Mr. Trump has tightened his grip on the Republican Party: It is difficult to take on the party establishment when the face of the party is a president beloved by primary voters.“This is one of those moments where the president of the United States has correctly and fully utilized the influence he has as the titular head of the Republican Party,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist who is close to Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. “It’s the hand of Donald Trump, recognizing that we cannot afford to lose Senate seats because we are fighting with ourselves.”By ending their primaries against the two senators, Mr. McDaniel and Mr. Tarkanian snuffed out what was left of Mr. Bannon’s vision for remaking Congress with candidates in his populist mold. At one time, Mr. Bannon envisioned primaries in Mississippi, Nebraska, Arizona, Wyoming and Nevada.Now he has none.With Mr. Bannon exiled by the president and Mr. Trump getting along with congressional leaders and taking counsel from largely mainstream Republicans in the post-Bannon White House, there is little political space for right-wing insurgents to oust incumbents.Perhaps no one is happier about that than Mr. McConnell, whom Mr. Bannon had once threatened to unseat. Chris Pack, the spokesman for the Senate Leadership Fund, a political action committee that Mr. McConnell helped found to ensure the re-election of incumbents, was succinct on Friday.“Who is Steve Bannon?” Mr. Pack asked wryly.Mr. Bannon declined to comment.Democrats said on Friday that the dynamics of the Nevada race had not changed much, and that they remained optimistic about their chances to pick up a Senate seat in a state won by Hillary Clinton. Mr. Tarkanian, party strategists said, has already caused lasting damage to Mr. Heller by forcing him into positions he will later regret in his campaign against Representative Jacky Rosen, the Democrat whose seat Mr. Tarkanian is now seeking. (Mr. Tarkanian lost to Ms. Rosen by about one percentage point in 2016.)Last year, for instance, Mr. Heller agonized for weeks over Republicans’ drive to repeal the Affordable Care Act, before finally siding with party leadership and voting to undo President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. Mr. Tarkanian pounced, accusing Mr. Heller of having “no convictions.” And Democrats are still reminding the senator of that vote.“Nevadans learned today what Senator Heller got for selling out their health care and putting himself and his party first,” Lauren Passalacqua, spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said on Friday, adding that “no amount of Trump tweets” could save him.While Mr. Trump is often described as the ultimate insurgent, he is driven far more by personal interaction and whether he feels respected than by any ideological impulses. Mr. Wicker and Mr. Heller have spent months courting the president and taking care to note, publicly and privately, that they are in his corner.Their lobbying paid off. Mr. Trump reiterated his support for Mr. Wicker when Mr. McDaniel got in the race late last month, and on Friday the president showed Mr. Tarkanian to the door. Mr. McDaniel and Mr. Tarkanian had little choice but to give up their primaries: They were trying to carry a sort of pre-Trump message that was focused on purifying the Senate of moderation, hoping to link the incumbents to a flaccid establishment embodied by Mr. McConnell.This approach proved effective at times during the Obama years and was nearly enough to lift Mr. McDaniel in 2014, when he came close to unseating Mr. Cochran.But while Mr. McConnell is deeply unpopular among rank-and-file conservatives, he is not the animating force in today’s party — Mr. Trump is. While the challengers could easily persuade primary voters to oppose Mr. McConnell’s preferred candidates, it is a far more difficult task to get them to oppose their president.The one Republican senator who may have lost his seat in a primary this year was the one who has become one of Mr. Trump’s most outspoken critics: Jeff Flake of Arizona, who is retiring. In that race, the establishment Republican, Representative Martha McSally, is facing a primary challenge from Joe Arpaio, the controversial former sheriff of Maricopa County, and Kelli Ward, an osteopathic physician and former state senator who drew backing from Mr. Bannon last fall.Yet in another sign of how he is veering closer to the congressional leadership, Mr. Trump has not offered support to either of the hard-liners, something White House officials assured Ms. McSally he would not do before she agreed to enter the race.And more recently, in another sign of Mr. Bannon’s diminished influence, Ms. Ward disavowed him. “I am distancing myself from Steve Bannon,” she told CNN in an interview in January, adding, “I support the president.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/trump-russia-administration-fact-check.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump has long avoided blaming — or even naming — Russia for meddling in the 2016 election that put him in office.But his administration has been far tougher on Moscow for cyberattacks that officials this week said not only sought to sway political opinions, but also wormed into power plants, aviation systems and other critical infrastructure in the United States and Europe.On Thursday, Mr. Trump was studiously silent as his administration imposed sanctions on Russia for interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign and what officials called other “malicious cyberattacks.” (The president did agree with a British assessment that Moscow was responsible for a nerve-gas attack in England against a former Russian spy and his daughter.)The Treasury Department said the sanctions were to punish “Russia’s continuing destabilizing activities.” And for the first time, the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. directly accused Russia of committing cyberattacks against “energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation and critical manufacturing sectors.”Last week, by contrast, Mr. Trump said that “the Russians had no impact on our votes whatsoever.”“But, certainly, there was meddling and probably there was meddling from other countries and maybe other individuals,” the president said at a March 6 news conference.This pattern of diversion has steadily increased since Mr. Trump took office. Here is a look back at how the president and his own administration have parted ways on Russia.February 2018: Deflecting accusations of Russian meddlingUnited States intelligence officials warned in mid-February that Russia had already begun meddling in the 2018 midterm elections. But Mr. Trump continued to suggest other countries could also be the culprit.“By the way, I have to say, Obama was the president during all of this meddling, or whatever you want to call it, with Russians and others possibly,” he said in a Feb. 24 interview on Fox News.December 2017: Conflicting signals on national security Mr. Trump’s first national security strategy blueprint made repeated references to Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and its “information operations as part of its offensive cyberefforts to influence public opinion across the globe.”Yet in his speech announcing the strategy on Dec. 18, Mr. Trump made one fleeting mention of Russia: of how it and China “seek to challenge American influence, values and wealth.” He made no mention of Russian meddling and instead praised intelligence sharing between Russia and the United States in the face of terrorism threats.August 2017: Signing a sanctions bill reluctantlyAfter Congress passed legislation in late July to impose sanctions on Russia and limit the president’s authority to lift them, Mr. Trump signed the bill but criticized it as “seriously flawed — particularly because it encroaches on the executive branch’s authority to negotiate.”Mr. Trump signed the legislation on Aug. 2. Several days earlier, President Vladimir V. Putin’s government had retaliated by seizing two American diplomatic compounds in Russia and telling the United States Embassy in Moscow to reduce its staff across the country. Mr. Trump did not respond, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, declined to comment.However, the State Department described Moscow’s move as “a regrettable and uncalled-for act.”“We are assessing the impact of such a limitation and how we will respond to it,” the department said in a statement.July 2017: Suggesting he found Mr. Putin’s denial persuasiveAfter Mr. Trump met with Mr. Putin during a Group of 20 summit meeting, he recounted the Russian leader’s assurances that Moscow did not intervene in the 2016 election.“First question — first 20, 25 minutes — I said, ‘Did you do it?’ He said, ‘No, I did not, absolutely not.’ I then asked him a second time, in a totally different way. He said, ‘Absolutely not,’” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Reuters that was published on July 12. “Somebody did say if he did do it, you wouldn’t have found out about it. Which is a very interesting point.”January 2017: Playing down Russian cyberattacksOn Jan. 6, the intelligence community released a declassified report of its conclusions about a Russian cyberattack on the election. In a statement about his briefing on the cyberattacks that day, Mr. Trump pointed to “Russia, China, other countries.”Days before his inauguration, at a Jan. 11 news conference where he was asked whether he believed Mr. Putin ordered the hacking of American political committees, Mr. Trump said that “as far as hacking, I think it was Russia.”He then added, “But I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.”Mr. Trump’s dismissiveness of accusations of Russian interference predates his time in the White House.Late December 2016: Praising Putin in the wake of sanctionsOn Dec. 29, President Barack Obama issued sanctions against Russia and ejected 35 suspected Russian intelligence operators from the United States as punishment for Moscow’s attempts to influence the election. But in a move widely believed to be aimed at fostering good relations with the incoming Trump administration, Mr. Putin announced on Dec. 30 that he would not retaliate.Mr. Trump promptly praised Mr. Putin’s decision.A day later, Mr. Trump said he still wasn’t convinced that Russia had interfered in the election, telling reporters: “And I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else.”Early December 2016: Disparaging intelligence agencies after reports on Russian interferenceAfter reports in December by the The New York Times and The Washington Post that United States intelligence assessments had concluded that Russian election meddling sought to aid Mr. Trump, the president-elect disagreed.In an unsigned statement responding to the news, the Trump transition team dismissed the assessment by comparing it to flawed intelligence reports in the lead-up to the Iraq war.“These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,” the statement said.October 2016: Questioning intelligence consensus that Russia is to blameOn Oct. 7, the United States intelligence community released a joint public statement saying it was “confident that the Russian government” had directed cyberattacks on American individuals and institutions, including political organizations such as the Democratic National Committee.Three days after that, during the second presidential debate, Mr. Trump again cast doubt that Russia was responsible — or even that there was a cyberattack in the first place.“Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they’re trying to tarnish me with Russia,” he said.September 2016: Continuing to cast doubt on Russian meddlingAs the official nominees of their parties, Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton began receiving intelligence reports in early August. On Sept. 22, top Democrats on the House and Senate Intelligence Committees issued a statement saying that they had “concluded that the Russian intelligence agencies are making a serious and concerted effort to influence the U.S. election,” based on briefings they had received.Four days later, during the first presidential debate, Mr. Trump said, “I don’t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the D.N.C.”He continued: “I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, O.K.?”June 2016: Rejecting the D.N.C. claim that Russian hackers penetrated its filesThe Democratic National Committee and a cybersecurity firm said that Russian hackers had obtained a trove of internal campaign emails and political opposition research.In response, Mr. Trump suggested that the D.N.C. fabricated the story or hacked itself: “We believe it was the D.N.C. that did the ‘hacking’ as a way to distract from the many issues facing their deeply flawed candidate and failed party leader,” he said in a campaign statement on June 15.He did not mention Russia.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/business/media/trump-kudlow-hegseth-television.html","The consternation came swiftly: How could the president pick a newsman — a television reporter, no less — for a government role of serious power and influence?“Outrageous,” groused one European diplomat. Critics accused the White House of being media-obsessed, led by a president more focused on burnishing his image than pursuing policy goals.Yet the job ultimately went to the television guy: the ABC News correspondent John A. Scali, who in 1973 was confirmed as President Richard M. Nixon’s ambassador to the United Nations.He was not the only small-screen figure courted by Nixon’s circle. “Henry Kissinger asked me to be his under secretary for whatever the hell the press was called in those days,” Ted Koppel, the onetime “Nightline” host, recalled in an interview. “I must say I was interested.”Mr. Koppel did not accept — “I wasn’t designed to be a diplomat” — but nowadays a similar role is occupied by Heather Nauert, a former “Fox & Friends” anchor, who on Tuesday was named the State Department’s under secretary for public diplomacy and public affairs.Ms. Nauert is just one of the as-seen-on-TV faces now starring in President Trump’s White House. And the cast is set to grow.The television pundit Larry Kudlow, best known for his patter on CNBC, was named on Wednesday as Mr. Trump’s chief economic adviser. Pete Hegseth, a co-host of “Fox & Friends Weekend,” is on the short list to become secretary of veterans affairs. John R. Bolton, the former United Nations ambassador and a frequent Fox News commentator, is under consideration for national security adviser.The moves are another sign that the dividing line between media and government has been all but erased under Mr. Trump, a former reality star who views himself as the casting agent in chief.Television figures have served as press aides in past administrations, tasked with handling their former colleagues in the media. But the selection of Mr. Kudlow crossed a threshold of sorts: the elevation of a television star to a position of real influence over policies affecting millions of Americans.It was perhaps inevitable that Mr. Trump, whose view of the world is indelibly shaped by what he sees on TV, would be a president eager to break the fourth wall.People close to him have said a major part of his deliberative process is how a decision will play on cable news. Where previous presidents courted news personalities, Mr. Trump consults them, seeking policy and strategic advice from Fox News hosts like Jeanine Pirro, who at one point was interviewed for the job of deputy attorney general, and Sean Hannity.At least three Fox News hosts — Tucker Carlson, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Laura Ingraham — were approached about joining his communications team. Last week, Mr. Trump dined at the White House with Jesse Watters, the Fox News co-host of “The Five,” who is best known for ambush interviews and an offensive video mocking Asian-Americans, for which he later apologized.Now Mr. Trump is inviting the commentators to shape the policy they comment on. Mr. Hegseth, if hired for the veterans affairs job, would be in charge of reforming a bureaucracy that administers benefits to millions.Mr. Kudlow, a zealous advocate of lowering taxes on the wealthy, will be expected to forge an economic policy that, until this week, he had the luxury of merely judging from the safe harbor of a television studio.In a hall-of-mirrors moment on Wednesday, Mr. Kudlow went on television to describe how Mr. Trump was impressed with how he appeared on television.“He said, ‘You’re on the air,’ and he said, ‘I’m looking at a picture of you,’ and he said, ‘Very handsome,’” Mr. Kudlow said during a chummy interview with his soon-to-be-former CNBC colleagues. He let out a laugh: “So Trumpian!”Installing the TV crowd in this West Wing could play out in unpredictable ways.The administration spurred an international incident last year after Sean Spicer, its press secretary at the time, repeated an unsupported accusation about a British spy agency’s wiretapping of the Trump campaign. The source? Andrew Napolitano, the TV judge and Fox News legal analyst, who made the claim on “Fox & Friends.”Mr. Napolitano — who also met with Mr. Trump to discuss potential Supreme Court candidates — had heard the rumor from a conspiracy theorist known for spreading hoaxes. Mr. Trump later defended Mr. Napolitano, saying, “All we did was quote a very talented legal mind.”Then came the incident involving Omarosa Manigault Newman, who made a name for herself as the villain of Mr. Trump’s “The Apprentice” in 2004 and lasted a year in the administration as director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison.After she left her position, the reality-show presidency collided with an actual reality show: Ms. Newman joined the cast of “Celebrity Big Brother” and impugned the Trump administration as “so bad.”The White House decided to respond — on live television. “Omarosa was fired three times on ‘The Apprentice,’ and this was the fourth time we let her go,” a deputy press secretary, Raj Shah, said during a White House briefing. (Unsurprisingly, after the back-and-forth, the ratings for “Big Brother” went up.)The empty-calorie genres of reality shows and cable punditry, which fill the hours with ginned-up conflict, can be a strange fit for the more consequential environment of the White House. The Newman uproar, in particular, seemed to knock some of Washington’s more levelheaded commentators off kilter.“It feels like we have reached a level of crazy in this White House, and it is difficult to take it anymore,” Chuck Todd said on MSNBC after Mr. Shah’s comments.Mr. Kudlow’s arrival in Washington could cause similar anxiety.The CNBC host’s smooth demeanor is catnip for the image-focused Mr. Trump, who chose Mr. Kudlow despite his opposition to tariffs authorized by the White House this month. But Mr. Kudlow is more familiar with television lights than the glare that comes with public service; his Washington experience is largely limited to a 1980s stint as a bureaucrat in Ronald Reagan’s Office of Management and Budget.His predecessors who led the National Economic Council include Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary, and Gary D. Cohn, a former president of Goldman Sachs.In 1972, when Nixon nominated Mr. Scali for his ambassadorship, he was choosing someone who had spent a year in the White House as an image consultant. Mr. Scali had also played a diplomatic role in managing the Cuban missile crisis, acting as a covert liaison between Soviet officials in Washington and the Kennedy administration.Still, the choice of Mr. Scali had its detractors: News of his nomination prompted a New York Times editorial that denounced the “downgrading of the United Nations” and asked why Nixon had picked him “to fill a position once held with distinction by Adlai E. Stevenson.”Mr. Kudlow offers another test case for how a TV personality can make the transition. But he will have to contend with one of Mr. Trump’s peculiar traits: The president often prefers the pundits he watches on television to the advisers who work in his West Wing.“He got hired because the president has seen him on TV,” Alex Conant, a Republican strategist in Washington, said. “To stay hired, he’s going to have to continue to be on TV. A lot.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/trump-cabinet.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump made no immediate moves on Friday to dismiss members of his administration, despite continuing reports of an impending shake-up that have unsettled the White House.Two embattled cabinet secretaries — Ben Carson at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and David Shulkin at the Department of Veterans Affairs — remained in their posts despite speculation that they would be replaced because of the president’s unhappiness with their use of public funds.John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, met at the White House with Mr. Carson on Friday morning, but no announcement was made about Mr. Carson’s future or Mr. Shulkin’s.There have also been conflicting indications that Mr. Trump — at some point — intends to fire Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, his second national security adviser, after the dismissal this week of Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson.Multiple White House officials have said that the president has decided to seek a new national security adviser. But during Friday morning’s national security briefing in the Oval Office, an official said, Mr. Trump told General McMaster, “You’re not going anywhere.”In a briefing for reporters later in the day, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, reiterated what she said in a Twitter post on Thursday night — that reports of General McMaster’s imminent firing were not true.“We don’t have any personnel changes at this time,” Ms. Sanders said, calling General McMaster a “dedicated public servant” who has a “great relationship” with Mr. Trump. She said the president told her he has no intention of firing him.The absence of any formal announcements — or firings by presidential tweet — suggested that the White House was seeking to tamp down the anxiety inside the West Wing and the impression that the Trump administration is gripped by dysfunction.Ms. Sanders said that Mr. Kelly had reassured senior members of the White House staff on Friday morning that “there were no immediate personnel changes at this time,” and had urged officials to come to work focused on the policy goals ahead.She said senior staff members passed that message on to others working in the West Wing in an attempt to diminish concerns about the record level of churn in the White House.“Our focus is not on a lot of the news stories that you guys would like us to be focused on,” she said.But the lack of any resolution to the reports of coming firings is leaving many of the president’s top advisers in a kind of political limbo that threatens to undermine their effectiveness until their fates are revealed, one way or the other.General McMaster, whose job requires him to negotiate internal disputes among factions within the administration, as well as deal directly with foreign officials, is operating with the public expectation that every day may be his last.Attorney General Jeff Sessions remains at odds with the president, who has repeatedly — and publicly — demeaned his tenure at the head of the Justice Department, leaving it an open question how much longer he will remain in charge.Mr. Kelly, too, is trying to run a White House under the cloud of reports that the president is looking for a replacement. Chiefs of staff to previous presidents have said that uncertainty is likely to hobble Mr. Kelly’s ability to operate effectively.And both Mr. Carson and Mr. Shulkin are presiding over complex departments, and those efforts are likely to be more difficult if career officials and outside interest groups believe they could soon be ousted.The Veterans Affairs inspector general issued a scathing report this year describing “serious derelictions” related to a trip Mr. Shulkin took last year to Britain and Denmark that cost more than $122,000. The report prompted bitter infighting within the department among Mr. Shulkin and his top lieutenants, generating politically damaging headlines for the administration.Mr. Carson, the highest-ranking African-American man in an overwhelmingly white administration, had been dogged by the continuing story of HUD’s purchase of a $31,000 dining set for his office. Mr. Carson initially claimed that neither he nor his wife, Candy, were involved in the selection of the dining room table, chairs and hutch when he was confronted with reports that the purchase far exceeded the $5,000 federal limit on office renovations.But this week, the department released emails showing that Mr. Carson and his wife were, in fact, involved, down to reviewing a dozen swatches of material used on the seats of the 10 chairs, each costing taxpayers $600 to $700.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/us/politics/tillerson-pompeo-secretary-state.html","President Trump fired his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, with a tweet this week.Experts, and news reports, have emphasized the unusual nature of Mr. Trump’s relationship with a secretary who reportedly called him a moron — and never denied it.But Mr. Tillerson’s difficulties during his unusually short term also illustrate how the job has changed in recent years. We spoke to several experts and looked at past coverage to explore here how the role was transformed after World War II.The most powerful role in the cabinet?The secretary of state, fourth in line to the presidency, was once considered the most powerful cabinet post. With four exceptions, they have always been white men, starting with Thomas Jefferson, the first to hold the position, in 1790.Many others would go on to be president including James Madison (the fifth), James Monroe (the seventh) and Martin Van Buren (the 10th). Others, like Edmund Muskie, William H. Seward and William Jennings Bryan, aspired to the top job but never won the presidency. And still others are names that might register only with a historian or a trivia buff, like Philander Chase Knox (1909-1913) or Edward Reilly Stettinus (1944-1945).Much of the modern history of the role has been defined by America’s struggle with the Soviet Union. In the years after World War II, various secretaries of state, including George C. Marshall, Dean Acheson and John Foster Dulles, were instrumental in dictating the nation’s foreign policy as the Cold War began to take shape.That struggle also included smaller regional conflicts, most notably in Vietnam, where Dean Rusk, John F. Kennedy’s secretary of state, was initially reluctant to intervene. He was eventually moved to defend the United States’ interference in the country’s affairs.For many, the swashbuckling realpolitik image of the role was fashioned by Henry Kissinger, the German-born diplomat who as secretary of state to Richard Nixon steered the United States toward rapprochement with China.But experts we spoke to were conflicted about whether Mr. Kissinger deserved that credit. He was acknowledged as being seen as a top foreign policy mind, but some argued that he had helped to destroy domestic good will toward American foreign policy during his time in the office. (He is also held in low regard by many on the left, who accuse of him of being a war criminal.)George P. Shultz and the Soviet UnionThe experts we interviewed instead selected George P. Shultz, Ronald Reagan’s longest-serving secretary of state, as perhaps the most effective of the Cold War secretaries.Steve Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview this week that Mr. Shultz was the last secretary of state to really dominate U.S. foreign policy, managing an ever-shifting relationship with the Soviet Union while also tending to policy in East Asia, Latin America and southern Africa.“Shultz was secretary of state for six and a half years and the difference showed,” Mr. Sestanovich said. “He had an authority and a kind of impact on issues that’s much harder to have in the short term.”When the Soviet Union struck a belligerent pose in the early 1980s, Mr. Shultz worked to keep Western European countries unified against the threat. Later in the decade, he succeeded in bringing about perhaps his greatest achievement, the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a pact signed by Mr. Reagan and the Soviet Union leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in 1987 that reduced the size of each country’s nuclear arsenal.Walter LaFeber, a professor emeritus of American history at Cornell University, said that Mr. Shultz was able to offer the United States a sense of continuity when Ronald Reagan began to slip intellectually, and he did so without alienating the president or his wife, Nancy Reagan, a key power broker within his administration.Mr. Shultz “was dealing with a president that was not fully versed on foreign policy,” Professor LaFeber said. “Reagan trusted Shultz.”Madeleine Albright and the Multi-Polar WorldAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States found itself in a position it had never previously held, as the world’s sole superpower.Tensions with the Soviets had informed the country’s foreign policy since the end of World War II. Secretaries of state had to reshape that policy in a world in which it could not define itself against an “evil empire.” Furthermore, the information revolution was beginning to bring what were once far-flung nations closer together.Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, argued that this combination of a multipolar world and new communications technology meant that the secretary of state was now charged with both producing a coherent vision that could advance the country’s interests while managing inside the department even more — which also meant more air travel than ever before.But she and others said that Madeleine K. Albright, Bill Clinton’s second secretary of state and the first woman to hold the post, largely succeeded in managing this new world.“Albright understood that in the post-Cold War world, what she needed to do was project the U.S. as the arbiter of the free world in a very different way,” Ms. Kleinfeld said. “Human rights, democracy, rule of law, these were the organizing principles that would allow the U.S. to keep an alliance system in a world where the old order had broken down.”Ms. Albright was able to project U.S. power, by couching that power in values that could be pitched as having won the war. But she was not a woolly liberal, Ms. Kleinfeld said. She interfered in other countries’ affairs, promoting human rights in China. She set up military exercises in the former Soviet Union and encouraged former Soviet engineers to work for the United States. She even visited North Korea in 2000 to attempt to persuade the Kim regime to end its missile tests.“She did very specific things to make the world safer by using the banner of liberal values,” Ms. Kleinfeld said.It was in this era that the secretary of state found herself contending with the heads of other agencies that had increasing had their own interests overseas. That competition within the cabinet has only increased in the last 20 years.Powell, Rice, Clinton and KerryUnder George W. Bush and Barack Obama, secretaries of state found themselves jockeying for control of policy with the heads of other agencies, including the Department of Justice and the Department of the Treasury and the Pentagon, as well as the White House itself.Those agencies’ involvement in overseas decision-making only deepened after Sept. 11, which drove home the risks of nonstate actors like Al Qaeda and prompted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.“Military issues form a larger part of the foreign policy portfolio,” Mr. Sestanovich said of this period. “And that means the secretary of state is not exactly playing catch-up but always needs to reassert the important of diplomacy.”Asked about Mr. Bush’s two secretaries, Colin L. Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and Mr. Obama’s, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, Mr. Sestanovich said, “You have to say that these are all secretaries of state that had some trouble getting control of policy for themselves.”Even Mr. Powell, whom Ms. Kleinfeld said may have been the strongest of the four in managing the State Department itself, was betrayed by conflicting interests within the executive branch when he delivered a detailed description of Iraqi weapons programs that did not exist to the United Nations in 2003. The speech relied on information that some intelligence agents knew was unreliable. Mr. Powell, a former general and the first African-American to hold the post, later described the speech as a “blot” on his record.Mr. Tillerson’s tensions with Mr. Trump can be seen as a part of that lineage. But Professor LaFeber emphasized that the public mistrust between the two was an anomaly. He could think of only one other example in American history of a similar relationship, between Abraham Lincoln and his secretary of state, William H. Seward.“Seward’s view of Lincoln is like Tillerson’s view of Trump,” Mr. LaFeber said. “When he called Trump a moron, I think that was from the heart.”He said that that was what Mr. Seward had initially thought of President Lincoln, “not a moron, but a person unversed in foreign policy.”Still, Mr. LaFeber warned, even that historical precedent did not quite help to illuminate Mr. Trump’s relationship with his first secretary of state.While Mr. Tillerson was thought by many to have mismanaged the State Department and contributed to his own irrelevance within the administration, Professor LaFeber said that he had been actively trying to remedy problems that the United States was confronting, problems that Mr. Trump was exacerbating.“If you evaluate presidents, you have to evaluate the first 44 and put Trump into another category entirely,” he said. “He’s so different, so ignorant of so many issues, particularly foreign policy. And Tillerson is a victim of that.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/technology/att-time-warner-antitrust.html","WASHINGTON — How you watch “Game of Thrones” and CNN is about to have its day in court.The Justice Department’s bid to block AT&T’s $85 billion merger with Time Warner is set to head to trial next week, in one of the most anticipated antitrust battles in years.The deal, if approved, would create a media giant that combines AT&T’s nationwide mobile and satellite distribution networks with Time Warner’s huge collection of popular movies and television offerings, including “Game of Thrones” on HBO, news on CNN and college and professional basketball on TNT. The central question of the trial: Would that combination hurt consumers or help them?How the judge rules in the case has the potential to shape the fast-changing business of video, as consumers increasing turn to streaming services instead of traditional cable TV. AT&T, a nationwide satellite TV and wireless provider, argues that pairing up with a major content company is necessary to compete against the reach and resources of tech giants like Netflix and Amazon. But the Justice Department says the deal would hurt upstart streaming services and lead to higher prices for consumers.The decision will frame the competition among Silicon Valley, Hollywood and Madison Avenue, while also establishing what kinds of corporate mergers — in the media industry and beyond — will be permitted in the years to come.“This court case is so important it is hard to know where to start,” said Amy Yong, a research analyst at the investment firm Macquarie. “This case is at the heart of what we do in our everyday lives.”The Justice Department’s move to block the deal in November took Wall Street and the entertainment industry by surprise. Many executives and lawyers thought President Trump’s administration would usher in a hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement, despite Mr. Trump’s criticism of the deal on the campaign trail.Instead, the Justice Department, under its antitrust chief Makan Delrahim, moved aggressively, demanding the sale of major parts of the businesses before a deal could go through. AT&T responded by suggesting that Mr. Delrahim’s decision was politically motivated and not based on established antitrust law.In recent weeks, though, the judge overseeing the case, Richard Leon of the United States District Court of the District of Columbia, has rejected moves by AT&T to inject politics into the arguments.Unless the two sides settle — and there have been no signs of that happening — the trial is expected to showcase two starkly different visions of the country’s video future. Drama is also in the cards: Executives from AT&T and Time Warner, as well as competing cable, satellite, tech and media firms, are expected to take the stand over the course of several weeks — and possibly reveal details about the inner workings of the industry.The Justice Department argues that the merged company’s combination of distribution and content would give it too much leverage in negotiations with the rest of the industry. It also says that the new company would demand higher licensing fees from other cable and satellite firms for what the government calls “must-watch” programming. Those higher charges would immediately trickle down to consumers at an estimated cost of 45 cents a month, or a combined $436 million annually for cable and satellite subscribers, the agency said.The government’s case will be led by Craig Conrath, a plain-spoken and longtime litigator who has worked on merger cases for several administrations. He is expected to argue that if the merger is approved, AT&T and Comcast, a corporation that owns distribution and programming — the same combination that AT&T is seeking — would have the incentive to raise prices for access to their shows. That would hurt other cable companies and online streaming businesses.Judge Leon oversaw the final approval of Comcast’s merger with NBC Universal in 2011, the deal that added programming to Comcast’s holdings.“Either important video content will be available through a competitive market to all distributors, including up-and-coming innovators,” the Justice Department said in pretrial filings with the court. “Or it will likely only be available through vertically integrated, well-funded silos.”AT&T scoffs at the government’s predictions of price increases. And even if the analysis is accurate, the company has said, it would amount to the price of a fancy cup of coffee for each consumer. Contrary to the government’s theory that it would withhold content, AT&T says it wants to make sure its shows and movies are as widely distributed as possible.Leading AT&T’s defense is Daniel Petrocelli, a Los Angeles-based lawyer with a long track record in high-profile cases but not someone who is considered an antitrust expert. Two decades ago, he won a wrongful death case against O. J. Simpson on behalf of the family of Ron Goldman. In 2006, he lost a case defending Jeffrey Skilling, the chief executive of Enron, of fraud and conspiracy.Mr. Petrocelli is expected to argue that the government is missing the bigger picture. AT&T says that Silicon Valley companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Google have disrupted the entertainment industry by spending billions of dollars a year on original content and pushing the programming through their own distribution systems. Facebook and Google dominate the market for advertisements that run with those videos.AT&T argues that a merger with Time Warner would add a new competitor against those giants, instead of reducing competition. AT&T will also promise to work out any contract disputes with cable and satellite companies through a third-party arbitrator, he is expected to argue.“The new video revolution is defined by the spectacular rise of Netflix, Amazon, Google and other vertically integrated, direct-to-consumer technology companies,” AT&T said in its pretrial brief.The merger is opposed by several Democratic lawmakers and many consumer groups, who say that AT&T’s control of more than 100 million mobile phone subscriptions gives it unparalleled power. Google, Facebook and Netflix, though mighty, don’t own the pipes that connect people to the internet, they say.Streaming competition is the “best hope consumers have, but network operators will kill that competition if they are not stopped,” said Mark Cooper, the director of research at the Consumer Federation of America.Many Wall Street analysts, however, say the government’s intervention in the deal will eventually harm consumers, because it will limit true competitors to the big tech companies.“The government is about three years behind reality and is defining the marketplace as it was about three years ago,” said Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Company.AT&T had asked for detailed communications logs between the White House and Justice Department staff members, including Mr. Delrahim, a former Trump White House lawyer. Judge Leon rejected those demands, and AT&T ultimately decided to exclude its concerns of potential presidential interference — which it described as “selective enforcement” — from the case.But even without arguments of political interference entering the trial, many on Wall Street will be looking for clues about the kinds of corporate deals that will pass muster during the Trump administration.The decision to block a merger between companies that don’t directly compete is rare. Mr. Delrahim has said that one of the common regulatory remedies to prevent anticompetitive behavior in such deals — getting companies to promise they’ll be on their best behavior — is not effective.That view may ripple across merger and acquisition plans in other sectors, including the drugstore chain CVS’s $69 billion bid for the health insurance provider Aetna — as well as proposed media deals like Disney’s acquisition of Fox and Sinclair Broadcasting’s purchase of Tribune Media. Wall Street analysts expect the results of the trial will determine if more telecom and entertainment companies will pursue ambitious vertical mergers.“This could direct the future path of the industry,” said Steven Salop, a professor of economics and law at Georgetown University Law School. “If it is permitted, vertical integration will continue.”

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/17/593643801/black-voters-need-more-convincing-from-democrats-in-2018","When Koya Graham turned 18, the first thing she did was register to vote.And, year after year, the Cleveland native faithfully voted for Democrats — that is, until the 2016 presidential election.""I'm not interested anymore,"" Graham told NPR in the Spring of 2016. ""I don't see any immediate, significant changes happening.""And Graham was not alone. It's been estimated that millions of people who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 stayed home in 2016. A recent analysis in The New York Times puts the exact figure at 4.4 million — and approximates that an outsized number of those non-voters (36 percent) were black.Black voter turnout fell seven percentage points in the last election, plummeting from 66.6 percent in 2012 to 59.6 percent in 2016, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Many analysts say a natural drop-off was expected in the post-Barack Obama era. But the 2016 voter turnout for African-Americans was not just lower than the Obama years, it was even slightly lower than the 2004 election between George W. Bush and John Kerry.One key question this political season is whether African-Americans still feel they have a home in the Democratic Party — a party that has relied on their votes for decades.Graham, now 38, insists she has no regrets for bypassing the election.She said the Trump presidency has kind of turned out to be a blessing in disguise.""I think for our people, for my people, this is probably the best thing that could have happened,"" she said at a coffee shop in Cleveland. ""The veil has been lifted.""Graham said the country's underbelly of racism is being exposed. ""We've always had our blinders on ... and even though it's unfortunate where we are now, I'm glad that it has happened because America is being seen for the country that it is.""Kelton Latson, another non-voter NPR first met in 2016, agrees.""Now people can wake up,"" he said. ""Black people have been voting for over 50 years, and nothing has ever changed. Our communities still look the same. We're still at the bottom of the economic poll.""Latson didn't vote in 2016 and said a number of his friends didn't vote either, for similar reasons. The 26-year-old — who likes to quote Malcolm X and sports the activist's signature style of horn rimmed glasses — said he has no intention of voting in 2018. He no longer sees voting as an effective way to change the system, he said — but adds that his apathy toward voting is a personal opinion and perhaps voting works for other people.""I'm not saying you shouldn't vote,"" Latson said. ""You just need to be more cautious with your vote and stop being willing to just throw a ballot out there off of emotion.""Voting — but still frustrated The frustration isn't limited to non-voters. Even some young African-Americans who cast a ballot in 2016 and are working within traditional party politics say Democrats seem to take black votes for granted. And they're tired of that relationship.""They just kind of expect us to jump on board,"" said Ifeolu Claytor, a 23-year-old working with the Ohio Young Black Democrats. ""And that's something that needs to change, clearly, cause black millennials will just stay at home. It's not 1980 where people are still kind of fresh, like, 'oh, our parents just got the right to vote.'""Claytor also said the party seems too focused on courting middle class white voters.""Focusing on WASPy [white anglo-saxon protestant], middle class issues is not going to win in 2018 or 2020,"" he said. Claytor added that a lot of black people feel left behind by the Democratic Party: They want to hear more about criminal justice reform and wealth disparity from politicians. Gabrielle Jackson, the president of the Northeast Ohio Young Black Democrats, said she understands Claytor's frustration, but that the situation is improving. ""We've had almost every gubernatorial candidate ... come talk to us about our issues,"" she said. ""[In 2016] Democrats didn't do that. They refused to talk to us in a lot of cases... These people are recognizing that in order to win, you cannot ignore us, and if you do, you will lose.""Convincing the base Part of voter turnout is about speaking to the issues that matter most to voters. But another key component is mobilization.In both the Virginia gubernatorial race and the Alabama senate race in 2017, black voters were specifically courted and mobilized; and post-election analysis suggests black voters, particularly black women, were key to the Democrats' victories in both states.""In Alabama, we knocked on about 500,000 doors,"" said Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, a superPAC that worked with partners on the ground to mobilize voters. ""We talked to people on their doors. Both in Alabama and Virginia — ran canvass programs where people from the community were out talking to their neighbors.""The lesson from the Alabama mobilization strategy was that you can never have too much voter contact — organizers contacted voters early and often, they weren't merely dropping off pamphlets three weeks before election day. And a bulk of the outreach was done on a grassroots level.According to Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University, Democrats need to critically reconsider whether their traditional mobilization efforts are sufficient.Part of the problem, she said, is that because black voters are considered a base voter for the Democratic party — meaning there's an assumption that an overwhelming majority of African-Americans will vote Democratic — they are often overlooked.""There is a tendency for the Democratic Party to focus on other groups where the margin is actually going to be more narrow,"" Gillespie said.And as a result, Gillespie sees, even loyal Democrats feel there's a tendency to ""paper over"" concerns that matter most to black voters.""It's not just a 2016 problem. It's not just a 2018 problem,"" she said. ""It is the type of thing that sparked the candidacy of Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988... it was the kind of thing that precipitated Maxine Waters threatening to walk out of the DNC in 2000... it was the kind of thing that spurred Al Sharpton's candidacy in 2004.""There's an assumption that black voters don't need to be persuaded to vote for Democrats. But Shropshire said they do.""Black voters, in particular, want to understand how Democrats are gonna to address a whole range of racial justice issues, and so running away from those issues is a non-starter,"" she said.Beyond traditional Democratic policies around the economy and healthcare, some of the voters NPR talked to say they want to hear candidates talking about criminal justice reform or racial tension.""The anti-Trump sentiment is not enough, we have to tell people what to vote for, who to vote for,"" said Quentin James, founder of Collective PAC, an organization working to get black candidates into elected office.In 2016, despite the dip in turnout, African-Americans still overwhelmingly voted Democrat, so there's no realistic assumption they will shift to the Republican party en masse this November.Shropshire said the fear is that they'll just stay home."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/16/593487330/conservatives-mobilize-grass-roots-activists-to-promote-trump-judges","Updated at 3:45 p.m. ETA conservative group funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch is turning its attention to a new front: promoting federal judges at the grass-roots level. Americans for Prosperity is willing to spend nearly $1 million to confirm judges this year. Those lifetime appointments could reshape the courts for a generation.""The fact of the matter is that so much of what affects us in our daily lives plays out in the courtroom,"" said Sarah Field, the group's new vice president for judicial strategy.But even more important than the money could be the firepower AFP wants to engage. The idea is to mobilize conservative activists across 36 states for key confirmation fights this year. That includes people who call their home-state senators, write letters and knock on doors.For now, ground zero is in Wisconsin, where AFP state director Eric Bott said it's a little too cold to knock on doors just yet. Bott said his network of 130,000 volunteers has rallied for Tea Party causes, supported Republican Gov. Scott Walker and fought for limits on the state's collective bargaining laws. Now, those volunteers are turning their attention to judges.""A lot of our activists are really looking for certain types of jurists,"" he said. ""They want a judge who's going to respect the rule of law. They're looking for a judge who's going to interpret the Constitution as it was originally intended.""AFP has already thrown its support behind one of President Trump's judge picks this year — Michael Brennan, a Milwaukee lawyer and ally of Gov. Walker.Wisconsin's Democratic senator, Tammy Baldwin, refused to turn in a blue slip for Brennan. The blue slip is a way for senators to signal support for a nominee. Withholding that paperwork usually means the end of a nomination, as Baldwin noted in a letter earlier this year.""President Trump's nomination of Mr. Brennan disregards the longstanding, bipartisan process in Wisconsin that has informed the selection of federal judges in my state,"" Baldwin said. ""This is a particularly troubling step at a time when institutions and traditions of democracy seem under constant attack, and bipartisanship feels like a fading concept.""But the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, broke with 100 years of tradition and held a hearing for Brennan anyway. Last month, Brennan advanced out of the committee on a party-line vote of 11 to 10. He's waiting for action by the full Senate.AFP is buying digital ads to encourage a quick vote.""This is a seat that has been vacant longer than any other seat on the federal bench and the people of Wisconsin deserve to see a judge confirmed on the 7th Circuit,"" said Sarah Field of AFP.Kristine Lucius of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights said that's not the full story. Lucius pointed out that the current nominee, Michael Brennan, wrote an opinion piece supporting Republican efforts to block President Obama's pick for that same job. The delay strategy worked.""And to think that that person who defended that right would now enjoy the nomination and be critical of the other senator who is exercising her own rights is the epitome of hypocrisy,"" she added.Lucius now fights against many of Trump's selections for the federal courts. But she said she understands why AFP is stepping up its role.""To me it's not surprising that the Koch brothers, billionaire corporate leaders, would want to invest their money in the fight to get judges to uphold their corporate rights,"" Lucius said. ""They think this is money well spent because they are trying to tilt the bench. They are trying not to have rule of law that rules against them, but instead they want to get more people into lifetime positions that will rule in favor of corporate interests over individual interests.""Judges confirmed to lifetime posts already represent one of the president's most important accomplishments. And groups on both ends of the political spectrum know that other big fights are on the way.From her headquarters in Virginia, Sarah Field of AFP says she's gearing up.""Everything that we're doing is really pointing to the future of the Supreme Court,"" Field said.Unlike some other conservative groups, AFP intends to make federal judges a focus of its permanent grass-roots efforts.Editor's note: Koch Industries, though not the Koch brothers' PAC, has been a sponsor of NPR."

Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., a glass-ceiling-shattering leader in Congress, died Friday at age 88, while serving her 16th term in the House of Representatives, her chief of staff said in a statement.She was surrounded by family at George Washington University Hospital at the time of her death, after sustaining an injury at her Washington, D.C., home last week.In an earlier statement, chief of staff Liam Fitzsimmons said Slaughter had fallen and was being treated for a concussion.House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called Slaughter a ""trailblazer,"" adding, ""It was my great privilege to serve with her and to benefit from her friendship and wise counsel for 30 years. Her loss will be deeply felt.""Slaughter's three decades in Congress saw her rise to become the first chairwoman of the powerful House Committee on Rules, a position she held from 2007-2011.At the time of her death, she remained ranking member.Pelosi said that Slaughter ""used her leadership position to fight for women and working families.""Among the legislation she co-authored was 1994's landmark Violence Against Women Act.She also worked to pass the Genetic Information and Non-Discrimination Act of 2008, which prevents employers and health insurers from penalizing people based on family health history or the results of genetic tests.  Slaughter had more than a passing interest in science; she was a microbiologist, the only one in Congress, according to her House biography. She was spurred to pursue the field after the childhood death of her sister from pneumonia.Slaughter received her Bachelor of Science degree in Microbiology and a Master of Science degree in Public Health from the University of Kentucky.She and her husband moved to Fairport, N.Y., after she completed graduate school, according to her spokesman's statement.Elected in 1986, Slaughter represented the 25th District of New York, an area that includes the city of Rochester, but her Southern origins continued to show.""Louise never forgot her roots as the daughter of a Kentucky blacksmith,"" Pelosi said. ""She brought the grace and grit of her Southern background to her leadership in the Congress, building bridges and breaking down barriers all with her beautiful accent.""Bipartisan tributes for Slaughter poured forth Friday.House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, R-Texas, said in a statement that while he and Slaughter may have been on opposite sides of the political divide, they nevertheless worked side by side for 20 years and he considered her a ""partner.""""As the first female Chairwoman of our Committee she was a force to be reckoned with who always brought her spunk, fire, and dynamic leadership to every meeting,"" Sessions wrote.Speaker of the House Paul Ryan called Slaughter's death ""jarring"" and ordered the flags above the Capitol to be flown at half-staff Friday.""She was unrelenting in fighting for her ideas and the people back home in Western New York,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""But really, the things that I keep coming back to is how she was tough, but unfailingly gracious.""Slaughter and her husband, Bob, were married for 57 years, until his death in 2014. They had three daughters, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.The Washington Post reports that Slaughter was the oldest sitting member of Congress, and yet she had been planning to seek re-election in November."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/15/594062887/some-russians-see-u-s-investigation-into-russian-election-meddling-as-a-soap-ope","The building at 55 Savushkina St. on the outskirts of St. Petersburg, Russia, is unremarkable. It's four stories high, made of concrete and shares a small parking lot with the apartment building next door.But if you look a little closer, a few details stick out. For instance, the building is covered in windows, but each one is blocked by heavy drapes. And there are security cameras all over the building.That's what you can see from the outside. But what went on inside this building in 2015 has attracted a lot of attention in both U.S. and Russian media. The company that operated inside 55 Savushkina was called the Internet Research Agency. But unofficially, and more commonly, it was known as the ""troll factory.""Hundreds worked here, and 13 people, including a man with ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, were recently named in an indictment connected to special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Russian oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has been sanctioned by the U.S. for providing support to the Russian Defense Ministry as it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, is alleged to be the man who funded the troll factory.Internet activist Lyudmila Savchuk spent two months working undercover at the troll factory in 2015, creating fake social media accounts and writing blog posts meant to sow divisions in the U.S. and turn Russians against Americans.Savchuk, a slight woman in her mid-30s, carries around a laptop with a campaign sticker for Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader in Russia who has been barred from running in the presidential election this weekend.She sips a latte in a cafe outside St. Petersburg after dropping her kids off at day care for the afternoon.""The factory worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There was a day shift, a night shift, and even shifts over the holidays. The factory worked every single second,"" Savchuk says.In the early days of her investigation into how fake social media accounts and trolls were affecting society, she was looking for a way in. It was late 2014 and she kept seeing advertisements in her social media feed geared to young, educated Russians looking to work in a creative field. A friend who worked at the troll factory tipped her off to what the ads were for. That same friend put in a good word for Savchuk with her bosses.""My friend taught me the ropes. She told me that I had to write posts that were natural — like, for example, 'I am cooking or I am walking down the street and I had this thought about how bad the [pro-Western] Ukrainian president is.' ""According to Savchuk, there were a few hundred people in the building at any given time, and the average pay started at $400 a month. The trolls were divided into groups. Those with the best English skills posed as Americans and created accounts on Facebook and Twitter. They'd use those troll accounts to stir up trouble on subjects such as U.S. elections or race relations.Savchuk, who considers herself a freelance investigative journalist and activist for free and fair elections, spent most of her time at the troll farm writing as an imaginary Russian woman on the LiveJournal blogging platform, widely used in Russia today. Her posts were meant for Russian readers and were intended to inflame anti-American feelings.""We made up a post about a new computer game created in the States — that even kids loved to play — and the theme of the game was slavery,"" she says. ""And this was to stir negative tensions towards Americans, as the creators of this game.""That game never existed. Nor did the woman that Savchuk was posing as. A day at the troll factory could mean multiple layers of trolling subterfuge.Each troll was given a list of topics to focus on by a supervisor. She says there were usually about 10 topics on the list. The United States, the European Union and Putin never left the list.""It is laughable when Putin says that we do not know about trolls or trolls do not exist,"" she says, ""because when anyone looks through the Kremlin-controlled newspapers or state TV, they can see that the propaganda in that media is the exact same stuff that the trolls are posting.""Savchuk worries about the deleterious effect of so much fake information on Russian society.""For the public, it is harmful because we are being brainwashed,"" she says. ""We won't be able to understand what is really happening. We are put against one another, and we are sliding back into the old ways when we were searching for the enemy among us — our friends and colleagues. That feeling from the Soviet times — I can feel it everywhere.""Savchuk eventually leaked documents, videos and her story to the independent Russian news outlet Moy Rayon in 2015. And then the trolls and state-controlled media came after her.""They said that I am a secret agent, a CIA operative, and that I am a pervert,"" she says. ""This is what they usually do. So I was ready for this.""She says she ignored the trolls and hoped that her reporting spoke for itself.She says that the charges against the 13 employees of the Internet Research Agency are her answer to those allegations.Savchuk says she worked with several of the 13 troll factory people named in the Mueller indictment and was elated when she heard that workers and managers at the factory had been indicted.""This was really a good sign,"" she says. ""We should continue to add more names to this list. I think that every single propagandist, even the little troll on Facebook, has to be punished, has to be named and exposed.""Freelance journalist Anna Shpakova contributed to this story."

But several senators have already expressed reservations because of Haspel's role in the CIA's waterboarding of al-Qaida suspects after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, posted this tweet Tuesday:Waterboarding and other harsh interrogation methods appear set for another round of litigation in the court of public opinion as the Senate prepares to vote on Haspel's nomination.In many ways, U.S. laws and policies are much clearer today than in the past and have effectively settled some legal questions.President Barack Obama banned torture with an executive order in 2009. The Republican-led Congress followed up with its own torture ban in a 2015 law. The Army Field Manual spells out which types of interrogation are permitted, and waterboarding is not among them.The likely debateStill, that doesn't mean the discussion is over. Not by a long shot.""The debate that will occur around the Haspel nomination may help clear the air by putting these issues before the public,"" said John Prados, a senior fellow at the National Security Archive, a nonprofit in Washington that advocates for government openness.However, if Haspel and the CIA are not forthcoming, it could create a new backlash, he warned.""I believe the agency is mistaken if it thinks it can escape from what happened here,"" added Prados, a frequent critic of the agency and the author of The Ghosts of Langley: Into The CIA's Heart Of Darkness.John Rizzo, who was the CIA's acting general counsel in the period after the Sept. 11 attacks, also believes a renewed discussion could be helpful.""Now, with the benefit of time, I think the country would be well-served by a reasoned, non-emotional discussion about whether any kind of interrogation technique, beyond a standard Q&A, is ever justifiable — or effective, for that matter,"" Rizzo told NPR's Morning Edition.However, Rizzo, who said he has known Haspel since the 1990s, remains a supporter of the tough interrogation methods.""I have some regrets, but I still continue to believe the program was effective,"" he said. ""I have a strong feeling that the information in question — and there was a lot of it — would not have come nearly as quickly without resorting to aggressive measures.""He does not think those measure amounted to torture.""I do not believe that the word 'torture' was and is legally accurate,"" he said. ""There were very harsh, very brutal methods. But not torture.""Trump's campaign commentsLegally speaking, an attempt to resume waterboarding or other similarly harsh techniques would require new legislation reversing the measures put in place in recent years, legal scholars say. In practical political terms, any technique that amounts to torture is certain to provoke a firestorm of criticism.Trump raised the issue during the 2016 presidential campaign, saying, ""I would bring back waterboarding, and I would bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.""During the first days of the Trump administration in January 2017, McCain said: ""The president can sign whatever executive orders he likes. But the law is the law. We are not bringing back torture in the United States of America.""In addition, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other current and former officials in the military and intelligence communities have spoken out against waterboarding.An undercover careerHaspel was an undercover CIA officer for three decades and therefore has no public record. Some Democratic senators objected when she was named the CIA's deputy director a year ago, but that position did not require Senate confirmation.In addition to overseeing a black site prison in 2002, she was deeply involved in the 2005 decision to destroy videotapes of the waterboarding sessions. That action came after Congress had learned of the videos and called on them to be preserved.The Justice Department spent years investigating alleged abuses in the interrogation program, but no one was ever charged with a crime. Haspel's supporters say that she and others involved were asked to do a tough job and were given assurances that their actions were legal.""People in the prosecution of their duties inside government take on a great burden,"" said Danielle Pletka of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""They do not deserve to be indicted on Twitter or by WikiLeaks or in the press before they get a hearing.""For a time, Haspel was at the black site prison in Thailand where some al-Qaida suspects were interrogated after the Sept. 11 attacks.One big question is whether evidence obtained during their interrogations will be admissible at a trial for the suspects.Greg Myre is a national security correspondent. Follow him @gregmyre1.Editor's note on March 16: In a previous version of this story, there was a reference to Gina Haspel's presence ""at a black site prison in Thailand"" where two al-Qaida suspects, Abu Zubaydah and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, were interrogated. According to several media reports, including from ProPublica, she was ""chief of base"" at that site starting in 2002. But this week, ProPublica issued a retraction, a correction and an apology for some of its reporting on that point. It now says that Haspel was not in charge of that black site at the time of Zubaydah's interrogations and had not mocked his complaints about the treatment."

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/17/former-cia-chief-brennan-attacks-trump-over-mccabe-firing.html","Former CIA Director John Brennan slammed President Trump on Saturday for firing Andrew McCabe days before being eligible for a lifetime pension, suggesting the president is a “demagogue” headed for the “dustbin of history.”McCabe, a former acting FBI director, was fired Friday night after multiple federal probes and reports showed that he lied to investigators reviewing the bureau’s probe into whether Hillary Clinton sent and received classified information on private email servers while secretary of state.He was fired days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pension.The attorney general said the reports concluded that McCabe made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor -- including under oath -- on multiple occasions. Sessions also said McCabe was fired after a “fair and extensive” investigation.“Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy,” Trump tweeted Friday night. “Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!”Republicans on the GOP-controlled committee ealier this month made that conclusion, though Democrats on the panel disagree.Trump has been feuding with FBI leadership since taking office, suggesting top bureau officials are undermining him and his administration – particularly with its investigation into whether his 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” Brennan, an Obama administration CIA director, tweeted in response to Trump’s tweet. “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”McCabe, who served as the FBI’s acting director after Trump fired James Comey in May 2017, said his dismissal is “part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement and intelligence professionals more generally.”""It is part of this Administration’s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel (Russia collusion) investigation,” he said in a statement. “For the last year and a half, my family and I have been the targets of an unrelenting assault on our reputation and my service to this country.He continued: “The President’s tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all. He called for my firing. He called for me to be stripped of my pension after more than 20 years of service.""McCabe led the bureau, independently, until Aug. 2, 2017 -- during the early months of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates.Republicans have long criticized McCabe for his ties to the Democratic Party — his wife received donations during a failed 2015 Virginia Senate run from a group tied to a Clinton ally, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe — all while the Clinton email probe was underway.McCabe returned to the spotlight when Republicans on the House Intelligence committee released its memo on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act abuses in connection with the Russia probe, saying that McCabe signed a FISA warrant targeting former Trump campaign volunteer adviser Carter Page.Fox News’ Brooke Singman contributed to this report."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/17/trumps-lawyer-calls-for-manufactured-russia-probe-to-be-shut-down.html","President Trump’s personal attorney John Dowd called on Saturday for Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to shut down FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe -- coming just hours after ex-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was fired.“I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,” he said in a statement to Fox News. “Just end it on the merits in light of recent revelations,” he added.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, said the remarks showed that Trump's team is looking ""not to cooperate with Special Counsel Mueller, but to undermine him at every turn.""""The president, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel's investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans,"" Schumer said in a statement.""It also seems important that the timing coincides with McCabe’s firing, so we can probably expect that there will be increasing pressure on [Rosenstein] to end the Mueller inquiry, although McCabe’s actions were only tangentially related to Mueller’s work,"" he said.Sessions fired McCabe late Friday after a yet-unpublished IG report found that he made an unauthorized leak to the media and then ""lacked candor"" when speaking about its investigators. McCabe was fired just days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pensionSessions’ decision to fire McCabe came as Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz concluded a bureau oversight investigation, with a report expected to be critical of McCabe’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe, his handling of the bureau during the early months of the Russia investigation, and his ties to the Democratic Party.Horowitz determined that McCabe hadn't been forthcoming regarding the handling of the FBI’s probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state in the Obama administration.The inspector general’s finding triggered an FBI disciplinary process that recommended McCabe’s firing. Sources told Fox News that the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility made the recommendation to fire McCabe. Sessions had the option to either accept the recommendation, or step in to stop the firing process.Trump hailed the firing as a ""great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI"" in a tweet early Saturday.McCabe hit back at the move in a statement Friday, calling his firing part of an ""ongoing war at the FBI.""""This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally,"" McCabe said. ""It is part of this Administration’s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel’s work.""Fox News' Brooke Singman, Jake Gibson and Jason Donner contributed to this report."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/17/some-democrats-want-pelosi-out-now-win-or-lose-house-in-midterms.html","Some House Democrats wanted Nancy Pelosi out as their leader after they failed to win a string of 2017 special elections. And now some want the House minority leader out because they appear to have won a special election.What gives with the paradox? It doesn’t make sense, except that some House Democrats are prepared to move on from Pelosi -- and some aren’t.“The watch” is on again on Capitol Hill when it comes to Pelosi, how has been the House’s top Democrat for more than a decade.  Lamb distanced himself from Pelosi and ran as a moderate Democrat. And now Democrats are eager to replicate Lamb’s prototype in their quest to capture the House in November.Republicans contend Pelosi is radioactive, considering how critics have branded her as a West Coast liberal losing touch with the party base.  And the plan to use the leader to put other moderate Democratic candidates on the spot this year. In other words, will you support Pelosi for House speaker should Democrats win the House? And it’s moderate to conservative Democrats who must win -- in districts Trump carried -- if Democrats are going to have a shot at winning the House.They never got close. Some Democrats tore into Pelosi. She drew a challenge for her leadership post from Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio. Pelosi prevailed in the end, but an eye-popping 63 Democrats cast ballots for Ryan.Ohio Rep. John Boehner in 2015 was forced out as House speaker, the chamber’s leader and top Republican, is a similar intra-caucus revolt.Pelosi’s weathered the internecine tempest so far. But for how long?Many political prognosticators suggest a Democratic wave is building this fall. If that’s the case, Democrats will swipe seats from Republicans in rural areas in the Midwest and perhaps the south where Pelosi isn’t popular. Could Democrats follow Lamb’s lead and disavow Pelosi?That could be a sound electoral tactic. But it could cause a problem for Pelosi in her quest to return to the speaker’s suite.The question is whether Pelosi could command the votes to again become Speaker.This could be one of the great political incongruities of all time: Democrats win the House and simultaneously deny Pelosi the right to again clasp the speaker’s gavel. There’s a reason why Democrats were willing to re-elect Pelosi as minority leader for two years, despite 63 defections: give her another shot to lead Democrats out of the wilderness.It may seem strange to potentially have Pelosi return to the Speakership after an eight-year exodus in the minority. But it’s far from unprecedented for house speakers to have broken service. The first, Frederick Muhlenberg, of Pennsylvania, served as speaker in two different Congresses, interrupted by Speaker Jonathan Trumbull of Connecticut. Same with Henry Clay, of Kentucky, who enjoyed three different turns at speaker.Speaker Thomas Reed, R-Maine, led the House in the 51st Congress, then  again in the 54th and 55th congresses. The best examples of lawmakers returning to the speakership after exile in the minority are Speakers Sam Rayburn, D-Texas, and Joseph Martin, R-Mass. Rayburn became speaker in September 1940. Martin took the reins in 1947. Rayburn came back in 1949. Martin and the Republicans rallied in 1953. Finally, Rayburn began his last tour as speaker in 1955.Pelosi keeps close counsel on her future plans. Her confidantes point out it’s against her DNA to bow to pressure or not go without a fight. By the same token, Pelosi is an exceptional vote counter. She knows how to gauge her caucus and if she has the votes to prevail, accurately predicting she’d get two-thirds of the vote in the Ryan challenge. If Pelosi doesn’t, she will likely exit.It will boil down to simple mathematics.Chatter is percolating throughout the Capitol that Pelosi may attempt a cunning departure in an attempt to bolster Democrats in their quest for the House and simultaneously hose Republicans.House Republican leaders continued making their case this week that votes for Democratic candidates could again elevate Pelosi to speaker. There’s a theory (and it’s just a theory) that Pelosi could time an exit later this year -- just after Republicans spend millions producing commercials and buying airtime that attempt to link Democratic candidates to her.Such a scenario could leave Republicans on the hook with lots of outdated ad buys. They will have squandered millions of dollars making a case against someone who is no longer a factor. Some Republicans may publicly rejoice that that they finally dispatched Pelosi. But sober GOPers know Pelosi taking her leave is bad news for them. It robs Republicans of a foil -- especially if the party is trying to link Democrats to Pelosi.But these scenarios are just that: scenarios. And few believe Pelosi would bow out early.Republicans successfully deployed Pelosi against Democrats when they won the House in 2010. Pelosi is certainly radioactive in certain districts. But it’s unclear if the Pelosi maneuver still works.“This is part of the bankruptcy of the Republican Party,” Pelosi said. “They’re devoid of ideas about how they’re going to meet the needs of the American people. So it’s an ad hominem. They can’t win on the issues. So they go after a person.”House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley says of the Pelosi attacks: “I think they need to get a new game book. The attempts to use Nancy Pelosi, it’s failing them at this point. And I think, quite frankly, it’s sexist.”Some quarters on Capitol Hill view Crowley as best situated to succeed Pelosi. Another possibility is her longtime rival, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat.Ryan repeatedly says he won’t challenge Pelosi again. But he says she must go and that there’s merit in Lamb’s approach.“Every candidate’s locally got to make that determination as to how in their own heart, how they feel about Democratic leadership in Washington, D.C., fits into their own agenda and their own election and how their people feel locally,” Ryan said.Did Lamb’s distance from Pelosi make a difference in the race?“I don’t think that your opponent should choose your party’s leaders,” said Pelosi, who’s represented San Francisco since 1986. “They’re coming after me because of my city. And they’re against LGBT and they’re against poor children. That’s been my mantra. The poor children of America, I’m here to support. Yes. I am a liberal.”It’s those “liberal” credentials that work against Pelosi, even inside her party. Can conservative Democrats support liberal for Speaker again?Unclear.Lamb’s possible win may portend good things for Democrats in November. But they likely need to win about 25 seats to retake the House. The precise number is unclear because there are a number of vacancies. The Lamb-Saccone race still isn’t official, and the district will be redrawn for November. And the death this week of Rep. Louise Slaughter, D.N.Y., has now put that seat in play. So, it’s unknown if Democrats will win the House and face a dilemma over who to elect as speaker.But Pelosi watch is on again on Capitol Hill.    "

Thad Cochran, the first Republican in more than 100 years to win a statewide election in his home state of Mississipi, is the latest lawmaker to announce he will not seek re-election.""It has been a great honor to serve the people of Mississippi and our country,"" Cochran said in a statement Monday. ""I've done my best to make decisions in the best interests of our nation, and my beloved state.""Cochran said his resignation will be effective April 1. He's joining a long list of Congress members who have already announced plans to depart their posts.Here’s the list of Republicans, in the House and Senate, who have announced they will not seek re-election:Barton’s announcement came after pressure for him to end his re-election bid mounted. Barton, 68, apologized after a nude photo of him surfaced on social media. He said he engaged in consensual sexual relationships while he was estranged from his second wife.""I’ve always listened to people in Texas and worked for them in Washington, and I’ve been listening to a lot of people the last week in Texas,"" Barton told the Dallas Morning News in November. ""There are enough people who lost faith in me that it’s time to step aside and let there be a new voice ... so I am not going to run for re-election.""“My life has undergone some big changes over the last 18 months. Those changes have been good. But as I celebrated my 50th birthday in March, the reality of spending more than 1,500 nights away from my family over eight years hit me harder than it had before,” Chaffetz said at the time.He later signed with Fox News as a contributor. John Curtis, a Republican, won a special election in November to replace him.""I regret my health has become an ongoing challenge,"" Cochran said in an online statement. ""I intend to fulfull my responsiblities and commitments to the people of Mississippi and the Senate through the completion of the 2018 appropriations cycle.""The 80-year-old stayed home for a month last fall with urinary tract infections. He returned to Washington in October, giving Republicans the majority they needed to pass a budget plan.Cochran has been serving in the Senate since 1978. He's the tenth longest-serving senator in U.S. history, according to the statement.Republican Gov. Phil Bryant will appoint a temporary replacement. Then a special election will be held to fill the rest of the term, through January 2021.Corker, 65, had previously said that he “couldn’t imagine” serving more than two terms. Corker has often feuded with President Trump.Dent, 57, has been openly critical of Trump. He voted against party lines and a repeal of ObamaCare last year.In announcing his retirement, Duncan, 70, thanked conservatives who supported him against “recent attacks against me from the far left.”“I have decided I wanted to spend less time in airports, airplanes and traveling around the district and more time with my family, especially my nine grandchildren, who all live in Knoxville,” Duncan said. “I love my job, but I love my family more.”Roll Call reported that Duncan’s sister, state Sen. Becky Duncan Massey, could launch a bid for his empty seat.The House Ethics Committee said earlier in December 2017 that it was expanding a probe into sexual harassment allegations against the lawmaker, which would include an investigation into whether he retaliated against a former staff member for complaining of such behavior. Congressional sources said Farenthold paid an $84,000 settlement using taxpayer money.In a video posted to his campaign Facebook page, Farenthold said he “allowed a workplace culture to take root in my office that was too permissive and decidedly unprofessional.” However, he continued to deny the sexual harassment claims against him.“An unprofessional work environment is not a crime, but it’s embarrassing to me and to my family. It reflects poorly on the institution of Congress, on my colleagues and on my constituents, and they deserve better,” he said.House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told reporters Farenthold was “making the right decision to retire,” citing the “unacceptable behavior that has been alleged.”  But Texas Democratic Party Executive Director Crystal K. Perkins slammed Farenthold’s decision not to run for re-election as “simply not enough,” calling it a “PR stunt.” Flake, 55, faced a tough re-election campaign in Arizona against Kelli Ward, a physician who has also challenged Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Trump has previously said that it was “great” that Ward was running against a “toxic” Flake.In announcing that he wouldn’t run for re-election, Flake said the GOP is becoming a “backward-looking minority party.”“It is clear in this moment that a traditional conservative, who believes in limited government and free markets, who is devoted to free-trade, who is pro-immigration, has a narrower and narrower path to nomination in the Republican Party, the party that has for so long defined itself by its belief in those things,” Flake said. He attributed the change in date to his wife's admittance to the hospital but reports later surfaced alleging Frank repeatedly pressed a former aide to carry his child, offering her $5 million to act as a surrogate.Franks’ announcement came as the House Ethics Committee said it was looking into whether he “engaged in conduct that constitutes sexual harassment and/or retaliation for opposing sexual harassment.”Franks, 60, maintained that he never physically intimidated, coerced or had sexual contact with any member of his staff. He said he discussed surrogacy issues with some of his female staff which made them “uncomfortable.”The conservative congressman said that “in the midst of this current cultural and media climate, I am deeply convinced I would be unable to complete a fair House Ethics investigation before distorted and sensationalized versions of this story would put me, my family, my staff and noble colleagues in the House of Representatives through hyperbolized public excoriation.”The New Jersey Republican, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, was facing his first competitive re-election race in decades. Frelinghuysen, 71, was first elected in the 1994 GOP wave that put Republicans in control of both chambers. He hails from a New Jersey political dynasty that dates to the late 1700s. His father, Peter, served in the House for two decades.The Virginia lawmaker, who has been in Congress since 1993, said he has discussed whether to run for re-election with his wife, Maryellen, every two years. This year’s conversation, Goodlatte said, was different.“With my time as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee ending in December 2018, this is a natural stepping-off point and an opportunity to begin a new chapter of my career and spend more time with my family, particularly my granddaughters,” Goodlatte, 65, said in a letter. The South Carolina Republican, who until recently also sat on the House Ethics Committee, said he would be “returning to the justice system.”“Whatever skills I may have are better utilized in a courtroom than in Congress, and I enjoy our justice system more than our political system,” the 53-year-old said. “As I look back on my career, it is the jobs that both seek and reward fairness that are most rewarding.”Gowdy also oversaw the divisive House investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack.Harper, 61, was first elected in 2008. He said “10 years will be long enough” for him to have served in Congress.Harper was an ardent supporter of anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training in the U.S. House. His committee held a hearing in November 2017 regarding sexual misconduct involving current House members.After the hearing, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that the House would begin to require anti-harassment and anti-discrimination trainings for members and their staff. The 83-year-old said Trump told him during a recent visit to Utah that he was a “fighter.”“But every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves. And for me, that time is soon approaching,” Hatch said in a video message posted on social media.“I’ve authored more bills that have become law than any member of Congress alive today,” Hatch also said, adding that one of his “proudest legislative achievements” was his work with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which ensures religious freedoms are protected.""Today I am announcing that I will not seek re-election to the US Congress in 2018. Although service in Congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned,"" Hensarling, 60, said, according to the Dallas Morning News.Hensarling also added that he wants to spend more time with his family.  Issa, 64, only barely won re-election in 2016. He beat his Democratic challenger, Douglas Applegate, by less than one percentage point for California’s 49th congressional district.This seat was seen as a toss-up that could potentially go to a Democrat in 2018, even prior to Issa’s impending retirement.  “Representing you has been the privilege of a lifetime,” Issa, who has been in Congress since 2001, said in a statement.But Issa could come eventually return to Congress. He is reportedly considering running for Rep. Duncan Hunter’s seat, should the Republican decide to retire as well.Jenkins, 54, said she wanted to return to the private sector although she was highly rumored to be a possible gubernatorial candidate in Kansas.“For me, the Lord has made clear that the season of my life in Congress is coming to an end,” Johnson, 87, said.Johnson is an Air Force veteran who was a prisoner of war at the infamous Hanoi Hilton in Vietnam.LoBiondo’s retirement opens up a seat in a potential swing district. Trump won it in 2016, but former President Barack Obama took the district in 2012.The GOP lawmaker has differed from his party on certain issues. He voted against the budget framework and has expressed concerns about Republicans’ tax plan, specifically the move to eliminate certain state and local deductions. ""After consultation with my wife Carolyn and with my three sons, and after prayerful reflection, I write to inform you that I will not seek re-election to the United States Congress for the 7th Congressional District in 2018,"" Meehan wrote, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer.The decision, the 62-year-old reportedly said, was made following reports that he allegedly used taxpayer money to fund a settlement to a former aide who claimed he sexually harassed her. Meehan called the revelations ""a major distraction"" and said he needed ""to own it because it is my own conduct that fueled the matter.""On Jan. 23, 2018, Meehan acknowledged telling a longtime former aide that he considered her a ""soul mate"" and admitted acting ""selfishly"" after learning that she was dating someone else. The former aide filed a sexual misconduct complaint against the lawmaker last summer and he allegedly used taxpayer money in the settlement.Murphy, 65, said he will “take personal time to seek help as my family and I continue to work through our personal difficulties.” “I am grateful for the honor and privilege to represent the best people in America, Texas’s Second Congressional District. Thanks to the good Lord, I’m in good health, but it’s time for the next step,” Poe, 69, said on Nov. 7, 2017.He added that he’s planning to spend more time with his grandchildren. All 12 of them were born since he’s been in Congress, Poe said. He assumed office in 2005. Reichert said the decision to retire from Congress was “the right one for my family and me.”Rooney, 47, said in a statement that “it’s time to ‘hang em up’"" and thanked his constituents for ""allowing [him] the opportunity to serve them in Washington."" “I look forward to serving Florida again in the future in a different capacity. Keep the faith. Slainte!” the congressman said.According to the Tampa Bay Times, Rooney’s decision was not too surprising, given his frustration with Washington. The publication also said Rooney was “deeply affected” by the shooting at a practice for the Congressional Baseball Game in June 2017.“The most difficult challenge is not to simply keep winning elections; but rather the more difficult challenge is to not let the ability to win define my seasons,” she said.Born in Havana, Cuba, Ros-Lehtinen is considered a moderate Republican who was not a strong supporter of Trump.Royce, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said that he wanted to completely focus his final year as committee chairman on the ""urgent threats facing our nation.""Royce, 66, is serving out his 13th term.In an announcement detailing his decision to not seek re-election, Royce cited the tax cut bill passed in December and the crackdown on the global ivory trade as some of his accomplishments.The Pennsylvania Republican announced on Jan. 2, 2017 that he would not seek re-election in November. He told the publication that as he would not be coming back to Washington as a congressman, he could better work with parties on both sides of the aisle during his remaining time in office. Smith, who chairs the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, has served in the House of Representatives since 1987.But Strange, 64, lost in the special primary election earlier in 2017 to Roy Moore. Moore became the GOP nominee for the Senate and eventually lost to Democrat Doug Jones. In his farewell speech to the Senate in December, Strange encouraged his fellow lawmakers to remain committed to bipartisanship.“To lose the art of balance and compromise in this body is to lose something essentially American,” he said.Serving as a Republican congressman for 17 years, Tiberi's final day in Congress was Jan. 15, 2018.Trott, 57, will retire at the end of his second term. His district is Republican-leaning, but analysts told the Detroit News that a Democrat could flip the seat.“Most people in politics say the right things, but they never fight for the right things,” Black said in a video announcing her candidacy. “They're too meek or maybe even too weak ... I don't back down.”Black, 67, was the first female chair of the powerful House Budget Committee, and she was in that position during the nation’s tax overhaul. She resigned as chairwoman last year to focus on her gubernatorial race.Ron DeSantisA former Navy lawyer, DeSantis, 39, is an ardent support of Trump and was praised by the president on social media last year.“Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida. He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!” Trump tweeted a month before DeSantis made his official announcement.Raul LabradorLabrador, 50, is a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus.Kristi NoemNoem, 46, officially kicked off her gubernatorial bid last year.Steve PearcePearce, 70, has been a congressman for more than 12 years.

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/17/propublica-s-massive-screw-up-catches-many-outlets-and-other-media-humiliations.html","Toss a pebble in a pond and you get ripples. Toss an inaccurate story into today’s news environment and you cause a tidal wave of inaccurate news. That’s exactly what left-wing ProPublica did last year in a story about CIA torture. The result of that screw-up has swamped numerous major news outlets.The February 2017 story was a hit job on CIA Deputy Director Gina Haspel. It involved the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah, who the CIA says was an Al Qaeda leader. The ProPublica story said Haspel had overseen his waterboarding “and other coercive interrogation methods that are widely seen as torture.” She allegedly “mocked the prisoner’s suffering,” demonizing her even further.Except it didn’t happen. “Neither of these assertions is correct and we retract them,” ProPublica wrote in a correction published Thursday – more than a year after the original incorrect story was published and, coincidentally, on the Ides of March.Thanks for the understatement.It’s not hard to find media outlets that didn’t just embrace the ProPublica story, they cited it. Rolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi ran this: “Taibbi: Trump's CIA Pick Took Part in Silencing Torture Suspect.” It cited ProPublica reporter Raymond Bonner at the top of the story. NPR’s “All Things Considered” had Bonner on to discuss his article.ProPublica’s mea culpa did blame The New York Times, too. It noted that the Times “also reported last year that Haspel oversaw the interrogation of Abu Zubaydah and another detainee.”There will be a ton of recriminations and corrections. MSNBC Anchor Chris Hayes put it mildly: “That's a very big error.”Daily Mail U.S. Political Editor David Martosko got to the heart of the problem with his comment. “Wow. This error launched hundreds of articles. It is not a small mistake,” he tweeted.ProPublica was founded with $10 million a year from liberal billionaires Herbert and Marion Sandler. Slate’s Jack Shafer, who now writes for Politico, wrote in 2007 how the couple had funded everything from Democratic politicians to the Center for American Progress and Moveon.org. Left, lefter and leftist. An outlet that does hit jobs seems to be exactly what the Sandlers wanted.ProPublica is still the darling of the major media. CNN Senior Media Correspondent Brian Stelter called ProPublica “one of the country's most respected news organizations” in the Reliable Sources newsletter. (He meant by fellow newsies. Most Americans have never heard of it until this week.)ProPublica has received four Pulitzer Prizes and numerous other awards. Its 46 separate 2017 media partners included The New York Times, USA Today and NPR.Ironically, ProPublica Illinois just posted a story Tuesday about its commitment to “Keep Bias Out of Stories.” It included this nugget: “We stick with the facts, and several editors read every story.”2. Journalists Play Chiefs of Staff: The Haspel appointment wasn’t the only one the media fixated on this week. President Trump was making more moves in his Cabinet and journalists had two consistent views – the people he adds are bad and people he fires are good.New Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo was called a “Benghazi bomb-thrower” by Washington Post Reporter Erica Werner. The “Democracy Dies in Darkness” staffer then deleted her tweet. So much for transparency.CNN Political Director David Chalian looked down his nose at Kudlow, calling him “a cable TV personality.” One wonders if Chalian remembers where he works.Over at MSNBC, they were baffled by Kudlow’s religious faith and his comment that “however things work out, it will be God’s will.” Co-Anchor Stephanie Ruhle acted stunned. “That’s an interesting way to talk about being the national economic adviser to the president. God’s will?”Seriously, do media people never encounter anyone with religious faith or are they just reflexively anti-faith?Then there was the “60 Minutes” attack on Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. It referred to her as “the most hated member of the Trump Cabinet” and reminded viewers twice that she’s a “devout Christian.” Scary.But when it looks like President Trump is firing someone the media like, it all goes bad. MSNBC Anchor Nicolle Wallace asked if the president is “a bleep-hole” for considering firing former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe (who was later fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions).Or there’s Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, also canned this week. When he was chosen, the New York Times wrote: “Rex Tillerson, an Aggressive Dealmaker Whose Ties With Russia May Prompt Scrutiny.” Now that he’s out, we get a column: “In Faint Praise of Rex Tillerson.” Columnist Thomas Friedman tweeted: “Rex Tillerson: The worst Secretary of State ever – and I am really going to miss him.” "
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/17/andrew-mccabe-controversies-from-trump-text-scandal-to-his-wifes-failed-campaign.html","Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on March 16. McCabe was fired just days before he was slated to retire from the bureau, meaning he may not be able to collect his full pension benefits upon his departure. FBI disciplinary officials reportedly recommended McCabe's firing. His departure comes ahead of a yet-to-be-released inspector general investigation that's allegedly critical of his handling of the Hillary Clinton e-mail probe, the Associated Press reported. Republicans have long voiced conflict-of-interest complaints over McCabe's ties to the Democratic Party, including his wife's having received donations for a failed 2015 Senate run from a group tied to former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Here's what you need to know about McCabe's FBI career and the controversies that have followed. In July 2015, a press release announced that then-FBI Director James Comey had appointed McCabe associate deputy director. Comey named McCabe the bureau’s deputy director in January 2016.“Andy’s 19 years of experience, combined with his vision, judgment and ability to communicate, make him a perfect fit for this job,” Comey said in a statement at the time.After President Donald Trump fired Comey, McCabe was acting director of the FBI from May 9, 2017, until Aug. 2, 2017. Trump’s pick to replace Comey, Christopher Wray, was sworn in the same day.WHO IS FBI DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY?Though Trump has called McCabe biased, the story in question suggested that FBI officials wanted to more actively probe the Clinton Foundation but were discouraged from more aggressive steps by the Obama Justice Department.However, a source told The Associated Press that McCabe is suspected of having not been forthcoming with officials from the inspector general's office who were investigating the media leak — an allegation he has denied. In January, The Journal reported that McCabe knew of thousands of emails related to the Clinton investigation for at least a month before Comey told Congress about them. The day he was fired, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that ""the FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability."" In response, McCabe said that his firing was a part of the Trump administration's ""war on the FBI,"" adding that he was being singled out because of the ""role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey.""An Aug. 15, 2016, text message Strzok sent to FBI lawyer Lisa Page apparently references an “insurance policy” against Trump winning the 2016 election.“I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office - that there’s no way he gets elected - but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk,” Strzok said in the text message. “It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you’re 40.”The “Andy” mentioned in the text was possibly a reference to McCabe.McCabe “played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind,” the FBI told The Journal in a statement. “Months after the completion of her campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton’s emails.”Trump has been critical of the donations. Dr. McCabe later lost the race to her Republican opponent, incumbent Dick Black. Fox News’  Jake Gibson, Barnini Chakraborty Madeline Farber, Lukas Mikelionis  and The Associated Press also contributed to this report. "
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/17/trump-calls-fired-mccabe-choirboy-suggests-fbi-corruption-at-highest-levels.html","President Trump called Andrew McCabe a 'choirboy' as he lauded the former acting FBI Director's firing, suggesting multiple federal reports show “corruption at the highest level.”“Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!” Trump tweeted hours after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the dismissal.McCabe was fired just days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pension after it was determined that he lied to investigators reviewing the bureau’s probe of Hillary Clinton’s email server.He went to say that after reviewing the reports, it was “McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions.”""This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally,"" McCabe said. ""It is part of this Administration’s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel’s work.”""Articles too numerous to count have leveled every sort of false, defamatory and degrading allegation against us,” he said. “The President’s tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all. He called for my firing. He called for me to be stripped of my pension after more than 20 years of service. And all along we have said nothing, never wanting to distract from the mission of the FBI by addressing the lies told and repeated about us. No more.""McCabe's firing marked a stunning fall for a man who was No. 2 at the bureau for a time under former FBI Director James Comey, ran it and even was reportedly on Trump’s short list for the directorship.But McCabe has also been mired in controversy in recent years.Horowitz determined that McCabe hadn't been forthcoming in regard to the handling of the FBI’s probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state in the Obama administration.The inspector general’s finding sparked an FBI disciplinary process that recommended McCabe’s firing.Horowitz’s investigation, which landed McCabe in hot water, faults the former deputy director for the way he answered questions about his approval for interactions between an FBI official and a reporter about the bureau’s investigation into the nonprofit Clinton Foundation.McCabe was “removed” from his post as deputy to FBI Director Christopher Wray in January, setting in motion a plan to leave the bureau after months of conflict-of-interest complaints from Republicans — including President Trump.""That's a determination we [left] up to Attorney General Sessions, but we do think that it is well documented that he has had some very troubling behavior and has been a bad actor,"" Sanders said.“FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!” Trump tweeted in December, before McCabe’s removal.McCabe became acting director of the FBI after Trump fired Comey on May 9, 2017. McCabe led the bureau, independently, until Aug. 2, 2017 — during the early months of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with Trump campaign associates.Republicans have also long criticized McCabe for his ties to the Democratic Party — his wife received donations during a failed 2015 Virginia Senate run from a group tied to a Clinton ally, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe — all while the Clinton email probe was underway.“How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin’ James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife’s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?” the president tweeted in December.McCabe returned to the white-hot spotlight when Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee released its memo on Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) abuses in connection with the Russia probe, saying that McCabe signed a FISA warrant targeting former Trump campaign volunteer adviser Carter Page.“McCabe testified before the committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the [FISA court] without the Steele dossier information,” the memo read. The Steele dossier was unverified, and financed as opposition research by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.And recently uncovered text messages between FBI officials Peter Strzok and Lisa Page revealed a new timeline in the Clinton email probe, apparently showing McCabe’s knowledge of the investigation.The text messages suggest that as of Sept. 28, 2016, Strzok, Page and McCabe were aware of new Clinton emails found on the laptop of disgraced former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, spouse of Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin. “Got called up to Andy’s earlier … hundreds of thousands of emails turned over by Weiner’s atty to sdny, includes a ton of material from spouse. Sending team up tomorrow to review…this will never end …” Strzok wrote in a text message to Page.But it wasn’t until Oct. 27, 2016 that Comey was briefed on the newly discovered emails — meaning McCabe kept the director in the dark for a month.Horowitz is specifically investigating McCabe and whether he wanted to avoid taking action on the laptop findings until after the presidential election, in which Clinton lost to Trump.According to testimony obtained by Fox News from an Office of Special Counsel interview with former Comey Chief of Staff James Rybicki, McCabe’s office did not notify him until the night of Oct. 26, 2016.The OSC also interviewed FBI Deputy General Counsel Trisha Anderson, who testified that Comey was first briefed on the material found on Weiner’s laptop on Oct. 27, 2016.Anderson noted that the director’s office decided to “urgently” address the situation.“Given the significance of the matter, um, uh, that we had to proceed quickly,” Anderson told investigators. “It was just too, too explosive for us to sit on.”So it wasn’t until Oct. 28, 2016, that Comey sent a letter to Congress announcing the “recent developments” of the discovery of the Clinton and Abedin communications found on the laptop —which he had just been briefed on a day before. That letter reopened the Clinton email probe just a week before the election. The inspector general is investigating McCabe’s involvement in this timeline.Several Republicans also have pointed with alarm to the Strzok-Page texts and their references to McCabe in relation to an “insurance policy” to prevent Trump from being elected president, and a “secret society” within the bureau."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/17/former-trump-administration-officials-from-comey-to-tillerson.html","A growing number of people have left the Trump administration in just over a year – a group that includes FBI director James Comey, chief strategist Steve Bannon and most recently FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe. Some, such as Comey, were fired by President Trump, while others resigned for a variety of reasons.Trump addressed the high turnover in the White House in a March 6 tweet, denying that there is any ""chaos."" ""People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection),"" he said. Read on for a look at some of the staffers who have left since Trump took office.McCabe, who was fired just two days before he was slated to retire, said that his firing is a part of the Trump administration's ""war on the FBI."" He also said he was removed because of the ""role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey."" Since McCabe was fired before his formal retirement date, it may impact his ability to collect his full pension benefits upon his departure. The dismissal was made on the recommendation of FBI disciplinary officials. A yet-to-be-released inspector general report allegedly concludes that McCabe had authorized the release of information to the news media and had not been forthcoming with the watchdog office as it examined the bureau's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.""The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability,"" Sessions said in a statement after McCabe was fired. The news comes after McCabe, a 20 year veteran of the FBI, was ""removed"" from his position as the No. 2 figure at the FBI and went on ""terminal leave"" in January, a source told Fox News at the time. He had repeatedly been criticized by Trump since 2016 when it was revealed that his wife, Dr. Jill McCabe, had accepted campaign contributions from the political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton ally, during a failed state Senate run.Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil chief, served as the nation’s top diplomat since February 2017. Rumors of his departure had circulated for months, especially after he reportedly called Trump a “moron” in front of other Cabinet officials in July 2017.In a tweet, Trump thanked Tillerson for his service to the country. A senior White House official told Fox News that Trump made the decision to replace Tillerson ahead of a planned meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.Tillerson later told reporters that he is delegating his responsibilities to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan until his final day at the end of March.He was moved to Trump's 2020 campaign, where he will serve as a senior adviser for campaign operations, the Trump campaign said.""Gary has been my chief economic advisor and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again,"" Trump said in a statement. ""He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.”Cohn, who served as Trump’s chief economic adviser since the beginning of the administration, has reportedly been discussing with the president his transition out of the White House for several weeks. Cohn opposed Trump's planned tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum and tried to get the president to change course.White House officials told Fox News that Cohn's departure date is to be determined, but it's expected to be in a few weeks.Cohn drafted a resignation letter last year, following the president's response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va. Her resignation, which she said would take effect on May 5, comes amid strained relations between the two countries. She did not specify why she will be leaving her post but said on Twitter that she is “in search of other opportunities.”""I have come to the difficult decision that it is the right time to move on to new challenges and adventures,"" Jacobson wrote in her note. ""This decision is all the more difficult because of my profound belief in the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship and knowledge that it is at a crucial moment.""A career diplomat, Jacobson previously served as assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs and is seen as having a deep understanding of the region and the Mexico-U.S. relationship. She said she has spent more than 31 years in government service.Hicks, 29, is Trump’s longest serving aide, as she previously worked for him and his family before he announced his candidacy.“Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years,” Trump said in a statement.“There are no words to adequately express my gratitude to President Trump,” Hicks, a former Ralph Lauren fashion model, said in a statement. “I wish the president and his administration the very best as he continues to lead our country.”The announcement came a day after Hicks acknowledged to a House intelligence panel that she has occasionally told ""white lies"" for Trump but denied lying about anything relevant to the Russia investigation. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Hicks' decision to leave the administration was “something that she’s been thinking about for a while.”Hicks, who largely worked behind the scenes during her tenure with Trump, found herself in the spotlight earlier this year when her relationship with former White House staff secretary Rob Porter was revealed. Porter left his job earlier in February after allegations surfaced that he physically abused his two ex-wives.Raffel joined the administration in the spring of 2017. He was hired to work on communications for the White House Office of American Innovation and also worked on behalf of Kushner and Trump. His portfolio of issues included tax reform and the Middle East peace process.In a statement, Ivanka Trump called Raffel ""honest, passionate and thoughtful,"" adding that his ""guidance was invaluable.""Raffel is expected to return to New York to join the private sector and tend to family obligations, Axios reported.Sorensen's ex-wife first told The Washington Post that he was violent and emotionally abusive during their marriage. He has denied the allegations. Sorensen's position did not require a security clearance, the White House said, adding that his background check was ongoing.Sorensen had worked as a senior adviser to Gov. Paul LePage, according to the Portland Press Herald. Brand, the No. 3 official in the Justice Department, served in the role for nine months before accepting a job with Walmart. She will serve as the retail giant's executive vice president, global governance and corporate secretary.In an interview with Fox News, Brand disputed claims that she left the administration due to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign.Porter’s ex-wives told the Daily Mail that he was physically and mentally abusive.Porter denied the “outrageous allegations"" and resigned from his position.“I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign,” Porter said.Two days after the resignation, Trump wished the former staffer well, saying he hopes Porter has ""a great career ahead of him."" He said the allegations were ""very sad"" and stressed that Porter has maintained his innocence.White House press secretary Sanders said on Dec. 13 that Manigault Newman’s last day with the administration would be on Jan. 20 – exactly one year since Trump’s inauguration.Manigault Newman reportedly drew scrutiny from White House chief of staff John Kelly. She also came under fire for bringing her 39-person bridal party to the White House for a photo shoot in 2017. Cordray’s resignation didn’t come as a surprise; he had previously said he would quit his job by the end of November. But many thought his resignation would set up Trump to appoint his own director of an agency that has been widely criticized by his administration and Republicans alike.However, before his resignation, Cordray elevated his chief of staff Leandra English to the deputy director position – meaning she would become acting CFPB director after he quit. But the White House announced Mick Mulvaney, head of the Office of Management and Budget, as its interim director.The move came after Price received major criticism following reports of his use of private planes.Price had promised to repay the government for the use of his costly flights and vowed never to take a private charter plane again while in his post as secretary but was ultimately let go anyway. White House officials told Fox News that Gorka did not resign but confirmed that he “no longer works” with the administration.However, Gorka insisted to the Washington Examiner that he did actually resign.A former Breitbart news editor, Gorka joined the Trump administration as a counterterrorism adviser and assisted with national security policy decisions alongside Bannon, according to White House sources.The Breitbart News chief joined Trump's presidential campaign and was later appointed to a senior adviser role after Trump won the election.Bannon, the hardcore populist, had become increasingly isolated inside the White House following John Kelly's appointment as chief of staff, White House sources and outside advisers told Fox News.A White House aide told Fox News that Bannon’s ouster wasn’t sudden; he submitted his resignation in writing several weeks prior, the aide said.But Scaramucci himself lasted only 10 days in the White House. He was reportedly removed at the request of new White House chief of staff John Kelly. Kelly was sworn in as chief of staff just hours before Scaramucci was removed. The replacement of Preibus as chief of staff came amid tensions between he and Scaramucci, the White House communications director at the time.“This is the problem with the leaking,” Scaramucci reportedly told reporters. “This is actually a terrible thing. Let’s say I’m firing Michael Short today. The fact that you guys know about it before he does really upsets me as a human being and as a Roman Catholic.”In his position, Shaub was often at odds with the Trump administration, particularly when it came to Trump’s business dealings.Shaub joined the Campaign Legal Center, an organization in Washington that mostly focuses on violations of campaign finance law.He said that he resigned due to “personal” reasons.Trump repeatedly criticized Comey’s handling of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s personal email server, and Comey said after his firing that he felt uncomfortable by comments Trump made about the FBI’s investigation into Michael Flynn.Comey reportedly was speaking to employees in Los Angeles when news of his ousting came across the television. At the time, according to reports, Comey thought it was a prank.She left the White House to join the pro-Trump nonprofit America First Policies.Walsh came to the White House after serving in the Republican National Committee under then-chairman Reince Priebus.The Justice Department said attorneys general who were holdovers from the Obama administration needed to resign. Bharara refused to do so.“I did not resign. Moments ago I was fired,” Bharara tweeted. “Being the US Attorney in [the Southern District of New York] will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life.”“I have nothing to be ashamed for and everything to be proud of,” Flynn told Fox News at the time.Yates refused to enforce Trump’s controversial travel ban and issued a memo to the Justice Department not to defend the executive order.Fox News' Kristin Brown, Jake Gibson, Serafin Gomez, Alex Pappas, John Roberts, Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/17/trump-should-beware-north-koreas-peace-overtures-kim-jong-un-cant-be-trusted.html","If CIA Director Mike Pompeo wins Senate confirmation to become secretary of state, as expected, one of his first challenges will be working to make President Trump’s planned meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un a success. That may prove to be mission impossible.An obvious question arises: Is North Korea responding favorably to the U.S. maximum pressure campaign, or trying to buy time for its nuclear program and wrest concessions from negotiations? The answer is likely both.Feeling the heat, North Korean leaders hope a show of compromise will weaken America’s commitment to the debilitating economic sanctions and robust military deterrence now putting severe pressure on the Communist nation.The Trump administration has expended much effort convincing other nations of the urgency of a maximum pressure approach against North Korea. What better way for the North to upend that effort than to convince the world, and perhaps even President Trump himself, that maximum pressure is no longer necessary?Sensibly, U.S. officials – including incoming Secretary of State Pompeo – have indicated that maximum pressure will continue for now.The North’s charm campaign began at the Olympics, where a smiling Kim Yo Jong, who is Kim Jong Un’s sister, represented the country. Stoking dreams of a unified Korea and playing on desires for peace, she sought to portray North Korea as a responsible and reasonable member of the international community.Suddenly, North and South were talking – not just about the Olympics, but about denuclearization. And the South was conveying the North’s alleged willingness to discuss surrendering nuclear weapons in exchange for a U.S. security guarantee and the normalization of relations.The upcoming meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong Un – assuming it takes place – will give North Korea a historic chance to seduce the media, and could easily lend the brutal, bellicose Kim legitimacy and stature. Just being in the same room with the president of the United States, surrounded by journalists from around the world, would be a publicity triumph for Kim.North Korea has a track record of finessing the United States with the promise of negotiations and the pretense of agreements. Maximum pressure was adopted in the first place because North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs had advanced alarmingly while diplomacy and outreach were tried.Vacillation and incrementalism in the imposition of sanctions and naïve faith in negotiations were recurring features of U.S. policy and were especially evident during the Obama years.No matter how many nuclear and missile tests North Korea carried out, and no matter how many times North Korea backed out of negotiations or violated previously negotiated terms, the Obama/Clinton/Kerry team indicated that compromise and aid were still possible if talks ensued.The Obama administration was willing to pay a high price for a negotiated solution and began by seeking normalization of relations and promised recognition of the cruel North Korean regime’s legitimacy – if only progress was made on the nuclear issue.And under President Obama, the U.S. preemptively offered “no first use” of nuclear weapons and refused to fully enforce sanctions against the North that it supposedly endorsed – but was unable to get North Korea to return to six party talks on nuclear disarmament.In 2012, North Korea did attend bilateral talks that led to a “Leap Day” agreement in which the United States pledged 240,000 metric tons of food in exchange for a freeze on nuclear and missile tests. But the agreement fell apart as North Korea prepared more nuclear tests, declared its nuclear weapons non-negotiable, threatened America with destruction, and rattled South Korea with cyberattacks and military provocations.Indeed, there has not been a correlation between engagement efforts and more cooperative North Korean behavior. Nuclear tests and threats by the North have often occurred at the very time of diplomatic outreach.Although North Korea could conceivably give up its nuclear program in order to save the Kim regime, it is more likely that the North will never give up the nuclear force it has worked so hard to develop, because the force is critical to the survival of the regime and of Kim himself.Acquiescing to denuclearization would undermine the ideas that North Korea is under constant existential threat from geopolitical enemies, that it has a mission to unify the Korean Peninsula and export its ideology, and that Kim is the savior of his people and the only one who can carry out that mission. North Korea’s nuclear program serves its domestic propaganda, and its defensive and offensive aims.If North Korea nevertheless gets serious about terms required for the verifiable dismantlement of its nuclear weapons and missiles, we’d better beware of the terms. And we had better answer the following questions:Should we accept a peace treaty that requires the U.S. to withdraw troops from South Korea, thereby leaving the region and the United States itself vulnerable?Should we normalize relations with a regime with human rights violations that are so encompassing and severe that the regime itself could be said to be running a concentration camp, thereby consigning the North Korean people to their awful fate?Should we give aid to a dictator who will use the assistance to shore up his inner circle?Should we focus only on North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs when it is also a major proliferator of weapons of mass destruction, exchanging chemical weapons technology with Syrian dictator Bashar Assad to help him wage war against his own people?Unless North Korea earns trust, the United States should not only continue maximum pressure; it should increase penalties on every entity that enables the regime, including major Chinese banks.With China intent on image-building, we should expose the devastating human toll of its support for North Korea. The best way to maintain the peace is to weaken the North Korean regime to make its nuclear program impossible to sustain, and heighten our military defenses and resolve."

However, state officials have denied permission for the group to dig at the location, the Associated Press reported.Still, authorities appear to take the claims seriously because on March 13, state officials and the FBI accompanied the group to Dents Run and set up a post. Neither authorities nor the treasure hunters are revealing what is transpiring, however. Indeed, Finders Keepers owner Dennis Parada insisted the FBI had him under forced silence.The only public comment by the FBI is that it is conducting “court-authorized” activity with its participation in the mysterious activity.Finders Keepers has been chasing the legend of the lost Gettysburg gold shipment for some time. Rumor has it that President Abraham Lincoln sent 52 bars of gold — some tales set the number at 26 — toward the Harrisburg area in 1863 to be used to pay his soldiers.But somehow en route from Wheeling, West Virginia, the wagon carrying the precious cargo was attacked, and the gold disappeared. The wagon, along with a contingent of dead federal soldiers, was later found, but the gold had vanished. The last time the wagon and its escort were seen was in St. Marys, Pennsylvania.The shipment would be worth up to $55 million today.According to WJAC, in 2012, Finders Keepers claimed it tracked the gold to an area in Dents Run but could not come up with the $15,000 bond the state had demanded to begin digging.The group says they found the gold using high-powered metal detecting devices.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Hogg suggests Lamb’s victory is proof Americans have had “enough.”However, Hogg’s summary overlooks the fact that Lamb won on a pro-gun campaign.

It wants to see the effects of the American political process on the Palestinian leadership and Abbas’ situation specifically.“Hamas is currently playing two sides,” he said. “On the one hand, it is cooperating with Egypt regarding reconciliation, but at the same time it continues to make efforts to revive its military and political capabilities in the West Bank. Hamas is using the discord within Fatah, especially the differences between Abbas and his rival in Fatah’s leadership Muhammed Dahlan, to influence the appointment of the heir.”The source added that Israel and the U.S. would like to see Palestinian security officials, especially Palestinian general intelligence commander Majed Faraj, to continue their influence over Palestinian politics, but what’s certain is that there won’t be any one figure who will manage to take up all three of Abbas’ positions: director general of the PLO, president of the PA and chair of Fatah.“There will be a cooperative leadership, with the name of Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fiad coming up in the past few months,” said the source. “The problem is that Fatah is prepared to join forces with Hamas to block Dahlan’s path and Dahlan isn’t ruling out cooperation with Hamas in order to harm Abbas. The problem with the countries of the region doesn’t allow for a process to prevent any scenario in which the internal Palestinian situation will be used by Iran.”According to the source, Jordan is particularly worried over the possible return of Fatah’s armed militias, which would be fertile ground for Hezbollah and Iran’s Revolutionary Guard to try and spark attacks and anarchy.“The working assumption is a situation in which Hamas will try to sell itself as a legitimate, moderate player who is worthy of being part of a new ruling order and that would be Iran’s opportunity to crawl in through its people in Hamas,” he said. “And the countries of the region are meant to give their opinion and prevent this scenario.”According to the source, Palestinian security forces have recently been making efforts to prevent young Palestinians, especially those in the refugee camps, from joining up with hostile, pro-Iranian groups and Salafist elements in Palestinian circles, especially in the West Bank.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

He’s also a Christian, he’s pro-life, and he wants safer neighborhoods that aren’t sanctuaries for illegal gang members.”The district Navarro is running in consists of a majority Latino and African-American population and approximately 60 percent of registered voters are Democrats.“Thanks to Lieutenant General Michael Flynn for endorsing my campaign for congress against Low IQ Maxine Waters,” Navarro wrote on his Facebook page ahead of Friday’s event. “I’m excited to see him Friday for my fundraiser.”Flynn’s endorsement of Navarro reaffirms his belief that he’s the only candidate who can beat Waters in the upcoming election.In November, Navarro was endorsed by several more big names at an event at the Trump National Golf Course in Rancho Palos Verdes.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/17/calling-america-land-opportunity-microaggression-says-university-california/","The University of California has published a list of unacceptable “microaggressions” on its official website, which includes offensive statements such as “America is the land of opportunity.”The Academic Affairs department of the University of California Santa Cruz provides the list of politically incorrect expressions and actions to students and faculty to equip them to recognize microaggressions and eliminate them.Examples of allegedly “racist” microaggressions furnished by the university include statements such as: “When I look at you, I don’t see color,” “There is only one race, the human race,” and “America is a melting pot.”It is also a microaggression to say that “the most qualified person should get the job” or to express doubts about the effectiveness of Affirmative Action programs, the website claims. Moreover, to say that “America is the land of opportunity” propagates the “myth of meritocracy,” as do statements such as “Everyone can succeed in this society, if they work hard enough.”The University of California offers a helpful definition of microaggressions to better educate the academic community in politically correct behavior.“Microaggressions are the everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership,” the website states.“The first step in addressing microaggressions is to recognize when a microaggression has occurred and what message it may be sending,” the university declares, before proceeding to enumerate common offenses.According to the Academic Affairs department, microaggressions vary with context and race, so saying something to a black or Asian person is different from saying it to a white person.For example, it is perfectly acceptable to ask a Caucasian student “Why are you so quiet? We want to know what you think,” whereas to ask this same question of an Asian, Latino or Native American constitutes a microaggression, because it implies that they have not successfully assimilated to “the dominant culture.”Similarly, asking a black person “Why do you have to be so loud/animated?” is strictly verboten, while asking a white person this question is completely fine.Moreover, whites should never use the expression “You people” when speaking to blacks, whereas blacks may address whites in this way, the university suggests.In the eyes of the university, microaggressions also extend to the area of sexual identity or orientation, and include limiting options on official forms to “Male or Female” when identifying one’s sex, or offering only two options for relationship status: married or single.UC Santa Cruz has been a pioneer in the war against microaggressions and in 2016 hosted a forum titled “Microaggression in the Classroom.” The event was part of UCSC’s “Mentoring Program for Faculty,” sponsored by the Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.If you find the double standards and outright foolishness of academic political correctness off-putting, you are in good company.In a brilliant article in Forbes during the 2016 presidential campaign, the celebrated British historian Paul Johnson called political correctness “one of the most dangerous intellectual afflictions ever to attack mankind.”PC has “enormous appeal to the semieducated,” Johnson observed, and it “appeals to pseudo-intellectuals everywhere, since it evokes the strong streak of cowardice notable among those wielding academic authority nowadays.”“Any empty-headed student with a powerful voice can claim someone (never specified) will be ‘hurt’ by a hitherto harmless term, object or activity and be reasonably assured that the dons and professors in charge will show a white feather and do as the student demands,” he said.“Thus, there isn’t a university campus on either side of the Atlantic that’s not in danger of censorship,” he concluded.Follow Thomas D.

And Ohio is training teachers, it’s actually a private organization that’s training the teachers. There are, depending on the laws and how you look at the them, anywhere from 12 to 25 states that are already to some degree allowing teachers to be armed in schools.While Pratt stressed that teachers should under no circumstance carry unless state/local law allows, he did note that now is the time to change laws so more teachers can be armed for self-defense.He added, “We protect our President, Congressmen, and banks with guns, why is it that we protect our schools with just a sign that says, ‘No Guns Allowed’?

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/16/jeff-sessions-gives-andy-mccabe-the-boot-may-deny-him-fbi-pension/","Attorney General Jeff Sessions, acting on the recommendation of the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR), fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew “Andy” McCabe Friday.By dismissing McCabe – who was set to retire at the end of the month – before Sunday, Sessions may have jeopardized McCabe’s ability to draw a pension. Speculation Sessions might make this move has stirred since the Department of Justice Inspector General’s report, which is yet to be publically disclosed, was reported to have recommend McCabe be fired over his handling of press disclosures during his investigation of the Clinton Foundation. The OPR, upon reviewing the IG’s report, issued a recommendation to fire McCabe.Attorney General Sessions issued the following statement, announcing his decision:After an extensive and fair investigation and according to Department of Justice procedure, the Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) provided its report on allegations of misconduct by Andrew McCabe to the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR).The FBI’s OPR then reviewed the report and underlying documents and issued a disciplinary proposal recommending the dismissal of Mr. McCabe. Both the OIG and FBI OPR reports concluded that Mr. McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions.The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability. As the OPR proposal stated, “all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand.”Pursuant to Department Order 1202, and based on the report of the Inspector General, the findings of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility, and the recommendation of the Department’s senior career official, I have terminated the employment of Andrew McCabe effective immediately.McCabe reportedly already had stepped down from his number two spot at the FBI following the House Intelligence Committee’s review of a memo dealing with, among other things, McCabe’s handling of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant application.***Update***Andrew McCabe has responded with a statement: I have been an FBI Special Agent for over 21 years. I spent half of that time investigating Russian Organized Crime as a street agent and Supervisor in New York City. I have spent the second half of my career focusing on national security issues and protecting this country from terrorism. I served in some of the most challenging, demanding investigative and leadership roles in the FBI. And I was privileged to serve as Deputy Director during a particularly tough time.For the last year and a half, my family and I have been the targets of an unrelenting assault on our reputation and my service to this country. Articles too numerous to count have leveled every sort of false, defamatory and degrading allegation against us. The president’s tweets have amplified and exacerbated it all. He called for my firing. He called for me to be stripped of my pension after more than 20 years of service. And all along we have said nothing, never wanting to distract from the mission of the FBI by addressing the lies told and repeated about it.No more.The investigation by the Justice Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) has to be understood in the context of the attacks on my credibility. The investigation flows from my attempt to explain the FBI’s involvement and my supervision of investigations involving Hillary Clinton. I was being portrayed in the media over and over as a political partisan, accused of closing down investigations under political pressure. The FBI was portrayed as caving under that pressure, and making decisions for political rather than law enforcement purposes. Nothing was further from the truth. In fact, this entire investigation stems from my efforts, fully authorized under FBI rules, to set the record straight on behalf of the Bureau and to make it clear that we were continuing an investigation that people in DOJ opposed.The OIG investigation has focused on information I chose to share with a reporter through my public affairs officer and a legal counselor. As Deputy Director, I was one of only a few people who had the authority to do that. It was not a secret, it took place over several days, and others, including the Director, were aware of the interaction with the reporter. It was the same type of exchange with the media that the Deputy Director oversees several times per week. In fact it was the same type of work that I continued to do under Director Wray, at his request. The investigation subsequently focused on who I talked to, when I talked to them, and so forth. During these inquiries, I answered questions truthfully and as accurately as I could amidst the chaos that surrounded me. And when I thought my answers were misunderstood, I contacted investigators to correct them.But looking at that in isolation completely misses the big picture. The big picture is a tale of what can happen when law enforcement is politicized, public servants are attacked, and people who are supposed to cherish and protect our institutions become instruments for damaging those institutions and people.Here is the reality: I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey. The release of this report was accelerated only after my testimony to the House Intelligence Committee revealed that I would corroborate former Director Comey’s accounts of his discussions with the President. The OIG’s focus on me and this report became a part of an unprecedented effort by the Administration, driven by the President himself, to remove me from my position, destroy my reputation, and possibly strip me of a pension that I worked 21 years to earn. The accelerated release of the report, and the punitive actions taken in response, make sense only when viewed through this lens. Thursday’s comments from the White House are just the latest example of this.This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally. It is part of this Administration’s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel’s work.I have always prided myself on serving my country with distinction and integrity, and I have always encouraged those around me to do the same. Just ask them. To have my career end in this way, and to be accused of lacking candor when at worst I was distracted in the misty fo chaotic events, is incredibly disappointing and unfair. But it will not erase the important work I was prevailed to be a part of, the results of which will in the end be revealed for the country to see.I have unfailing faith in the men and women of the FBI and I am confident that their efforts to seek justice will not be deterred.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/16/npr-florida-school-shooting-heinous-no-epidemic/","On March 15, NPR noted the heinous nature of Florida’s Parkland school shooting but quickly added that claims school shootings are at epidemic levels are false.NPR’s observation is drawn from the work of Northeastern University’s James Alan Fox, who demonstrates that there were more “multiple victim” school shootings during the 1990’s than now.According to NPR, Fox shows that “in the 1992-93 school year, about 0.55 students per million were shot and killed; in 2014-15, that rate was closer to 0.15 per million.”He demonstrates that the U.S. suffers, on average, one multiple victim shooting per school year. And Fox points out that that means an average of one a year in a nation of over 100,000 schools.So why do so many Americans believe we have an epidemic of school shootings? Fox believes the answer to that lies in a perception derived from media coverage and other outlets.He said, “The difference is the impression, the perception that people have. Today we have cell phone recordings of gunfire that play over and over and over again. So it’s that the impression is very different. That’s why people think things are a lot worse now, but the statistics say otherwise.”Dr. Garen Wintemute, an emergency room physician doing “gun violence” research at University of California, Davis, concurs with Fox. Wintemute said, “Schools are just about the safest place in the world for kids to be. Although each one of them is horrific and rivets the entire nation for a period of time, mass shootings at schools are really very uncommon, and they are not increasing in frequency. What’s changed is how aware we are of them.”Madysen Pruss is a counselor at Marysville Pilchuck High School, which suffered a mass shooting on October 24, 2014. Yet Pruss says her response to other shootings around the country is to talk to students about “how it’s publicized through social media. So it makes the threat feel greater than it is.”AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

The girl allegedly woke up to Uribe touching her genitals.Screenshot of Uribe via WTVD.The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency confirmed to Breitbart News that Uribe is an illegal alien who was previously deported in 2008 when he was accused of child sex crimes.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) placed a detainer on Oscar Paez Uribe, aka Santiago Jaminez Maldonado, 39, a citizen and national of Mexico, Feb. 21, after his arrest by the Wake County Sheriff’s Office on multiple charges, including indecent liberties with a child and first-degree kidnapping. He was previously removed from the United States April 24, 2008. [Emphasis added]According to WTVD, prosecutors said in court that Uribe had evaded a criminal trial for child sex crimes previously in the U.S. because he was instead deported back to Mexico. Prosecutors also asked Judge Craig Croom to set a $500,000 bond on the illegal alien.Croom, though, set a bond of $300,000, along with restrictions on the illegal alien, including no contact with the victim’s family and no unsupervised contact with any minor under the age of 16-years-old.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/16/former-koch-exec-marc-short-trump-anxious-for-daca-amnesty-wants-to-protect-illegal-aliens/","Former “Never Trump” Koch brothers executive turned White House staffer Marc Short contradicted previous statements by President Trump’s administration this week, claiming the president is “open” to negotiations in granting amnesty to nearly 800,000 illegal aliens without pro-American immigration reforms.Short — who formerly ran the failed “Never Trump” effort inside the Koch brothers’ network of organizations — told the media at the White House on Friday that not only is Trump “open” to discussions about amnesty for the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens shielded from deportation by the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, but he’s also “anxious” to cut a deal on the issue.REPORTER: With DACA, is there room for a smaller deal? Are you working a smaller deal now, one that does not have all four pillars, but that might be part of the omnibus?MARC SHORT: As we said, the president has been very open to continuing negotiations on this. He’s anxious to get a deal. He believes that it’s important to secure our border, but he also believes passionately that these are people who have been in our country, who are working productively, and in order to get a DACA permit, have been obeying the law. So he wants to protect them. We’re anxious to find a way to get a deal. [Emphasis added]The White House, however,  this week denied to Breitbart News on two occasions that Trump is interested in a plan similar to the one being pushed by pro-open borders Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) in which amnesty would be given to potentially millions of DACA-enrolled and DACA-eligible illegal aliens in exchange for three years of funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.White House spokesman Raj Shah told Breitbart News earlier this week:“The White House opposes a so-called three for three deal,” Shah said. “In fact, as a result of the caps deal, the routine appropriations process should yield wall funding in the Omnibus. Securing the border is one of the most vital functions of government and is a core part of any routine funding bill. Separately, we have never stopped working to negotiate an immigration reform package that addresses DACA, stops illegal immigration and secures and modernizes our legal immigration system.” [Emphasis added]Then, separately, when Breitbart News asked Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley if Trump was eyeing a DACA amnesty to be slipped into the upcoming funding bill, the official said: “Just talked to the team. FALSE.”Such a plan to slip a DACA amnesty into the funding bill for merely short-term border wall funding would betray Trump’s previous commitment that in order to allow only DACA-enrolled illegal aliens to stay in the country, a slew of immigration reforms would have to be put in place, including:Trump’s biggest effort — not mentioned by Short — has been to get the Republican-controlled Congress to end the process known as “chain migration,” whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S.In an explosive report, Breitbart News revealed that chain migration, if not ended, is expected to add between seven and eight million new foreign-born voters to the U.S. electorate—a scheme that favors Democrats, as immigrants – specifically Hispanics and Asians – vote 2-to-1 for Democrats over Republicans.Since 2005, chain migration has imported more than nine million foreign nationals to the U.S., making it the largest driver of immigration—more than 70 percent of all legal immigration. As Breitbart News reported, five years of chain migration to the U.S. adds more people to the country than one year of American births.Additionally, should current legal immigration policy remain the same for the next 50 years, 100 million foreign-born people will be added to the U.S. population, Breitbart News reported.Short’s comments that Trump is looking to “protect” DACA illegal aliens comes less than a month after DACA illegal alien Judas Deluna, 21-years-old, is accused of murdering a Texas store owner, Breitbart Texas reported.Surveillance footage of accused killer, DACA illegal alien Judas Deluna.Also, most recently, a DACA illegal alien was accused of threatening to shoot up an upstate New York high school, writing on social media: “I’m coming tomorrow morning and I’m going to shoot all of ya bitches.”Short’s former bosses, the pro-mass immigration Koch brothers, have released an ad campaign in which they call DACA illegal aliens “patriots” and demand an immediate amnesty for the illegal population, Breitbart News reported.Under a DACA amnesty, American taxpayers would be left with a $26 billion bill. About one in five DACA illegal aliens, after an amnesty, would end up on food stamps, while at least one in seven would go on Medicaid. Since DACA’s inception under Obama, more than 2,100 illegal aliens have been kicked off the program after it was revealed that they were either criminals or gang members.Also, as Breitbart News reported, only four percent of DACA illegal aliens have completed a college education, making the DACA population far less likely than the native American population to finish college with a degree.Another 25 percent of DACA illegal aliens, Breitbart News reported, are “functionally illiterate” in the English language, despite being touted by the open borders lobby as being highly-educated and highly-skilled.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/16/exclusive-rep-mo-brooks-unveils-legislation-to-end-the-government-shutdown/","Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview how his new legislation would prevent government shutdowns and avoid the partisan brinkmanship over federal spending battles. Congressman Brooks unveiled H.R. 5313, a bill that would continue to fund the government at last year’s spending levels in the event of a government funding lapse to avoid government shutdown fights that end up raising government spending. Rep. Brooks explained to Breitbart News, “Whatever spending was for the previous year, the various agencies continue at the same exact spending level. No increase, no cut, and as an aside if you have a set spending amount then government decreases over the long run.”The Alabama conservative continued, “The second thing it does is prevent the special interest groups from adding bad provisions to the legislation or else face a government shutdown threat. The government shutdown threat is the last card played by the powers that be to force legislators into voting for bad legislation that they otherwise would not vote for because no one likes a shutdown.” “It’s these massive spending increases that increase our massive bankruptcy risk,” Brooks added, contended that the recent spending battles raised the national debt to new heights.  Congressional leadership has yet to unveil its omnibus spending bill to fund the federal government ahead of the March 23 deadline. Reports suggest that the leadership could release the bill as early as Sunday or Monday. However, conservatives remain more skeptical of that timeline. Congressional leadership passed a two-year, $300 billion, 652-page budget under in 18 hours, much to the dismay of conservatives.It’s a “Christmas tree on steroids,” Congressman Dave Brat (R-VA) said in February, suggesting that the spending bill is full of pork barrel spending.Sen. Paul asked, “Are we to be conservative all the time or only when we’re in the minority?”Republicans remain unable to pass a government funding bill by themselves because they need nine Democrats in the Senate to vote for a government spending bill; this often forces Republicans to cut deals with the Democrats that jack up government spending.President Donald Trump, as well as House conservatives, have called for the Senate to drop the 60-vote threshold needed to pass legislation.Congressman Dave Brat (R-VA), another member of the House Freedom Caucus, told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview how the Democrats used the 60 vote threshold in the Senate to dramatically raise spending.Brat said, “We had a Republican call to plus up the military and keep everything else constant in the Senate and to get the Democrat votes to plus up $400 billion.”“I haven’t seen any ideas on cost containment from the Democrats at all,” Brat added. Brooks warned that our national debt has skyrocketed in recent years to untenable levels. “This year, we’re looking at a deficit of $750 to $1 trillion. Next year, the estimate is $1 trillion or more. I have to wonder if there is any way that we can avoid a national insolvency or bankruptcy.”Four conservatives, including House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC), Rep. Raul Labrador (R-ID), Rep. Mark Sanford (R-SC), and Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), cosponsored Brooks’ legislation to end the government shutdown and the subsequent spending showdown that spikes the nation’s debt.Brooks then told Breitbart News that the bill would minimize the power of Republicans and Democrats to jack up spending during a government shutdown fight.Congressman Brooks said, “It would minimize the power of Democrats for their shutdown power plays to force bad policy, but that’s no different than what Republicans do on a regular basis too.”Rep. Brooks continued, “Government shutdowns hurt the party that is in power. Short-term spending bills hurt the party that is in power. It suggests that the party does not know how to govern and does not deserve to govern.”Brat then told Breitbart News why believes the bill will rein in government spending. Brat said, “It’s easy, Mo Brooks has a piece I agree with, you just got to end the shutdown procedure, and all you have to do is just reversion to last year’s budget. If there’s a ‘shutdown’ then you just revert to last year’s numbers. Then you make sure that the budget goes in a downward direction instead of a crisis mode were we jack up the numbers.”The Virginia Republican then suggested that although fellow lawmakers have praised the bill, many members have also made empty promises about balanced budget amendments and term limits.“Everybody is for it just like everyone is for a balanced budget amendment and term limits,” Brat told Breitbart News. “Everyone is for it, but we’ll see how many people vote for it.”Congressman Brat then suggested that switching to a simple majority in the Senate would make it easier to pass an appropriations bill to fund the government. However, he added that the Senate does not like to take hard votes.Brat charged, “Senators have to get re-elected every six years, and they can’t take a hard vote once every six years. We all want to change the Senate bills, even if it’s just on appropriations bills, to just a majority rule. Then you don’t run into these crises every year.”Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) told Breitbart News Daily on Wednesday that she would like the Senate to switch to a simple majority vote to fund the government.Blackburn told Breitbart News Daily:For issues of funding your constitutionally required to fund the government, it should be majority rule.If they want to have to have their 60 vote rule, which I think is ridiculous, apply that only to the legislative calendar; not the executive calendar or funding, which you have to do for the American people. Brat concluded, “You know what’s going to happen [with the omnibus] and it’s going to be filled with everything that senators want because they have a majority of one. They can oppose and block the country’s progress, and we got to end that system.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/16/wage-growth-for-american-workers-threatened-by-lack-of-wall-expected-rise-in-illegal-immigration/","Illegal immigration pouring across the United States-Mexico border is likely to rise this year, according to a Princeton University expert, as President Trump’s border wall has yet to be constructed.In an interview with the Washington Examiner‘s Paul Bedard, Princeton Policy Adviser President Steven Kopits said illegal immigration in 2018 is likely to increase by 70 percent — or about 590,000 border-crossings for 2018.Such an increase, Kopits told the Washington Examiner, would put 2018 as the “second highest year since 2010” for illegal immigration on the southern border.The report comes as Trump’s proposed border wall has yet to be paid for and constructed, leaving the southern border just as open as it was under former President Obama.The spike in illegal immigration for this year would translate into suppressing wage gains for American workers, who over the last couple of months have enjoyed historic wage growth due to increased immigration enforcement and less illegal immigration in 2017 largely due to Trump’s rhetoric.In Kopits’ most recent report on illegal immigration, he notes that California’s farm wages for Americans have increased because of slower illegal immigration throughout 2017 and increased enforcement, with the caveat, “However, the more enforcement succeeds, the higher wages will go, and the greater the incentive to evade the ban. In California, for example, tougher border enforcement has raised farm wages to $16 / hour, up perhaps $5 / hour over earlier times.”Those wages gains, though, risk being depleted this year. Also running the risk of being depleted is history-making wage growth for American workers in the construction industry, the garment industry, for workers employed at small businesses, and black Americans.As Breitbart News most recently reported, businesses such as Walmart, Dollar Tree, Target, Foot Locker, J.C. Penney, Bojangles, Abercrombie & Fitch, Ross, and Burlington Coat Factory have mentioned that there is pressure for them to raise Americans’ wages in Trump’s tightened labor market.But, should illegal immigration, along with legal immigration levels, continue – where the U.S. admits more than one million foreign nationals to the country every year — the wage pressure currently on corporations could be ended.Already, Americans have seen stagnant wage growth as border-crossings have continued to increase under Trump. For example, in February 2018, the number of illegal aliens apprehended at the southern border increased by more than 2.5 percent.At the same time, wage growth for Americans has become stagnant again, as Reuters noted:Wage growth is watched closely by the Fed as evidence of the labor market’s strength, and at 2.6 percent year over year remains “disappointing…It is still too soon to declare full employment,” said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.Slow wage growth for Americans would drive down incentives for likely voters to turn out in the midterm elections for Republicans, as the supposed stricter immigration enforcement touted by the White House would not be translating into benefits for the working and middle class.This week, Trump visited the border wall prototypes in San Diego, California. Though the administration has said the process is necessary, the prototypes have been sitting in the San Diego desert for over half a year now, with no timeline in sight of when the construction of the wall will break ground.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

[Chuck] Schumer and Senate Democrats in confirming our nominees to enable us to fill out our White House.”“The Senate obviously has the constitutional responsibility for advice and consent,” said Short who then proceeded to describe “what that looks like in real life.”After the President selects a nominee, that person goes through an FBI background check, “they work with the office of government ethics to deconflict financial issues,” and after this extensive process the nominee is submitted to the U.S. Senate.There the individual goes through “several additional evaluations” including meetings with members and staff from both sides of the aisle. The nominee is then submitted to a committee hearing and vote, after which the nominee is submitted for a confirmation vote on the Senate floor.“Traditionally the Senate routinely confirms an administration’s nominees once out of committee,” said Short. “What Sen. Schumer has done, is to require cloture votes to essentially slow down the process and to obstruct.”Short then recounted the pace and history of Senate confirmations and cloture or “filibuster” of them under the four previous administrations. In the first 14 months of the Trump administration, the Senate had 79 cloture votes on Trump administration nominees.He contrasted the 79 cloture votes under Trump to a combined 17 cloture votes in the same time period under all of the four prior administrations, or five times as many. Under President George H.W. Bush’s entire four-year term “he faced one cloture vote,” said Short. In four years President Bill Clinton faced just ten total cloture votes. In his entire first term, President George W. Bush faced four cloture votes. President Barack Obama endured 17 total cloture votes in his first four-year term in office. That’s a total of 32 combined over the entire first terms of the prior four presidents.“Sen. Schumer is essentially weaponizing a Senate procedure in demanding cloture votes on our nominees that he even eventually supports,” Short emphasized. “Eleven of the President’s nominees have been confirmed without a single dissenting vote, yet still forced to go through 30 hours of debate to essentially slow down the Senate calendar, simply for the purpose of obstruction.” Short pointed to some Senate Democrats who have called out the obstruction as “ridiculous,” though he did not name which ones he was referring to.“At this rate, the United States Senate would take eleven and a half years to confirm our nominees,” explained Short.Short went on to list several nominees who have been waiting for confirmation for substantial periods of time, as of Friday: Deputy Secretary of Labor nominee Patrick Pizzella (nominated 269 days prior), Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency nominee Andrew Wheeler (nominated 152 days prior), Assistant Secretary of State for Arms Control nominee Yleem Poblete (nominated 298 days prior), Treasury Department Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis nominee Isabel Patelunas (nominated 270 days prior), and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner nominee Kevin McAleenan (nominated 298 days prior).Pizzella moved out of committee last October and had been confirmed for a position in the George W. Bush administration “by unanimous voice vote.” Wheeler passed out of committee last November. Poblete was previously staff director for the Foreign Affairs Committee.

Maxine Waters (D-CA) and the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) must end their “partisan hypocrisy” and denounce “leftist hate speech” such as that proclaimed by anti-Semite and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.In a press release sent to Breitbart News, Rev. William Owens, president of the Coalition of African American Pastors (CAAP) refers to Farrakhan’s statement in a recent speech: “White folks are going down. And Satan is going down. And Farrakhan, by God’s grace, has pulled the cover off of that Satanic Jew and I’m here to say your time is up, your world is through.”Owens observes Waters was among those present at Farrakhan’s speech.“Rep. Waters’ refusal to speak out against Farrakhan and other extremist hate speech is the perfect example of the hypocrisy and moral cowardice of the Congressional Black Caucus,” Owens says. “Rep. Waters lives in a multi-million dollar home, a stark contrast to the poor district she represents. She manipulates African American voters for her own gain. And she’s just one of many black leaders who have sold out our values.”https://t.co/6ltnDeROWI— Rev. William Owens (@caapusa) February 15, 2018In February, Waters appeared on a BET special program that focused on President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address – though Waters herself did not attend the event as a protest against the president. She said, nevertheless, that Trump is a “racist.”“One speech cannot and does not make Donald Trump presidential,” she said. “He’s not presidential, and he never will be presidential. He claims that’s bringing people together but make no mistake, he is a dangerous, unprincipled, divisive, and shameful racist.”Additionally, in January, a photograph of then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and Farrakhan taken in 2005 at a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus was released after a 13-year cover-up to protect Obama’s political career.Owens joined civil rights educator Dr. Alveda King and other black leaders in February to publicly rebuke the CBC as a “disgrace” and “traitors” to black Americans. The leaders accused CBC members of engaging in “childish” behavior during the State of the Union address, with their “sulking in their seats, texting, pretending to be disinterested.”“Without question, the CBC’s foul demeanor has been a just cause to demand either ‘REPRESENT or GO AWAY,’” Owens said at the time. “I make a strong plea to the black community to embrace this position with openness and hear us out; we have been sidelined by traitors in Washington and must engage.”Owens and his group have launched a petition to hold the CBC accountable to the “values and needs of the African American community.” The petition further says many “so-called ‘civil rights leaders’ have lost touch with the moral values of mainstream African Americans.”“We’ve watched for years as Democratic politicians offered African Americans platitudes and promises in exchange for political loyalty,” Owens asserts, adding:In the meantime, Democratic policies reduced our inner cities to crumbling, crime-ridden, economic wastelands. And yet, we are supposed to continue on, not questioning the policies or politicians that brought us to this point? African American voters have had enough of the double standards and hypocrisy. There is a great hunger for moral leadership in this country. If the Congressional Black Caucus does not step up to meet that demand, they will find themselves in need of new jobs.“Politicians like Maxine Waters need to step up or go home,” Owens says. “We’ve had enough of their partisan games. They’re stooges of a party that enriches them, but does nothing to help the African American community.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/16/text-messages-fbi-agent-peter-strzok-was-friends-with-judge-presiding-over-michael-flynn-case/","New text messages discovered by congressional investigators between two FBI agents who worked on the Trump-Russia investigation reveal that one of them was close friends with the judge who had presided over Michael Flynn’s case before being abruptly recused.The text messages, handed over by the Justice Department to Congress, show that FBI Special Agent Peter Strzok and his mistress, FBI attorney Lisa Page, had discussed Strzok’s personal relationship with District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras and whether or not it would be a conflict of interest.According to investigative journalist Sara Carter, Page wrote to Strzok on July 25, 2016, referring to the secret court that grants surveillance warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act: “Rudy is on the FISC! Did you know that? Just appointed two months ago.”Strzok responds later: “I did. We talked about it before and after. I need to get together with him.”He also wrote: “….She brought up a good point about being circumspect in talking to him in terms of not placing him into a situation where he’d have to recuse himself.”Page responded: “I can’t imagine you either one of you could talk about anything in detail meaningful enough to warrant recusal.”Strzok then expresses skepticism over whether it would not be a conflict of interest, given their friendship.He joked: “Really? Rudy. I’m in charge of espionage for the FBI. Any espionage FISA comes before him, what should he do? Given his friend oversees them?”Page wrote back: “Standards for recusal are quite high. I just don’t think this poses an actual conflict. And he doesn’t know what you do?”Strzok expressed doubt: “Generally he does know what I do. Not the level or scope or area but he’s super thoughtful and rigorous about ethics and conflicts.”He then said someone — whose name is redacted — suggested he and Contreras meet at a “social setting” for “cover.”“(redacted) suggested a social setting with others would probably be better than a one on one meeting. I’m sorry, I’m just going to have to invite you to that cocktail party. Of course, you’ll be there. Have to come up with some other work people cover for action.”Page replied: “Why more? Six is a perfectly fine dinner party.”It is not clear whether Strzok’s relationship with Contreras had anything to do with his recusal on the case, and some legal experts point out that it is not uncommon for federal prosecutors to know judges outside of the courtroom, particularly those serving in the same area.But the texts have raised questions for lawmakers exercising oversight of the DOJ.Rep. Jim Jordan, member of the House Judiciary and Oversight Committees, told Carter: “Why did Contreras recuse himself?”“Text messages show he had a relationship with Strzok …Why did the DOJ make it difficult for us to get the information? To me, those are the two fundamental questions. We don’t know that answers to either one of those ”Rep. Mark Meadows (R-SC) told Carter: “I think from my standpoint we’re asking the Department of Justice and the FBI to give us the documents we need to do proper oversight.”“Failing to be able to provide Congress with those documents in an expeditious manner would certainly strengthen the case for a special prosecutor,” he said. “There is no reason why we cannot get the same documents the Inspector General has.”Their complaints come as the chairmen of the House Oversight and Judiciary Committees and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee are calling for a second special counsel to look into any improper behavior at the FBI and the DOJ.Strzok and Page’s text messages occurred July 2016, just as the FBI launched its investigation into the Trump campaign. Later, the FBI would seek a surveillance warrant on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. It is not known which judge signed off on the warrant, though there are unconfirmed reports that it was Contreras.Strzok and another agent would then interview Flynn in January 2017 about his phone conversations with Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergei Kisylak. Although Strzok and then-FBI Director James Comey reportedly believed that Flynn had not lied or intentionally misled, Flynn was later charged by Special Counsel Robert Mueller with one count of lying.Strzok himself was removed from Mueller’s team in July 2017 after hundreds of pages of text messages between he and Page were found by the Justice Department inspector general, who was investigating bias in handling the Clinton email investigation and the Trump-Russia investigation. Page had already finished her assignment on the team when they were discovered. The two were reportedly engaged in an extramarital affair.Strzok and Page had served on the Clinton email investigation, the FBI’s initial investigation into the Trump campaign, and the subsequent special counsel team. In text messages throughout that time, they expressed loathing of Trump and support for Clinton.Contreras presided over Flynn’s Dec. 1, 2017 hearing in which the former national security adviser pleaded guilty. He was abruptly recused from the case days later, on Dec. 7, 2017, without any public explanation. The new judge, Emmet Sullivan, requested that the special counsel provide any evidence that would be favorable to Flynn’s case.Some legal experts pointed out it was standard operating procedure for Sullivan, but lawyer Margot Cleveland said he also entered a footnote with the order that explained why evidence favorable to Flynn, even after a guilty plea, could be a basis for throwing out the plea.Jordan and other members told Carter they were facing restrictive rules from the DOJ in viewing the text messages.They said the DOJ only allowed them to review the text messages at DOJ headquarters and only highly redacted text messages were allowed to be removed for their oversight of the Justice Department’s handling of the Trump-Russia investigation.They said of 1.2 million documents collected by the Justice Department Inspector General, the House Oversight Committee has only received 3,162 “unique documents.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

But it may also be constructive chaos. That is, perhaps stocks are rising not despite the chaos but because of it. After all, at the heart of the chaos is President Donald Trump consolidating control of his administration and one thing we’ve learned from the last year is that the stock market likes a strong, victorious Trump and loathes a weakened Trump.The major indexes ended the day up a bit or flat. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.29 percent. The S&P 500 ticked up 0.17 percent. The Nasdaq Composite ended the day precisely where it began it, like some endless argument on Twitter. The Russel 2000 index of small-cap stocks was the biggest winner, up 0.6 percent.Shares of Tiffany & Co. fell by 5.06 percent on Friday even though the company reported earnings that beat analyst estimates.One problem: same-store sales were down in most of its regions.  Another: the company’s forecast for full-year profits were disappointing.But Tiffany may have a deeper problem. Beneath the gangbuster headline consumer sentiment numbers–they showed consumers are the happiest they’ve been since 2004–the University of Michigan survey revealed that optimism about the future is declining in American households with the top third of incomes. These households account for about half of all consumer spending–and likely far more than that of consumer spending on expensive jewelry the comes in little blue boxes.Analysts tout Tiffany’s new products, such as a home-goods collection that features $9,000 sterling silver balls of year. But that’s not something that is likely to end up on the shopping list of the lower-income consumers driving the high confidence numbers. So any loss of confidence by the higher-income households will likely hurt sales at Tiffany.The conventional wisdom about the collapse of Toys R Us blames it all on the private equity guys who bought the company several years ago, borrowing most of the money to do it, and extracted a few hundred million while they owned it.While there’s a certain attraction to blaming leverage and Wall Street for the failure of Toys R Us, there’s little logic to it. Toys R Us would have likely been bankrupt long ago if it had not taken money from lenders and the few hundred million extracted by its private equity owners would not have prolonged its life either. The story of what happened to Toys R Us is more complex. It is, really, the story of the transformation of middle America–a story told here. MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2018/03/16/klein-six-lowlights-globalist-pro-islamist-h-r-mcmasters-career/","NEW YORK — Amid widespread reports that National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster is expected to lose his job within days, it is instructive to recall the troubling ideology and concerning connections of the man who has been serving in one of the most powerful U.S. national security positions.Below, in no particular order, are six Breitbart News exposes authored by this reporter that unearthed McMaster’s disturbing ties and ideology.1 – McMaster repeatedly minimized the religious motivations of Islamic terrorist groups.As Trump’s national security adviser, McMaster has faced controversy numerous times for repeatedly minimizing the religious motivations of terrorist groups, including referring to the ideology of Mideast jihadists as “irreligious” in an interview last December.In November, after Sayfullo Saipov plowed into a crowd of pedestrians and bicyclists in Lower Manhattan, killing eight people, McMaster referred to the attack as among a grouping of “mass murderers.”This despite reports Saipov left behind a note declaring that the attack was perpetuated in the name of the Islamic State. And witnesses heard Saipov shouting “Allahu Akbar!,” Arabic for “Allah is great,” during the terrorist assault.  IS claimed responsibility for the attack.One month earlier, McMaster labeled the September 11, 2001, Islamic terrorist attacks “mass murder attacks,” instead of calling them acts of terrorism.Last February, CNN cited a source inside a National Security Council meeting quoting McMaster as saying that use of the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism” is unhelpful in working with allies to fight terrorism.In May, McMaster spoke on ABC’s This Week about whether Trump would use the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism” in a speech that the president was about to give in Saudi Arabia. “The president will call it whatever he wants to call it,” McMaster said.“But I think it’s important that, whatever we call it, we recognize that [extremists] are not religious people. And, in fact, these enemies of all civilizations, what they want to do is to cloak their criminal behavior under this false idea of some kind of religious war.”Breitbart News unearthed a 2014 speech about the Middle East in which McMaster claimed that Islamic terrorist organizations are “really un-Islamic” and are “really irreligious organizations” who cloak themselves in the “false legitimacy of Islam.”Delivering the keynote address at last April’s Norwich University ROTC Centennial Symposium, McMaster criticized “modern-day barbarians like Daesh and al-Qaeda who cynically use a perverted interpretation of religion to perpetuate ignorance, incite hatred, and commit the most heinous crimes against innocents.”2 – McMaster endorsed a book that advocates Quran-kissing apology ceremonies, and frames jihad as largely peaceful.Breitbart News reported that McMaster endorsed and touted a book that frames jihad as a largely peaceful “means to struggle or exert effort,” such as waking up early in the morning to recite prayers. It argues that groups like al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations have hijacked the concept of jihad to wage warfare using such tactics as suicide bombings.That same book calls Hamas an “Islamist political group” while failing to categorize the deadly organization as a terrorist group and refers to al-Qaeda attacks and anti-Israel terrorism as “resistance.”One section of the book calls on the U.S. military to respond to any “desecrations” of the Quran by service members with an apology ceremony, and advocates kissing a new copy of the Quran before presenting the Islamic text to the local Muslim public.The book’s author further demanded that any American soldier who “desecrates” the Quran be ejected from the foreign country of deployment, relieved of duty and turned over to a military judge for “punishment.”“Desecration” of the Quran, according to the McMaster-endorsed book, includes such acts as “letting the Quran fall to the ground during a search, or more blatant instances.”3 – McMaster worked at a think tank backed by George Soros-funded group that helped Obama sell the Iran nuclear deal.From September 2006 to February 2017, McMaster is listed as a member of International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), where he served as consulting senior fellow.  The IISS describes itself as a “world-leading authority on global security, political risk and military conflict.”It is more than that. IISS is financed by a controversial, George Soros-funded group identified by the Obama White House as central in helping to sell the Iran nuclear deal to the public and news media.The IISS has been supportive of the Obama administration-brokered 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, and the group has repeatedly hit back against charges that Tehran has violated the agreement. McMaster himself has been accused of purging the National Security Council of hardliners on Iran.AN IISS donor is the Ploughshares Fund, a grantmaking group identified by the Obama White House as central in helping to market the Iran nuclear deal to the news media.Ploughshares Fund is financed by Soros’ Open Society Institute.The involvement of Ploughshares in selling the Iran agreement to the public was revealed in an extensive New York Times Magazine profile of Obama’s former deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, titled, “The Aspiring Novelist Who Became Obama’s Foreign-Policy Guru.” The article contains interviews with Rhodes and scores of top Obama administration officials.Robert Malley, then a senior director at the National Security Council, expounded on the genesis and execution of the marketing plan to sell the Iran deal.Malley explained to the Times that “experts” were utilized to create an “echo chamber” that disseminated administration claims about Iran to “hundreds of often-clueless reporters” in the news media.Times author David Samuels wrote:In the spring of last year, legions of arms-control experts began popping up at think tanks and on social media, and then became key sources for hundreds of often-clueless reporters. “We created an echo chamber,” he admitted, when I asked him to explain the onslaught of freshly minted experts cheerleading for the deal. “They were saying things that validated what we had given them to say.”Rhodes told Samuels that the marketing strategy took advantage of the “absence of rational discourse” and utilized outside groups, including Ploughshares.When I suggested that all this dark metafictional play seemed a bit removed from rational debate over America’s future role in the world, Rhodes nodded. “In the absence of rational discourse, we are going to discourse the [expletive] out of this,” he said. “We had test drives to know who was going to be able to carry our message effectively, and how to use outside groups like Ploughshares, the Iran Project and whomever else. So we knew the tactics that worked.” He is proud of the way he sold the Iran deal. “We drove them crazy,” he said of the deal’s opponents.Ploughshares says it has awarded hundreds of grants “whose aggregate value exceeded $60 million.”A previous investigation by this reporter showed Ploughshares has partnered with a who’s-who of the radical left, including Code Pink, the pro-Palestinian J Street, United for Peace & Justice, the U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation and Demos, a progressive economic advisory group where Obama’s controversial former green jobs czar, Van Jones, has served on the board.The group says its mission is to support the “smartest minds and most effective organizations to reduce nuclear stockpiles, prevent new nuclear states, and increase global security.”Ploughshares is in turn financed by Soros’s Open Society Institute, the Buffett Foundation, the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund and the Rockefeller Foundation.Another Ploughshares donor is the Tides Foundation, which is one of the largest funders of the radical left. Tides is funded by Soros.Ploughshares has donated to the Institute for Policy Studies, which calls for massive slashes in the U.S. defense budget.It has also financed the International Crisis Group, a small organization that boasts George Soros and his son, Alexander, on its board and where Malley now worksas vice president for public policy.4 – McMaster’s former group scrubbed — then re-added — Soros financing from its website.Soros’s Open Society is also a direct donor to IISS.The IISS re-added Soros’s Open Society Foundations and the Soros-financed Ploughshares group to the list of donors on its website following a request from this reporter on the matter.During a Breitbart News investigation in August, neither the Open Society or Ploughshares were listed on the IISS website page titled “Our Funding” despite this reporter finding literature from those two groups documenting their financing of IISS.Also, both groups were listed in an archived version of the same IISS donor’s page.Following a request for comment, both the Open Society and Ploughshares groups were added back to the IISS donor page.At the time, IISS explained:As well as the Open Society Foundation, we also accidentally removed the Carnegie, McArthur, and James Foundations, as well as a number of governments and corporate supporters, when we updated the page ten days ago. Your question brought this to our attention and the listing has now been corrected.5 – McMaster’s former firm is funded by Sharia-ruled Bahrain — up to 25% of its total income.Besides direct Soros funding, IISS also quietly took in about $32.5 million in funding from Bahrain, a country whose constitution explicitly enshrines Sharia Islamic law as the governing doctrine. The funding from Bahrain, a repressive regime with a dismal human rights track record but also an important regional U.S. ally, reportedly amounted to one quarter of the think tank’s total income.A significant portion of the Bahraini funding reportedly pays for the think tank’s annual conference in Bahrain, the Mamana Dialogue. The original agreementbetween IISS and Bahrain to finance the conference contained a clause calling for the memorandum of understanding to remain confidential, according to the document, which was leaked by a watchdog and published by the Guardian newspaper last year.As a member of IISS, McMaster participated in the Sixth Mamana Dialogue summit in Bahrain from December 11 to December 13, 2009, Breitbart News found. He is listed in IISS literature as being part of the Mamana Dialogue’s four-person panel that year on “military transformation, intelligence and security cooperation.”6 – McMaster served at  a group financed by multinational corporations doing billions in Iran business.As Breitbart News reported, IISS is heavily bankrolled by multinational corporate firms doing billions of dollars in business with Iran.Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html","LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has  demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”Reading Voters’ MindsThe Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.Then a chance meeting bought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”An International EffortJust as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.After the LeakBy early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-russia.html","When the Russia question came up during a hearing at the British Parliament last month, Alexander Nix did not hesitate.“We’ve never worked in Russia,” said Mr. Nix, head of a data consulting firm that advised the Trump campaign on targeting voters.“As far as I’m aware, we’ve never worked for a Russian company,” Mr. Nix added. “We’ve never worked with a Russian organization in Russia or any other country, and we don’t have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”But Mr. Nix’s business did have some dealings with Russian interests, according to company documents and interviews.Mr. Nix is a director of SCL Group, a British political and defense contractor, and chief executive of its American offshoot, Cambridge Analytica, which advised the Trump campaign. The firms’ employees, who often overlap, had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil, the Russian oil giant.Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey. SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature, and SCL also said there were no meetings in London.The contacts took place as Cambridge Analytica was building a roster of Republican political clients in the United States — and harvesting the Facebook profiles of over 50 million users to develop tools it said could analyze voters’ behavior.Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014. It is not clear what — or which client — prompted the line of questioning, which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr. Putin’s popularity to Russian expansionism.On two promotional documents obtained by The New York Times, SCL said it did business in Russia. In both documents, the country is highlighted on world maps that specify the location of SCL clients, with one of the maps noting that the clients were for the firm’s elections division. In a statement, SCL said an employee had done “commercial work” about 25 years ago “for a private company in Russia.”Cambridge Analytica has been a political flash point since its role in the Trump campaign attracted scrutiny after the election. While Mr. Nix’s firm turned over some records to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during its investigation of Russian interference, Democrats on the committee want a fuller review. “It is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to Cambridge Analytica,” they said in a report this month.Asked about the Russian oil company, a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm’s commercial division “discussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty-card customers at gas stations.” The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired.Arash Repac, chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol, offered a different explanation for the talks. He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams.“We needed somebody to guide us with the customer data that we were collecting,” he wrote in response to a question from The Times. “Even though our campaign went ahead, we decided not to cooperate with SCL. No contracts were signed.”But Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company’s voter-profiling technology, said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters.“I remember being super confused,” said Mr. Wylie, who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings.“I kept asking Alexander, ‘Can you explain to me what they want?’” he said, referring to Mr. Nix. “I don’t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America.”“We’re sending them stuff about political targeting — they then come and ask more about political targeting,” Mr. Wylie said, adding that Lukoil “just didn’t seem to be interested” in how the techniques could be used commercially.Mr. Wylie, a former contractor, left SCL before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company. He had a falling out with SCL and tried to set up a rival business. SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company.A second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr. Wylie’s account, but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement.Though Lukoil is not state-owned, it depends on Kremlin support, and its chief executive, Vagit Alekperov, has met with Mr. Putin on a number of occasions. Reuters reported last year that Lukoil and other companies received instructions from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to Russian leadership.Mr. Nix, for his part, has long been adamant. “We just don’t have business in Russia,” he told TechCrunch last year. “We have no involvement in Russia, never have done.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/andrew-mccabe-fbi-memos-trump.html","WASHINGTON — Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director who was fired late Friday, kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with President Trump and his conversations with the former director James B. Comey, a person close to Mr. McCabe said on Saturday.The memos could bolster the account of Mr. Comey, whose own memos and testimony describe repeated requests by Mr. Trump to clear his name. Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump also asked him to shut down a criminal investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Both matters are under investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is considering whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct justice.Mr. McCabe’s memos were left at the F.B.I., which means that Mr. Mueller’s investigators have access to them as they work to corroborate Mr. Comey’s account. Mr. Trump has denied pressuring Mr. Comey to end the Flynn investigation. Mr. Comey was fired last spring, and the revelation of his conversations with Mr. Trump helped lead to the special counsel’s appointment.Mr. McCabe is known to have had at least three meetings with the president. In one, he asked Mr. McCabe how he had voted in the presidential election. In each, he asked about Mr. McCabe’s wife, Jill, who ran a failed campaign as a Democrat for the Virginia State Senate. Mr. McCabe has identified as a lifelong Republican but did not vote in the 2016 presidential race.The existence of his memos was first reported by The Associated Press.Mr. McCabe was fired less than two days before his retirement. Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited what he said was a lack of candor by Mr. McCabe in interviews with internal investigators. His firing had been recommended by career disciplinary officials at the F.B.I.Mr. McCabe immediately declared that his firing was part of a Trump administration effort to discredit him and damage the special counsel’s investigation. In an interview, he said he had not made false statements. “This is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness,” he said.He was among the first F.B.I. officials to scrutinize possible Trump campaign ties to Russia. Mr. Trump has taunted Mr. McCabe both publicly and privately, and Republican allies of the president have cast Mr. McCabe as the center of a “deep state” effort to undermine the Trump presidency.His lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich, said Justice Department officials had rushed to fire Mr. McCabe before he could qualify for his pension. “This distortion of the process begins at the very top, with the president’s repeated offensive, drive-by Twitter attacks on Mr. McCabe,” Mr. Bromwich said late Friday.Mr. Trump kept up his Twitter barrage on Saturday, pointing to hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations to Ms. McCabe’s campaign from a political committee run by Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor and a longtime ally of the Clintons.The president’s personal lawyer seemed to lend credence Saturday to the idea that Mr. McCabe and Mr. Mueller were linked in the eyes of the president. Asked by The Daily Beast for a response to Mr. McCabe’s firing, the lawyer, John Dowd, sent an email saying it was now time that the special counsel investigation be shut down.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/maine-republican-leslie-gibson.html","A Republican candidate for the Maine State House who disparaged two teenage survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., dropped out of the race after drawing heavy criticism and challengers from both political parties.The candidate, Leslie Gibson, had been running to represent District 57 in central Maine unopposed, according to The Sun Journal, which first reported the comments he made on Twitter. Mr. Gibson called one Florida student, Emma González, a “skinhead lesbian,” and another, David Hogg, a “moron” and a “baldfaced liar.”Some state lawmakers, including at least two Republicans, were quick to condemn Mr. Gibson after his comments surfaced. Mr. Hogg issued a call on Twitter for someone to run against Mr. Gibson. By Thursday, two challengers who had been dismayed by the remarks were scrambling to complete the paperwork needed to run for the seat before the filing deadline that night.By Friday, at least one Democrat, Eryn Gilchrist, and one Republican, Thomas H. Martin Jr., had entered the race and Mr. Gibson had withdrawn.Mr. Gibson could not be reached on Saturday and appeared to have deleted the personal Twitter account on which he made the remarks. But screenshots confirmed that a person with a Twitter handle bearing his name posted the disparaging tweets. Other screenshots of tweets from a locked account that appear to have been for Mr. Gibson’s campaign contained an apology.In the apologetic tweets, which were quoted by The Press Herald, Mr. Gibson acknowledged that his responses were “harsh and uncivil” and said it was “inappropriate to single out” the students.Mr. Martin, who served as a state senator in another district in 2011 and 2012 before losing a re-election bid, said he had considered running for office again but had not planned to do it so soon because he and his wife had just moved to the area and had adopted a baby boy.Still, he said that after Mr. Gibson’s comments, he got calls from friends urging him to run and decided that he “couldn’t sit idle and let our state be reflected so negatively.”The comments “gave the state a black eye,” Mr. Martin said.“They weren’t the true feelings of the state or the Republican Party — or any party — I have to believe,” he said, adding that he planned to contact the Parkland students and commend their courage.A spokesman for the Maine Republican Party did not return an email requesting comment on Saturday.In a statement from the Maine Democratic Party, Ms. Gilchrist said she had not considered running for office before she read Mr. Gibson’s comments. After she did, she said, she thought constituents in the district “deserved a representative who will respect people and try to work through their differences to make our lives better.”In the wake of the shooting last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which killed 17 people, Ms. González, 18, and Mr. Hogg, 17, emerged as two of the most forceful student activists agitating for gun control.Mr. Hogg’s early remark that “we’re children” while politicians “are the adults” won him praise. Ms. González’s speech soon after made the phrase “We call B.S.” a rallying cry among young people. Since then, the Parkland students’ ability to leverage social media to command the narrative and keep gun control in the news has been widely recognized.Ms. González did not return a phone message on Saturday night and did not appear to have responded to Mr. Gibson on Twitter directly. She did share a tweet from one of her fellow students who said Mr. Gibson’s decision to drop out of the race was “what he deserves.”Mr. Hogg said his mother had seen a story about what Mr. Gibson had called Ms. González and he had quickly sent the tweet asking someone to challenge Mr. Gibson.“If you’re the type of person who calls children who are a witness to murder a skinhead lesbian and baldfaced liar, that kind of speaks for itself,” he said on Saturday. “It’s disgusting, but honestly, I’m a super petty person, and we all cheered when he said that he dropped out.“We need good people in office — people who are actually human and have an ounce of empathy,” he continued. “It’s hilarious because its ridiculous. They’re only proving our point that there are so many bad politicians out there. We almost let somebody that would say something like that win and run unopposed.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/trump-mueller.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump on Sunday morning escalated a weekend-long barrage against those who have been investigating him and his campaign, extending his attacks to include the team of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, whom he had largely sought to avoid alienating in recent months.Mr. Trump assailed James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired last year in what he said at the time was a reflection of his frustration with the Russia investigation, and Andrew G. McCabe, Mr. Comey’s deputy, who was fired on Friday night, barely a day before his scheduled retirement, by Attorney General Jeff Sessions after public pressure from the president.While those two have been regular targets, the president extended his complaints to Mr. Mueller, who was appointed after Mr. Comey’s firing to investigate Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election and any connection to Mr. Trump and his campaign. That was notable because for the most part, Mr. Trump has heeded the advice of his lawyers not to target Mr. Mueller’s team directly.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!”The president’s attacks, which Mr. McCabe on Friday characterized as a “war on the F.B.I.,” have gone too far for some Republicans. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida on Sunday criticized the decision to fire Mr. McCabe on a Friday night shortly before his retirement took effect, jeopardizing his pension.“I don’t like the way it happened,” Mr. Rubio said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “He should’ve been allowed to finish through the weekend.” Speaking of the president, he added: “Obviously he doesn’t like McCabe and he’s made that pretty clear now for over a year. We need to be very careful about taking these very important entities and smearing everybody in them with a broad stroke.”The attack on Mr. Mueller, a longtime Republican who was appointed F.B.I. director under a Republican president, George W. Bush, followed a statement by Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer published Saturday calling on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Together, the comments raised the question once again about whether the president might be seeking to lay the ground to try to fire Mr. Mueller.The shift in tone comes just days after The New York Times reported that Mr. Mueller has subpoenaed records from the Trump Organization. Mr. Trump’s lawyers met with Mr. Mueller’s team last week and received more details about how the special counsel is approaching the investigation, including the scope of his interest in the Trump Organization specifically.A president cannot directly fire a special counsel but instead can order his attorney general to do so, and even then has to give a cause like conflict of interest. Since Mr. Sessions, a former campaign adviser, has recused himself from the Russia investigation, to Mr. Trump’s continuing aggravation, the job would then fall to the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein.But Mr. Rosenstein has said as recently as last week that he sees no justification for firing Mr. Mueller, meaning that he would either have to change his mind or be removed himself. The third-ranking official at the Justice Department, Rachel Brand, decided last month to step down. The next official in line would be the solicitor general, Noel Francisco, a former White House and Justice Department lawyer under Mr. Bush.Mr. Trump sought to have Mr. Mueller fired last June but backed down after his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to quit. The president told The Times a month later that Mr. Mueller would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family’s finances beyond any relationship with Russia. The White House made no assertion last week that the subpoena to the Trump Organization crossed that red line, but Mr. Trump evidently has grown tired of the strategy of being respectful and deferential to the special counsel.John Dowd, the president’s private lawyer, signaled the shift in approach in a statement given to The Daily Beast. “I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the F.B.I. Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt dossier,” Mr. Dowd said.When Mr. Mueller assembled his team, he surrounded himself with subject-matter experts and trusted former colleagues. As the team filled out, Republican allies of Mr. Trump noted that some high-profile members had previously donated money to Democratic political candidates. In particular, Republicans have seized on donations by Andrew Weissmann, who served as F.B.I. general counsel under Mr. Mueller, as an example of bias. Mr. Weissmann is a career prosecutor but, while in private law practice, he donated thousands of dollars toward President Barack Obama’s election effort.In his Sunday morning Twitter blasts, Mr. Trump also renewed his attacks on Mr. Comey and Mr. McCabe, who like Mr. Mueller are also longtime Republicans.“Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked ‘have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?’” Mr. Trump wrote. “He said strongly “never, no.” He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.”He went on to dismiss reports that Mr. McCabe kept detailed memos of his time as deputy F.B.I. director under Mr. Trump, just as Mr. Comey did. Mr. McCabe left those memos with the F.B.I., which means that Mr. Mueller’s team has access to them.“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Mr. Trump, who admitted last week that he made up a claim in a meeting with Canada’s prime minister and is considered honest by only a third of the American people in polls, stayed this weekend at the White House, where he evidently is spending time watching Fox News and stewing about the investigation.The Republican majority on the House Intelligence Committee has concluded that there was no systematic collusion between Russia and Mr. Trump’s campaign and shut down its investigation, a decision that the Democrats on the panel objected to. The Senate Intelligence Committee is still actively investigating even as Mr. Mueller’s team is.Mr. Mueller has established that Russia tried to interfere in the election to benefit Mr. Trump and indicted three Russian organizations and 13 Russian individuals in the effort, although the indictment included no allegation that the president’s campaign was involved. Mr. Trump’s administration last week sanctioned those organizations and individuals.Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last May, at first attributing the decision to the F.B.I. director’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server but later telling an interviewer that he had the Russia investigation in mind when he made the decision. Mr. McCabe, who backed Mr. Comey, was fired on Friday after being accused of not being candid with an inspector general about whether he authorized department officials to talk with reporters about the Clinton inquiry in 2016.The president has repeatedly argued that Mr. McCabe was tainted because his wife ran for the Virginia State Senate as a Democrat in 2015 and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from an organization controlled by Terry McAuliffe, then the governor and a longtime friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton. Jill McCabe lost the race, and Mr. Trump reportedly told Mr. McCabe that she was a “loser.”Mr. McCabe has characterized his firing as an attempt to impede Mr. Mueller’s investigation, which beyond collusion is also focused on whether the president has attempted to obstruct justice by firing Mr. Comey. “This is part of an effort to discredit me as a witness,” Mr. McCabe said on Friday.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/nancy-pelosi-democrats-candidates.html","WASHINGTON — A few hours after Conor Lamb, the Pennsylvania Democrat, claimed victory in a House race with a vow to oppose his party’s leader, Nancy Pelosi, the once-and-perhaps-future speaker was explaining to a group of female congressional candidates why she did not retire after 2016.She intended to do so after Hillary Clinton won, Ms. Pelosi recalled Wednesday at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reception here. But she stayed to ensure Washington had at least one woman in power.To some lawmakers in the room who described her remarks, the message was clear: Ms. Pelosi is not going anywhere — a point she underscored in an interview.Yet her resolve is at odds with growing numbers of Democratic candidates who view her as politically toxic and are pledging to vote against her as their leader, as Mr. Lamb did without suffering consequences with voters and donors. These candidates and some current House Democrats — tired of years of attack ads invoking Ms. Pelosi as a “San Francisco liberal,” and impatient to see a younger set of leaders take power — are now openly distancing themselves from Ms. Pelosi or declaring outright that it is time for her to go.Mr. Lamb, by coming out early against Ms. Pelosi and scoring an upset win in a district President Trump carried by nearly 20 percentage points, has clearly emboldened some other Democrats to follow suit and disavow her. Republicans intend to make Ms. Pelosi’s unpopularity a centerpiece of their 2018 strategy, hoping that her polarizing status will mitigate their predicted losses.Anticipating this strategy from the right, Democratic candidates are increasingly opposing her as speaker or refusing to take a stand an act of political inoculation — a trend that even her allies acknowledge could ultimately imperil her grip on the Democratic caucus.At least two other senior Democrats, Representatives Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and Joseph Crowley of New York, are already actively laying the groundwork to seek the leader’s job if Ms. Pelosi’s position becomes untenable.As Democratic House candidates descended on Washington last week for a round of training and fund-raising, the topic of how to confront the Pelosi question came up repeatedly, according to multiple officials.“I was just in D.C. and that’s the advice everybody gives: Don’t say you’re for Pelosi,” recalled former Representative Brad Ashford, a Nebraska Democrat trying to reclaim his seat. (He would not rule out backing Ms. Pelosi.)Most ominous for Ms. Pelosi, it is not just centrist candidates running in red-tinged districts who are reluctant to embrace her, but also political insurgents on the left who see her as an embodiment of the Washington establishment.“I would have to see who’s running,” said Marie Newman, a progressive Democratic House candidate in Illinois, when asked if she would support Ms. Pelosi for speaker. Ms. Newman is vying to unseat Representative Daniel Lipinski, a conservative Chicago Democrat, in a primary there on Tuesday.And on Capitol Hill, Ms. Pelosi, 77, must contend with colleagues from her own generation who want their turn in charge, as well as younger Democrats who’d prefer to clear out the party’s entire septuagenarian leadership team: beyond Ms. Pelosi, the other two ranking House Democrats, Mr. Hoyer and James E. Clyburn, are 78 and 77.Yet at a time when women are at the forefront of the opposition to Mr. Trump’s presidency — volunteering, donating and running for office in record numbers — the specter of Democrats taking back the House only to unceremoniously dump the most powerful woman in American politics strikes many in the party as outrageous.And Ms. Pelosi herself is plainly in this camp.“I’m a woman at the table,” she said in the interview Friday before getting on a plane for Houston, where she was going to raise money for House Democrats at the annual rodeo there.Demonstrating the swagger that delights her admirers and prompts eye-rolling from detractors, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats needed her in charge.“I am a master legislator, I am a shrewd politician and I have a following in the country that, apart from a presidential candidate, nobody else can claim,” she said.While she would not firmly commit to seeking the speakership again, it is clearly her plan, and she even gave voice to a concern on the minds of many Democrats: the chaotic scramble that would ensue if she steps down.“If I was to walk away now, this caucus would be in such a musical chairs scenario,” she said.Even as energy on the left has soared across the country thanks to Mr. Trump, tensions among House Democrats are brewing inside the Capitol. Should Democrats fail to reclaim the House in a year with so many factors in their favor, Ms. Pelosi and her long-serving lieutenants will almost certainly be pushed to step down.Yet some in the caucus want to see new leadership no matter what. Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, hosted Mr. Crowley at a St. Patrick’s Day-themed event last week and unexpectedly announced that he would back Mr. Crowley for leader. Mr. Pascrell, 81, said the culture of the House was changing.“A lot of new people will be coming in and I think we should start fresh,” Mr. Pascrell said, adding almost apologetically of Ms. Pelosi: “She’s taken a lot of crap from Republicans and Democrats and she’s really been above it all.”Representative Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat, said he had also encouraged Mr. Crowley to run for speaker.“Having Joe be the leader of this party next session would be a welcome change,” said Mr. Vela, 55, adding that Ms. Pelosi “hurts our candidates” in competitive districts.For his part, Mr. Crowley has been inviting groups of younger lawmakers to meet for coffee and pastries in his office, reaching out to high-profile newer members like Joaquin Castro of Texas and Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts.In an interview, Mr. Crowley declined to rule out taking on Ms. Pelosi. Asked if he was seeking commitments for a future race, Mr. Crowley said only that “I have been talking to my colleagues about what they and we can do to help put us in the majority.”Ms. Pelosi dismissed the idea of a challenge from Mr. Crowley, who briefly considered challenging her after the 2016 election, and her aides pointedly noted that at an event in New York last week, he introduced her as “soon to be speaker again.”Mr. Hoyer, in turn, has pitched himself to colleagues as a transitional House speaker, according to multiple lawmakers who have spoken with him — a steady hand through the 2020 elections, and perhaps no further. Katie Grant, his spokeswoman, said he was “focused on taking back the House.”Part of Ms. Pelosi’s challenge owes to the changing nature of fund-raising: Mr. Lamb raised over $4 million from mostly online contributors, the same way other Democrats are attracting donations. That has raised questions about just how much Ms. Pelosi’s vaunted fund-raising prowess still matters.“It weakens the leverage of party leaders,” Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who challenged Ms. Pelosi after the 2016 elections, said of the new fund-raising tools.Yet some Democrats predicted that if the party rides an electoral wave back to power, Ms. Pelosi would reap much of the credit.“If we take the majority, I completely assume that Leader Pelosi will be Speaker Pelosi,” said Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California.The most plausible scenario for Ms. Pelosi to exit, Democrats believe, is one in which the party just barely wins control of the House. A number of new lawmakers would have pledged not to vote for her, and several Democrats oppose her as a matter of routine, potentially denying her the 218 votes needed to secure the speakership.“I think it will be left up to the new membership,” said Representative John Lewis of Georgia, noting that freshman lawmakers and the rest of the caucus should “work their will.” That could doom Ms. Pelosi, especially if more Democrats follow Mr. Lamb’s approach.At least three of the Democrats’ “red to blue” candidates — recruits designated as top priorities by the D.C.C.C. — have signaled they would prefer a leader other than Ms. Pelosi. In Minnesota, Dean Phillips, a wealthy businessman challenging Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican, has called for a “new generation of leadership.” In Washington State, Lisa Brown, a former state senator who is challenging Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the Republican leadership, said “there’s room for new blood in all the caucuses in Congress.”And Paul Davis, who is running for an open seat in Kansas, is flatly opposed to Ms. Pelosi. He said a change was “badly needed” and lamented leaders who are “toxic in this part of the country.”But there is unease with Ms. Pelosi in solid-blue districts, too. In two Boston-area districts, neither the Democratic incumbents nor their more progressive rivals have committed to backing Ms. Pelosi. Brianna Wu, a liberal activist opposing Representative Stephen F. Lynch in a Democratic primary, said she was worried Democrats would suffer from Ms. Pelosi’s “inability to express a vision for the party.”Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a moderate Democrat, said he had encouraged other congressional hopefuls to oppose Ms. Pelosi if necessary.“I have liberals back home, the one thing they really like about me is the fact that I voted against Nancy,” he said. “No matter what candidate you are, it’s not necessarily a bad message.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/obituaries/adrian-lamo-dead.html","Adrian Lamo, a hacker best known for breaking into the computer networks of The New York Times and other major corporations, and for reporting the Army whistle-blower Chelsea Manning to the authorities, was found dead on Wednesday in Wichita, Kan. He was 37.Mr. Lamo’s body was discovered in an apartment in the city, The Wichita Eagle reported. His father announced the death in a post on Facebook on Friday. Kate Flavin, a spokeswoman for Sedgwick County, Kan., said on Saturday that the cause of death was unknown.Mr. Lamo was 22 when federal prosecutors accused him of breaking into The Times’s computer network, creating fake usernames and running up over $300,000 in data research fees. Mr. Lamo also gained access to the computer networks of Yahoo, Microsoft and Cingular Wireless, prosecutors said.“It’s like someone kicking in your front door while you’re on vacation and running up a $300,000 bill on your phone, and then telling you when you arrive home that he had performed a useful service by demonstrating that your deadbolt wasn’t secure enough,” James B. Comey, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in 2003, referring to Mr. Lamo’s activities.Mr. Lamo pleaded guilty to one count of computer damage, telling a federal judge that he was “genuinely remorseful” for his actions. He was sentenced to house arrest and probation.Mr. Lamo was never a “malicious hacker,” his father, Mario Lamo, said in a message, adding, “Everything that he did was out of curiosity.” The younger Mr. Lamo told Wired magazine in 2010 that he had Asperger’s syndrome.In 2010, Ms. Manning, an Army private, contacted Mr. Lamo via instant message. They chatted for a week about her personal problems in the military. Ms. Manning admitted that she had leaked classified video of a helicopter attack in Baghdad that left 12 people dead, including two Reuters employees, to WikiLeaks.org, which published the video online under the title “Collateral Murder.”Mr. Lamo said Ms. Manning had also admitted leaking to WikiLeaks 260,000 classified diplomatic cables and video of a 2009 Afghanistan airstrike that left 96 people dead.“He was just grabbing information from where he could get it and trying to leak it,” Mr. Lamo told The  Times in 2010 about Ms. Manning, a transgender woman who was then known as Bradley Manning.Mr. Lamo called the F.B.I. and relayed Ms. Manning’s admissions. She was arrested and eventually sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking over 750,000 documents and video, the longest punishment ever imposed for a leak conviction. President Barack Obama commuted Ms. Manning’s sentence in January 2017, and she recently filed to run for the United States Senate in Maryland.Mr. Lamo said he was worried that the leaks provided by Ms. Manning would endanger people’s lives.“I thought to myself, ‘What if somebody dies because this information is leaked?’” he said in 2010.WikiLeaks and others condemned Mr. Lamo for turning Ms. Manning in to the federal authorities.Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, called Mr. Lamo a “serial F.B.I. snitch” on Twitter. On the comments of the Facebook post announcing Mr. Lamo’s death, some called him a “real hero” and “true patriot.”Mario Lamo said his son went through a difficult period after reporting Ms. Manning to the authorities.“He was vilified by many people by his position about the Manning affair,” he said. “I was with him when this happened and understood that he lived by some principles and he stood for them.”In addition to his father, Mr. Lamo is survived by his mother, Mary Atwood, and two siblings.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/umbc-basketball.html","BALTIMORE — The stunning victory by the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, over the University of Virginia on Friday night — the biggest upset ever in the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament — catapulted a school whose competitive claim to fame had long been chess into sports history.But the U.M.B.C. Cinderella story transcends athletics, and has been decades in the making.The university, founded in 1966, is better known for producing the most African-American students who go on to complete combined M.D.-Ph.D. programs than it is for turning out professional athletes. Before its 20-point win over the nation’s top-ranked basketball team, it was the reigning National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition champion. A statue of the school’s mascot, a Chesapeake Bay retriever named True Grit, has a shiny nose from the tradition of students’ rubbing it for good luck before finals, rather than before big games.U.M.B.C., which has about 14,000 students and is situated about a 10-minute drive from downtown Baltimore, has come to embrace its underdog status in Maryland’s public university system. It is among the newer of the system’s 12 institutions, and it has worked to overcome a reputation as a commuter school without a football team.After last night’s victory, the U.M.B.C. athletic department took a jab at the system’s flagship school, the University of Maryland, College Park, which had a blowout victory over the Retrievers earlier in the season but failed to make the N.C.A.A. tournament. U.M.B.C. retweeted a photo of a Maryland fan holding a sign at that December game saying that U.M.B.C. stood for “University of Maryland Backup College.”“Hopefully you enjoyed our game from your couch dude!” the tweet said.Over the years, U.M.B.C. has quietly carved out an identity of its own, in part shaped by national rankings listing it as “up and coming” and one of the “most innovative” universities.“When I think about who we are as an institution and what happened last night, it represents what we tell our students: If you work hard, there can be these special moments where you’re moving toward greatness,” said the university’s president, Freeman A. Hrabowski III.“The symbolism of last night is that my young men went out there to be the best that they can be, and believed in themselves, against all odds,” he added from his hotel room in Charlotte, N.C. “There’s such symbolism in that, for our families, for people from the working and middle class, for America.”In athletics or in academics, it’s not often that Dr. Hrabowski, a mathematician and professed “mega-nerd,” thinks something is impossible.Dr. Hrabowski, who has led the institution for 26 years, was born in Birmingham, Ala., at the start of the civil rights movement, and grew up in the same segregated neighborhood as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. He spent five days in jail at age 12 for participating in a civil rights protest. He obtained his undergraduate degree, from Hampton University, at 19, and his doctorate, from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, at 24.His efforts have helped drive U.M.B.C.’s acclaimed Meyerhoff Scholars Program to the forefront of the push to increase diversity in science, technology, engineering and related fields, and the program has been replicated across the country. Dr. Hrabowski said he was most proud that it had been able to flourish over the years at a predominantly white institution.“The reason we do well with minorities is because we do so well with everybody else,” he said.Dr. Hrabowski has helped build the university, which was founded on farmland and initially educated 750 students, to include three huge research centers funded by NASA, a $170 million humanities building and a $140 million interdisciplinary building that is under construction.He calls it “a middle-class campus,” but one that looks like the “plaza of nations at the U.N.,” representing the school’s motto of “inclusive excellence.” More than the win last night, Dr. Hrabowski said he was proud of what else was on display: a diverse group in the stands, in the band, on the dance team.“You saw in the U.M.B.C. community what America wants to be,” he said.U.M.B.C. sends 40 percent of its students to graduate programs, including Harvard and Stanford. Its graduates include high-profile researchers at Johns Hopkins and college presidents. It is a leading feeder to the National Security Agency and Northrop Grumman.“It’s a campus where you come because you want to be a serious student, no matter your background, across disciplines,” he said. (Two of the school’s basketball players have 4.0 G.P.A.s.)The school’s balance of athletics and academics is perhaps its most valuable asset, said Kafui Dzirasa, who obtained a degree in chemical engineering from U.M.B.C. in 2001 and is now a physician scientist running a brain science research lab at Duke University.Dr. Dzirasa was a conference champion in the long jump, but was also an academic All-American. “It was always this idea that you could do two things at once, and you could do two things with excellence,” said Dr. Dzirasa, who obtained his graduate degrees from Duke. “I’ve always taken pride in the university doing well in everything it touches.”Dr. Hrabowski said that Friday night’s victory sent a message to higher education institutions across the country.It was not lost on him that Virginia is one of the oldest public universities in the country; has a legacy that stretches back to one of the nation’s founders; and has $9 billion more in endowment money than U.M.B.C., which is trying to raise its first $100 million.“Public universities can be strong academically, even if they don’t have hundreds of years and a major budget,” he said. “We’ve got to help the public understand that institutions of all types have to have quality.”After spending five years on U.S. News and World Report’s “up and coming” list, a category that has been discontinued, U.M.B.C. has a running joke about when it will be able to say it has arrived. Dr. Hrabowski wonders if the basketball team’s newfound fame will be it.“I guess we don’t ever want to arrive,” Dr. Hrabowski said. “Because once you think you’ve really arrived, you start going the opposite way.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/business/trump-organization-russia-mueller.html","The investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election has expanded to include President Trump’s family business, with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, subpoenaing the Trump Organization for documents related to Russia.For more than 30 years, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to conduct business in Russia. He traveled to Moscow in 1987 to explore building a hotel. He applied for his trademark in the country as early as 1996. And his children and associates have met with Russian developers and government officials on multiple occasions in search of joint ventures.But the company says nothing has come of it. Mr. Trump tweeted in January last year, shortly before his inauguration: “I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA — NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!”So what about the Trump Organization’s Russian connections might be of interest to Mr. Mueller?There Was a Moscow Hotel Deal in the Works During the CampaignPerhaps the closest Mr. Trump came to launching a real estate project in Russia was during the presidential campaign, when he signed a letter of intent in late 2015 for a Trump hotel to be built in Moscow. Ultimately, the deal never materialized.In email exchanges with Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, Felix Sater, a Russian émigré who had previously helped develop Trump SoHo in New York, talked about securing financing for the Moscow project from VTB, a major state-owned Russian bank under American sanctions. He also mused about how the deal, if supported by Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, would “fix relations between the countries by showing everyone that commerce & business are much better and more practical than politics.”“I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,” Mr. Sater wrote in one of the emails.Mr. Trump signed the letter of intent with Andrey Rozov, a developer of retail and residential projects in the Moscow region. If the deal went through, Mr. Trump would receive a $4 million upfront fee in exchange for licensing his name, and his company would manage the completed hotel.By January 2016, the project seemed to have stalled. At one point, without success, Mr. Cohen emailed an aide to Mr. Putin seeking help jump-starting it. There is no evidence the Kremlin provided any assistance for the project.The Trump Organization has said that it received no government approvals or financing and that the effort was abandoned in early 2016.Mr. Trump Took Miss Universe to Moscow and ‘Met the Top People’Mr. Trump’s business opportunities in Russia got little traction until he took the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013.A father-son pair of real estate developers, Aras and Emin Agalarov, paid nearly $20 million to license the Miss Universe name, bringing the contest to their Crocus City Hall in Moscow. As an owner of the pageant, Mr. Trump flew to Russia in November 2013 to participate. He became friendly with his partners, who were known to have been helpful to the Kremlin.The visit left an impression on Mr. Trump and had him contemplating future endeavors with the Agalarovs.“I had a great weekend with you and your family,” Mr. Trump posted on Twitter in a message to Aras Agalarov. “You have done a FANTASTIC job. TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next,” he wrote, before referring to Mr. Agalarov’s son, a pop star: “EMIN was WOW!”While the plans for the tower were apparently shelved during the campaign, Mr. Trump and the Agalarovs maintained their friendship.In June 2016, a publicist for Emin Agalarov requested that Donald Trump Jr. meet with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. That meeting, at Trump Tower in New York, first reported by The New York Times last July, included other campaign officials and has been the subject of considerable scrutiny.After the disclosure of the meeting, the president downplayed his ties to the Agalarovs in an interview with The Times. But in a September 2015 interview on “The Hugh Hewitt Show,” he had made the Miss Universe pageant seem far more important.“I called it my weekend in Moscow,” Mr. Trump said. “I was with the top-level people, both oligarchs and generals, and top-of-the-government people. I can’t go further than that, but I will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was extraordinary.”The Trumps’ German Bank Paid Fines in a Russian Money-Laundering CaseTwo decades ago, Mr. Trump was a persona non grata on Wall Street. His casino and hotel businesses had suffered some bankruptcies, and his lenders were grumbling that he had stiffed them.But one giant German bank stepped up as a willing partner.Over the years, that institution, Deutsche Bank, offered Mr. Trump more than $4 billion in loan commitments and potential bond offerings, a majority of which were completed, The Times reported last year.There is no indication of a Russian connection to Mr. Trump’s loans or accounts at Deutsche Bank, and there is no public evidence that Mr. Mueller has subpoenaed the bank for records about Mr. Trump.But the bank last year landed in legal trouble over Russian money laundering — paying more than $600 million in penalties to American and British regulators.Some Deutsche Bank executives expect they will eventually have to produce records as part of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, The Times  reported last July. The bank has already been asked to turn over documents to federal prosecutors in Brooklyn about another client with a White House connection: the Kushner Companies, the family business of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and adviser.A Russian Oligarch Bought a Trump Mansion at a High PriceDmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian billionaire oligarch, paid $95 million for Mr. Trump’s oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., one of two sources of income from Russians that Mr. Trump’s lawyers have said were reflected in his income tax returns. (The other was $12.2 million in payments in connection with holding the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.)The Palm Beach deal was unusual for several reasons.Mr. Trump sold the house less than four years after buying it for about $41 million. Mr. Rybolovlev paid the markup despite buying the property in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis. And Mr. Trump had made few improvements to the mansion, which reportedly had a mold problem.Mr. Rybolovlev, moreover, never lived in the property.At the time of the sale, Mr. Trump was facing financial pressure. He potentially owed Deutsche Bank $40 million after not paying off a loan for his Chicago hotel and tower.The Florida property later featured prominently in Mr. Rybolovlev’s divorce.Mr. Rybolovlev’s wife sought control of the mansion, saying he had bought it partly to hide money from her in the divorce, a claim he denied.He has since demolished the mansion and divided the property into different parcels that he is selling. The new owners are hidden behind murky layers of trusts and other legal entities.There Were Boasts That Russian Money Helped Pay for Golf Courses and Other ProjectsIn the past decade, the Trump Organization has bought and refurbished several golf courses around the world, but the financing behind those deals remains something of a mystery. A respected golf writer says that Eric Trump, a son of Mr. Trump’s who is now helping to run the Trump Organization, told him the money came from Russia.Last year, during an interview on Boston public radio, the golf journalist James Dodson recounted a conversation he had had with Eric Trump in 2013 on a newly opened Trump golf course in Charlotte, N.C. Mr. Dodson said he had asked Mr. Trump about the company’s sources of funds, and Mr. Trump told him, “We have pretty much all the money we need from investors in Russia.”Eric Trump has denied making the comment about Russia, but several of Mr. Dodson’s friends and colleagues confirmed that Mr. Dodson relayed the anecdote to them shortly after the conversation took place.It was not the first time that one of Mr. Trump’s sons made a similar claim. In 2008, at a real estate conference in New York, Donald Trump Jr. said: “In terms of high-end product influx into the U.S., Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets, say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/trump-truth-lies.html","WASHINGTON — When President Trump told donors at a fund-raiser this past week that he had invented a fact during a conversation with Canada’s prime minister, the surprise was not that America’s leader makes things up, but that he openly admitted it.Or maybe admitted is the wrong word. He actually seemed to boast about it.In the furor that followed the disclosure of his remarks, attention focused on the impact on relations with Canada and whether the president was right or wrong in his assertion about trade. But the episode goes to the heart of a more fundamental debate about Mr. Trump: When does he know the things he says are false, and when is he simply misinformed?Mr. Trump, after all, has made so many claims that stretch the bounds of accuracy that full-time fact-checkers struggle to keep up. Most Americans long ago concluded that he is dishonest, according to polls. While most presidents lie at times, Mr. Trump’s speeches and Twitter posts are embedded with so many false, distorted, misleading or unsubstantiated claims that he has tested even the normally low standards of American politics.“His statement this week was another reminder of how cavalier he is with the truth,” said Bill Adair, the founder of PolitiFact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning, nonpartisan fact-checking website owned by the Poynter Institute. “He seems so willing to say whatever suits him at that moment regardless of whether it’s true. In all the time that I was editor of PolitiFact and in the time since when I’ve worked with fact-checkers all over the world, I’ve just never seen any political figure distort the truth so recklessly.”Mr. Trump’s presidency has been marked from the start with false or misleading statements, such as his outlandish claims that more people came to his inauguration than any before and that at least three million unauthorized immigrants voted illegally against him, costing him the popular vote. He has gone on to assert that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, a claim that his own Justice Department refuted, and that he would not benefit from his tax-cutting plan.The lack of fidelity to facts has real-world consequences in both foreign affairs and domestic policymaking. Foreign diplomats and lawmakers of both parties say they do not assume anything he says is necessarily true. In a White House where one aide described the existence of “alternative facts” and another acknowledged telling “white lies,” staff members scramble to defend his claims without putting their own credibility on the line. News organizations debate when to use the word “lie” because it implies intent.Since Mr. Trump became a presidential candidate, PolitiFact has evaluated more than 500 assertions and found 69 percent of them mostly false, false or “pants on fire” false. By comparison, it judged 26 percent of the statements by Mr. Obama that it evaluated as false and the same percentage for those by Hillary Clinton.These are not scientific measurements, of course, because the selection of statements for examination is inherently subjective and focused on those that seem questionable, rather than a gauge of all public comments. Mr. Trump’s defenders say fact-checking organizations like PolitiFact are politically biased, which Mr. Adair and his counterparts adamantly deny. But even among Republicans examined by PolitiFact, Mr. Trump is an outlier.While PolitiFact did not exist during most of President George W. Bush’s tenure, it has found that 42 percent of statements that it examined by Senator John McCain of Arizona and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, the two previous Republican presidential nominees, were false. The party’s congressional leaders, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, judged on far fewer statements, were both at similar levels, 43 percent and 41 percent.The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Friday. Mr. Trump’s supporters rarely defend him as a truth teller, but argue that all presidents lie and point to false statements made by his predecessors, like Bill Clinton (Monica Lewinsky), Mr. Bush (Iraq) and Mr. Obama (health care).Advisers say privately that Mr. Trump may not always be precise but is speaking a larger truth that many Americans understand. Flyspecking, tut-tutting critics in the news media, they say, fail to grasp the connection he has with a section of the country that feels profoundly misled by a self-serving establishment. To them, the particular facts do not matter as much as this deeper truth.“I think presidents, all of them, actually have a habit of thinking that they’re right, whether they’re right or not,” said Patrick H. Caddell, a political consultant who shared research with Mr. Trump’s 2016 campaign. “He’s more guilty of that than some sort of preplanned and mendacious statements.”But Mr. Caddell, a strategist for Jimmy Carter when he was beaten up by the media as naïve for promising never to tell a lie, said Americans see Mr. Trump in context. “In Washington, D.C., facts don’t matter; people have narratives, including the media, and they just ignore anything that doesn’t fit that,” he said. “Why should the American people punish him when they think the entire political culture” is that way?Mr. Trump’s reported conversation with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada occurred during a St. Louis fund-raiser on Wednesday for Josh Hawley, a Republican Senate candidate in Missouri. Reporters were not permitted in the room, but an audio recording was later obtained by The Washington Post.As Mr. Trump told the story, the Canadian leader assured him that the United States did not have a trade deficit with Canada.“I said, ‘Wrong, Justin, you do,’” Mr. Trump said, according to a transcript published by The Post. “I didn’t even know. Josh, I had no idea. I just said, ‘You’re wrong.’ You know why? Because we’re so stupid. And I thought they were smart. I said, ‘You’re wrong, Justin.’ He said, ‘Nope, we have no trade deficit.’”The president also asserted that Japan bars American cars from its market through an odd test. “They take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car,” he said. “And if the hood dents, then the car doesn’t qualify.”At a briefing the next day, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, acknowledged that the bowling ball anecdote was false. “Obviously, he’s joking about this particular test,” she said, “but it illustrates the creative ways some countries are able to keep American goods out of their markets.”And even though the United States trade representative’s office says the United States had a $12.5 billion trade surplus with Canada in 2016, she asserted that Mr. Trump was actually right because he was including items not included by the government agency. “Once you include those, it shows that there actually is a deficit,” she said. She later said on Twitter that the president was referring only to trade in goods, not trade in both goods and services, the common measurement.But the point was that Mr. Trump acknowledged to the donors that he made the claim having no idea whether it was right or wrong. And it was not even the only time that day he made false statements.In a public conversation at a Boeing factory in St. Louis, he lauded the number of jobs created on his watch and said “nobody would have believed that could have happened.” But in fact, 2.5 million new jobs were created in his first 13 months as president, almost exactly the same as the 2.6 million created in the 13 months before he became president and Mr. Obama was in the White House.As a businessman, Mr. Trump often fabricated or exaggerated to sell a narrative or advance his interests. In his memoir, “The Art of the Deal,” he called it “truthful hyperbole” or “innocent exaggeration.”When trying to lure investors to a casino project, he had bulldozers dig on one side of the site and dump the dirt on the other to give the impression that the project was making progress. He would call reporters and pretend to be a publicity agent for himself named John Barron or John Miller. He claimed to earn $1 million from a speech when it was $400,000. He claimed to be worth $3.5 billion when seeking a bank loan, four times what the bank eventually found.“He’s a salesman and that’s not about telling the truth, that’s not the DNA about being a salesman,” said Gwenda Blair, the author of “The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President,” a biography of his family. “The DNA of being a salesman is telling people what they want to hear. And he’s got it.”Jack O’Donnell, who was president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, recalled Mr. Trump telling New Jersey authorities that he had secured bank financing for a new casino and would not use junk bonds, only to turn around and then use junk bonds.“In my experience with him, there are times when he just compulsively lies and there are times when he strategically lies,” said Mr. O’Donnell, who wrote a scathing book about Mr. Trump. “In both regards, after he says something, I do think he believes that whatever he says becomes his reality. That’s my experience with him. It doesn’t have to be anything big but it certainly can be.”Mr. Trump continued his practice as president. The Washington Post’s fact-checker documented  2,140 false or misleading claims in Mr. Trump’s first year in office, a rate of nearly six a day, many of them repeated even after he was corrected.A Quinnipiac University poll in January showed that only 35 percent of Americans consider him honest, while 60 percent do not. In their first terms, more than 50 percent considered Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama honest, although those numbers fell for both by their second terms.Republicans as well as Democrats express concern. Amanda Carpenter, a former aide to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and former Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, has a new book coming out in May called “Gaslighting America: Why We Love It When Trump Lies to Us.” On the cover is an illustration of Mr. Trump with a Pinocchio nose.Her explanation is that Mr. Trump’s supporters do not see deception, they see a commitment to winning. “Donald Trump’s lies and fabrications don’t horrify America,” says the publisher’s summary of her book. “They enthrall us.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/trump-mueller-dowd.html","WASHINGTON — A lawyer for President Trump called on the Justice Department on Saturday to end the special counsel investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, shifting abruptly to a more adversarial stance as the inquiry appeared to be intensifying.The comments by the lawyer, John Dowd, were prompted by the firing late on Friday of the former deputy F.B.I. director Andrew G. McCabe. Mr. Dowd exhorted Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who oversees the special counsel, to end the inquiry and accused the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey of concocting a baseless investigation.“I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the F.B.I. Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt dossier,” Mr. Dowd told  The Daily Beast.His remarks capped another round of revelations in recent days that reinvigorated or displayed Mr. Trump’s frustrations with the investigation, which has cast a shadow over his presidency. He was said to be angered over a New York Times report that records from the Trump Organization were subpoenaed, and he celebrated the firing of Mr. McCabe, who was among the first F.B.I. officials to scrutinize possible links between Russia and the Trump team, calling his dismissal a “great day for Democracy”  on Twitter.On Saturday evening, Mr. Trump for the first time posted a tweet that specifically mentioned the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. The president again denounced the inquiry he is conducting as a “witch hunt.”“The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,” he wrote. “It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign.”Mr. Dowd, by contrast, did not name the special counsel in his statement, but the implication that he believed Mr. Mueller should be fired was unmistakable. Such a move could set off alarms among Republicans in Congress, who have largely stood by as the president repeatedly assailed the Justice Department and the F.B.I.Mr. Dowd said at first that he was speaking on behalf of the president but later backed off that assertion. He did not elaborate on why he was calling for the end of the investigation, saying only: “Just end it on the merits in light of recent revelations.”People close to the president were skeptical that Mr. Dowd was acting on his own. Mr. Trump has a history of using advisers to publicly test a message, giving him some distance from it. And Mr. Dowd’s comments came at a time when members of Mr. Trump’s legal team are jockeying to stay in his favor.Hours later, the president echoed Mr. Dowd’s accusations of corruption in the theoretical “deep state” that Mr. Trump has long cast as a boogeyman working to undermine him.“There was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State,” he wrote on Twitter.The president’s tweets, posted on a Saturday in which he remained inside the White House with no public schedule, came as Mr. Mueller is said to have sent questions to Mr. Trump’s legal team as part of negotiations over an interview with the president. Mr. Mueller is seeking the interview, according to two people close to the White House, in order to ask follow-up questions, but put forward the list as a start.Mr. Dowd’s remarks about Mr. Mueller’s investigation represented an extraordinary shift in public strategy for the Trump legal team. Since taking over the case last summer, Mr. Trump’s lawyers have urged a strategy of restraint, in which the president avoids discussing Mr. Mueller or criticizing him, and the lawyers had done nothing publicly until now that could agitate the special counsel’s team.The comments by both Mr. Trump and Mr. Dowd lent credence to Mr. McCabe’s assertion that the president sees his firing as directly tied into Mr. Mueller’s case. Mr. McCabe, who is a potential witness in the investigation, declared that his dismissal was an attempt to undermine it.Mr. Sessions fired Mr. McCabe for failing to be forthcoming with the department’s internal watchdog about a conversation he authorized between F.B.I. officials and a journalist.Like Mr. Comey, Mr. McCabe also kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president and his conversations with Mr. Comey, a person close to Mr. McCabe said on Saturday.The memos could support the account of Mr. Comey, who described in his memos and congressional testimony repeated requests from the president to clear his name. Mr. Comey said Mr. Trump also asked him to end an investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. The special counsel is investigating both matters.Mr. McCabe’s memos were left at the F.B.I., which means that Mr. Mueller’s investigators have access to them as they work to corroborate Mr. Comey’s account.Mr. McCabe’s lawyers had no comment on Saturday, and Mr. Rosenstein has repeatedly defended the special counsel, including in an interview this month with USA Today, in which he said he had seen no need to fire Mr. Mueller.Mr. Comey, who has a book scheduled to be published next month, weighed in himself.“Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he tweeted. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”The president’s supporters have tried to undercut the investigation as part of a broader attempt to clear him of wrongdoing. This month, Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee — which is led by a close ally of the president, Representative Devin Nunes of California — concluded their own investigation into Russia’s election meddling, saying they had determined the president did nothing wrong. Democrats on the panel accused Republicans of putting partisan politics ahead of fact finding.Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Mr. McCabe’s wife for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from a political committee tied to Terry McAuliffe, a Hillary Clinton ally, for a Virginia State Senate race, praised Mr. McCabe’s ouster again on Saturday.“The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation?” he tweeted. “How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!”Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration as the special counsel investigation has shown more signs of accelerating rather than ending. His legal team has worked to keep him from firing Mr. Mueller in the past. To keep the president at bay, the lawyers — led by the White House lawyer Ty Cobb — told him that Mr. Mueller’s investigation would be over by last December and that they would ask Mr. Mueller to put out a statement saying the president was not a target of the investigation.But instead, Mr. Trump was livid anew this week over the Times report that Mr. Mueller had subpoenaed his corporate records, including those related to Russia, according to one person close to the White House.The president’s lawyers appear to be feeling increasingly uneasy about where they stand. This month, Mr. Trump met with a veteran Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, to discuss coming on board to take over the president’s dealings with Mr. Mueller’s office and possibly replacing Donald F. McGahn II as White House counsel. The president’s personal lawyers, Mr. Dowd and Jay Sekulow, did not know about the meeting, prompting concerns that they could be pushed aside, and potentially making them less resistant to Mr. Trump’s whims about handling the inquiry.Last June, Mr. Trump backed down from his demand that Mr. Mueller be fired after Mr. McGahn threatened to quit. A month later, Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Times that the special counsel would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family’s finances beyond any relationship with Russia. After the Trump Organization subpoena was revealed on Thursday, Mr. Trump’s lawyers privately tried to play it down, in part to keep the president and his family calm.Mr. Dowd has been at the center of a string of embarrassing episodes in recent months. In December, he said he had written a tweet posted by the president that implied Mr. Trump knew that Mr. Flynn had lied to the F.B.I. when Mr. Trump fired him.Months earlier, Mr. Dowd was overheard by a Times reporter discussing details of a dispute inside the president’s legal team over lunch at a Washington steakhouse.Democrats seized on Mr. Dowd’s statement on Saturday. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called on lawmakers of both parties to defend Mr. Mueller.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/climate/scott-pruitt-political-ambitions.html","WASHINGTON — The headline speakers at the Conservative Political Action Conference’s annual showcase, the Ronald Reagan Dinner, have historically been rising stars in the Republican Party — firebrand pundits, prominent activists, future presidential candidates.Last month, it was Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.In the past year, Mr. Pruitt has emerged as a hero to President Trump’s supporters for his hand in rolling back environmental rules at an agency long disliked by farmers, the fossil fuel industry and the far right. And he has occasionally shocked his employees by criticizing the very agency he heads.“It was an agency that was weaponized against certain sectors of the economy,” Mr. Pruitt said to applause at the Reagan dinner.Now, people close to Mr. Pruitt say he is using his perch as Mr. Trump’s deregulatory czar to position himself for further political prominence — starting with a run for office in his home state of Oklahoma. He is widely viewed as a future candidate for senator or governor there, and Mr. Pruitt has made it known that if the president replaces his beleaguered attorney general, Jeff Sessions, he would be ready to step into the job.Mr. Pruitt’s national profile has soared. He has appeared on the cover of the prominent conservative magazines National Review and The Weekly Standard. And Mr. Trump has privately praised some of Mr. Pruitt’s more controversial proposals, such as his idea to stage “red team, blue team” debates of climate-change science.Mr. Pruitt has faced criticism, and received a reprimand from his boss, for spending more than $107,000 of public money on first-class air travel. But he remains a favorite of Mr. Trump’s, and after the past week of White House turmoil — with the president dismissing his secretary of state and intimating that a greater shake-up may follow — Mr. Pruitt appears to have job security that could work to his advantage over time.The endgame, say people who have spoken with Mr. Pruitt, is a possible run at the presidency in 2024 or later. “It was always known among elite Republicans that this guy had higher ambitions,” said Keith Gaddie, a professor of political science at the University of Oklahoma. “The question was just, ‘Does he want to be president, or does he want to be attorney general?’”To jump from E.P.A. chief to any of those posts would be highly unusual for the head of a historically wonky, low-profile agency. “The take has always been that E.P.A. is where your political career goes to die,” said William K. Reilly, who headed the agency under President George Bush.Even in Republican administrations, Mr. Reilly said, the job historically involved imposing regulations on polluting industries, which can create powerful enemies. “It’s the kind of job that if you do it right, you antagonize a lot of people — big industry, even your own president,” he said.But Mr. Pruitt has flipped the script. As Oklahoma’s attorney general, he sued the E.P.A. 14 times, and he has spent the past year working to undo regulations that would have required farmers to restrict their fertilizer use; oil and gas firms to control global warming pollution from their wells; and Midwestern power plants to burn less coal.“He has made a big splash,” Mr. Reilly said. “The mission he is on is not one that his predecessors at E.P.A. have recognized. And it could be a good strategy to win the constituency that elected the president.”Mr. Pruitt’s precise political path forward is not certain. He is viewed as a likely candidate to run for a Senate seat in Oklahoma in 2020 if the incumbent, James Inhofe, retires. But it remains unclear if Mr. Inhofe, 83, will do so, and his office declined to comment. There is also speculation that Mr. Pruitt might jump in as a last-minute candidate in this year’s governor’s race.When asked about its boss’s ambitions, Mr. Pruitt’s staff emphasizes that he is focused only on the job at hand. It also notes that the E.P.A. chief has made a significant effort to promote his work. “Administrator Pruitt has utilized a wide array of news outlets to advance President Trump’s agenda on regulatory certainty and environmental stewardship,” his spokesman, Jahan Wilcox, wrote in an email. Through Mr. Wilcox, Mr. Pruitt declined an interview request.Some former E.P.A. chiefs noted that Mr. Pruitt’s unusual speed at attempting to dismantle regulations could mean that those efforts might not stand up to later legal challenges. “The policies he’s pushing play very well in his home state and with the base — but you can’t do them overnight,” said Christine Todd Whitman, who headed the E.P.A. in the George W. Bush administration and before that was the governor of New Jersey. “They’re getting rushed out. I don’t think the homework is being done. It makes for good sound bites, but they might not stand up legally.”That might not affect Mr. Pruitt’s longer-term political aspirations, though. “Pruitt could be gone from E.P.A. by the time that happens,” Ms. Whitman said.Among the largest regulations Mr. Pruitt aims to roll back, at Mr. Trump’s direction, is an Obama-era clean water rule, known as Waters of the United States, which would have restricted the chemical fertilizers used by farmers. The rule has been particularly unpopular with the rural voters who make up the core of Mr. Trump’s base. This year, Mr. Pruitt announced he would freeze implementation of the rule and issue a more farmer-friendly version by the spring.Last year, Mr. Pruitt made two trips to Iowa, a key campaign state in presidential elections, to talk about his agenda. In the summer, he met with farmers to tout his rollback of the clean water regulation. In December, he promised that the E.P.A. would not use regulations to curb the production of corn ethanol — an issue considered key for presidential candidates in Iowa.Mr. Pruitt has also halted implementation of Mr. Obama’s climate change rules, which would have frozen construction of new coal-fired power plants, and has said he intends to propose a replacement rule this year. Last April, he spoke at a Pennsylvania coal mine, telling workers that “the regulatory assault is over.”Behind the scenes, Mr. Pruitt has spent time with major political donors. Last year he met with Foster Friess, a Republican fund-raiser, and with investors connected to Sheldon Adelson, the party megadonor, according to meeting records obtained by The New York Times. He also met with Steven Chancellor, an Indiana coal executive and Republican fund-raiser, according to documents obtained by the Sierra Club and published by Politico.“All of this is unusual,” Ms. Whitman said. “If you’re in a federal position, you should not appear to be campaigning.”Were Mr. Inhofe, long known as Congress’s most vocal opponent of efforts to fight global warming, to retire, Mr. Pruitt would be a natural fit to try to win his Senate seat.Mr. Pruitt, who keeps his watch set to the time in Oklahoma even when he is working on the East Coast, has traveled to his home state regularly. Last March through May he spent 43 out of 92 days in Oklahoma or traveling to or from the state, according to a report by the Environmental Integrity Project.Mr. Pruitt’s rise to prominence in Oklahoma began during the eight years he managed and co-owned the Oklahoma City RedHawks, a minor league baseball team. He won a seat in the State Legislature and opened a small legal office, Christian Legal Services, to challenge government actions that he saw as compromising individual rights.As an owner of the RedHawks, Mr. Pruitt ran television ads that featured himself promoting the team. They gave him statewide recognition and played a role in his 2010 race for attorney general, said Chris Wilson, an Oklahoma-based Republican strategist who worked on the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. “He had instant name recognition,” Mr. Wilson said.As attorney general, Mr. Pruitt built close ties with the state’s oil and natural gas industry. A 2014 investigation by The Times found that energy lobbyists drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send to the E.P.A., on state stationery, outlining the economic hardship of environmental regulations on their industries.The ties have paid off politically. Harold G. Hamm, who advised the presidential campaigns of Mr. Trump and Mitt Romney and is the chief executive of Continental Resources, an Oklahoma oil and gas company, was a co-chairman of Mr. Pruitt’s 2013 re-election campaign.Mr. Pruitt’s tenure at the E.P.A. has already proven popular with the oil and natural gas industry. His proposals have been aimed at loosening regulations, particularly an Obama-era rule that would have required companies to rein in emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, from new oil and gas wells. (A federal appeals court later ruled that the effort was illegal.)Energy companies were also delighted when Mr. Pruitt flew to Morocco in December, in an unusual trip aimed at promoting exports of natural gas. That trip received criticism, though, in part because the E.P.A. does not oversee natural gas exports.The E.P.A.’s inspector general is investigating some of Mr. Pruitt’s trips, including the one to Morocco and some to Oklahoma, but it is not clear whether that will be a liability. “It’s not great, but it’s not fatal,” Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who advised the Trump campaign, said referring to Mr. Pruitt’s airline expenses. “None of the old rules seem to apply,” he said. “The current president seems to have erased a lot of them.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/obituaries/louise-slaughter-dies.html","Louise M. Slaughter, a liberal Democrat who represented an upstate New York district in Congress for more than three decades, pushing to protect health privacy and abortion rights and playing a key role in the passage of President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul, died on Friday in Washington. She was 88 and in the midst of her 16th term in the House.In announcing her death, at George Washington University Hospital, her chief of staff, Liam Fitzsimmons, said Ms. Slaughter had sustained an injury last week at her home in Washington.Ms. Slaughter was a native of rural Kentucky who moved to the Rochester area with university degrees in microbiology and public health. Her studies shaped her agenda in the House, to which she was first elected in 1986 to represent Rochester and its surroundings.She rose to become the first chairwoman of the House Committee on Rules, which was formally constituted in 1789. She remained its ranking member.Legislation that Ms. Slaughter proposed in 1995, and for which she pressed repeatedly, was finally enacted in 2008 as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, aimed at banning discrimination by employers and insurers based on a person’s genetic information.She was equally persistent as a leader of a yearslong drive for a law to curb the widespread use of antibiotics in healthy cattle, pigs and chickens, a practice used to speed their growth.She and other critics said the practice had contributed to the emergence of bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics and capable of passing their resistance to human pathogens. But with livestock producers vigorously against the legislation, it had not been enacted at her death, to her great frustration. She had continued to call the stalling of the bill a bipartisan failure.Ms. Slaughter was chairwoman of the rules committee when Democrats were in the majority in the House from 2007 to 2010. The panel controls the debate and amendment process on the House floor, and she used its power to advance the Affordable Care Act, which passed the House by just five votes in 2009; all Republicans but one voted against it.The week President Obama signed the act, Ms. Slaughter was one of at least 10 Democratic lawmakers around the country targeted with vandalism and threats. A brick was thrown into one of her congressional offices, in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and a telephone message mentioning snipers was left on an answering machine at a campaign office. She accused Republicans of “fanning the flames with coded rhetoric.”Overall, Ms. Slaughter said on another occasion, “there are a lot of people in the United States that have just abject hate for the government.” Those who felt otherwise, she said, had the duty to convince them “that this government is not their enemy.”A longtime co-chairwoman of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus, Ms. Slaughter was a leader in fighting moves to reduce the scope of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. When the House defeated a 1989 measure to continue barring the District of Columbia from paying for abortions, she declared, “I don’t think there’s anything worse for women in this country than to watch men in blue suits debating this issue.”Ms. Slaughter, who was known for speaking bluntly in her Kentucky drawl, also helped lead a successful effort in 1994 to enact the Violence Against Women Act, which included federal funds for domestic violence shelters and for training the police, prosecutors and judges to better understand and respond to violent crimes against women. She was also prominent in calling on the Pentagon to crack down on sexual assaults of women in the military.Ms. Slaughter publicly regretted one success. In 1991 she was one of several congresswomen who marched to the Senate side of the Capitol to demand, successfully, that Anita F. Hill’s accusations of sexual harassment against Judge Clarence Thomas be heard during his confirmation proceedings after he was nominated for the Supreme Court.But Ms. Slaughter and others believed Ms. Hill was treated harshly when testifying before a Senate committee, and after Judge Thomas’s confirmation by the full Senate, Ms. Slaughter told The Boston Globe, “I felt guilty I’d ever asked them to go into it.”Although Ms. Slaughter voted against impeaching President Bill Clinton in the scandal over his sexual activities with a young White House intern, she did not hide her anger toward him — and not only for what she deemed his reckless behavior in that episode. She had long believed that Mr. Clinton had made too many deals with the Republicans.“I’m not interested in what happens to Bill Clinton,” she said in opposing impeachment. “It’s the country and the Constitution I’m concerned about.”The House impeached Mr. Clinton, but the Senate acquitted him.In 2012, as President Obama signed a bill that banned insider trading by members of Congress, he praised Ms. Slaughter for having introduced the first version of the legislation six years earlier and continuing to fight for it.A longtime co-leader of the Congressional Arts Caucus, Ms. Slaughter was involved in the annual battles to increase, or at least maintain, funding levels for federal arts and humanities agencies.She also worked for economic development aid to combat the declining fortunes of upstate New York, where her district at times stretched west from the Rochester area to Buffalo and Niagara Falls. And she opposed treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying they contributed to job losses in the United States.Dorothy Louise McIntosh was born on Aug., 14, 1929, in Lynch, Ky., to Oscar McIntosh and the former Daisy Grace Byers. She was often described in news articles and some campaign materials as a “coal miner’s daughter,” but her father had actually worked for coal mines as a blacksmith, a spokeswoman for Ms. Slaughter said in 2015. He later owned his own business as a machinist.Ms. Slaughter graduated from Somerset High School, in Somerset, Ky., in 1947 and earned a bachelor of science degree in microbiology and a master’s degree in public health, both from the University of Kentucky, in the early 1950s. She worked in market research for a chemical manufacturer before she and her husband, Robert Slaughter, whom she married in 1957, moved to the Rochester area, where he had obtained a job.Mr. Slaughter, who worked for the American Can and Eastman Kodak companies, died in 2014. Ms. Slaughter is survived by their three daughters, Megan Secatore, Amy Slaughter and Emily Minerva; seven grandchildren; and one great-grandson.Ms. Slaughter began her career in elective office by serving in the Monroe County Legislature from 1976 to 1979. She served in the New York State Assembly from 1983 to 1986, when she won her first term in Congress by narrowly defeating a Republican incumbent, Fred J. Eckert.Ms. Slaughter was handily re-elected every two years until 2014, when, in a year in which the Republicans increased their majority in the House, she squeaked through to victory by fewer than 1,000 votes against her Republican challenger, Mark Assini, a town supervisor in the area.In a rematch with him in 2016, however, voters, by a 12-point margin, sent Ms. Slaughter, the dean of New York’s congressional delegation, back to Capitol Hill.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/18/594321235/ohio-democrat-marcy-kaptur-makes-history-as-longest-serving-woman-in-the-house","Marcy Kaptur didn't plan for this.First elected in 1982, the Ohio Democrat didn't set out to become the longest-serving woman in House history.""The reasons that I ran, to change certain practices and policies, [I thought] could be done much more quickly,"" she said in an interview with NPR. On Sunday, Kaptur becomes the longest-serving woman ever to serve in the chamber with a tenure that spans 35 years, two months and 15 days.Capitol Hill can be a tough place to navigate for any junior legislator, even more so for a woman elected in the early years of the Reagan era. In her Rayburn office, Kaptur keeps a silver-framed photograph of the 1983 swearing-in ceremony on the House floor, presided over by then-Speaker Tip O'Neill, D-Mass.""That's me, right there,"" she says chuckling, pointing to a tiny, female head in the background of the House chamber, surrounded mostly by white men. ""Look it — compared to today.""Thirty-five years later, Kaptur is not so alone. Women and minorities now make up a majority of the House Democratic Caucus. This year, an unprecedented number of women are running for Congress and Kaptur sees a female wave on the horizon.""I think this is going to be another watershed year for women,"" she says. ""I think the climate is such that we can elect many more women here come November.""Awaiting those future legislators is the same reality check Kaptur learned a long time ago.""You get here and it's like you run into this big marshmallow, this mammoth marshmallow,"" she says. ""And it kind of absorbs you, and it's so hard to work your way through in order to get passage to do something different for the country.""Kaptur keeps one reminder of this ""Marshmallow Maxim"" in her Rayburn office. Hanging on the wall is a poster-sized aerial view of the World War II Memorial on the National Mall.""I have it here to remind me how long it took us to do something the American people wanted,"" she says. Kaptur wrote the bill to create the memorial — 1987. Seventeen years later, it opened to the public. ""I look at that and it reminds me how long it takes to do something good.""It's a lesson the women who came to Congress before Kaptur had to learn, too. She takes the longest-serving woman title from the late Rep. Edith Nourse Rogers, R-Mass.House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., paid tribute to both on the floor this week, saying: ""Edith Nourse Rogers famously summed up her time in office by saying this: 'The first 30 years are the hardest. You start it and you like the work and you just keep on.' Marcy, you have certainly kept on.""After 35 years in Washington, Kaptur reflects on her career with any apparent cynicism. She still marvels at the advancements she's made in her own life. ""I was rejected when I applied to the U.S. Air Force Academy, to Notre Dame University when I was first seeking to go to college, and to the FBI because I was a woman,"" she says.That was Kaptur's reality as a young woman. This is her reality now, as a senior lawmaker: ""Now I'm able to appoint women to our service academies. Obviously I defend the FBI here, especially of late, I recognize how important they are to the country, and Notre Dame now accepts women. So we've seen this change just in my lifetime, and it's a good thing.""At 71, Kaptur says she has no sights on retirement.""Well, I'm not finished with what I started to do,"" she explains."

The memos reportedly have been provided to the office of the special counsel conducting the Russia investigation and are similar to the notes compiled by Comey.The memos could factor into Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation as his team examines Trump campaign ties to Russia and possible obstruction of justice.McCabe's memos include details of his own interactions with the president, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation who wasn't authorized to discuss the notes publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.McCabe’s memos also recount different conversations he had with Comey.In the past year, Trump has repeatedly condemned McCabe as emblematic of an FBI that he insists is biased against his administration.Sessions said he acted on the recommendation of FBI disciplinary officials who said McCabe had not been candid with a watchdog office investigation.An upcoming inspector general's report is expected to conclude that McCabe, who spent more than 20 years with the FBI, had authorized the release of information to the media and was not forthcoming with the watchdog office as it examined the bureau's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.McCabe has vigorously disputed the allegations and said his credibility had been attacked as ""part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally"" but also the FBI and law enforcement.The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Trey Gowdy on Sunday split with President Trump and lawyer John Dowd’s apparent efforts to try to end the special counsel’s Russia investigation, saying Dowd did the president a “disservice” and that investigators need the “time, independence and resources” to complete the probe.“I think the president’s attorney, frankly, does him a disservice when he says that and when he frames the investigation that way,” Gowdy told “Fox News Sunday.” “If you have an innocent client, Mr. Dowd, act like it.”Dowd, Trump’s personal attorney, on Saturday called for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to end the investigation into whether Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election and if the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow in such efforts.Trump tweeted Sunday minutes before Gowdy spoke: “Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!”Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight committee and a former federal prosecutor, expressed hope that Trump and Dowd were not trying to strong-arm an end to the investigation and argued that the probe goes beyond trying to find or prove collusion."

Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat, on Saturday extended a job offer to McCabe so that he could reach is length of service and get his retirement benefits. McCabe released a statement Friday night suggesting his firing was part of the Trump administration's ""war on the FBI.""Trump praised the firing. The president suggested on Twitter that reports show McCabe ""knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!"" The president added that he was a “choirboy” compared with Comey.The inspector general's report is expected to conclude that McCabe, a Comey confidant, authorized the release of information to the media and was not forthcoming with the watchdog office as it examined the bureau's handling of its inquiry into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was secretary of state under President Barack Obama.""The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity and accountability,"" Sessions said in a statement.McCabe maintained that his credibility had been attacked as ""part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally,"" but also the FBI and law enforcement.""It is part of this administration's ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the special counsel investigation, which continue to this day,"" he added, referring to Robert Mueller's look into whether there was coordination between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign. ""Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the special counsel's work.""Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, touting the ""brilliant and courageous example"" by Sessions and the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility said in a statement Saturday that the No. 2 Justice Department official, Rod Rosenstein, ought to now  ""bring an end"" to the Russia investigation ""manufactured"" by Comey.Dowd told The AP that he was neither calling on Rosenstein, the deputy attorney government overseeing Mueller's inquiry, to fire the special counsel immediately, nor had discussed with Rosenstein the idea of dismissing Mueller or ending the probe.McCabe, in reacting to his untimely termination, asserted he was singled out because of the ""role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath"" of Comey's firing last May. McCabe became acting director after that and assumed direct oversight of the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign.Mueller is investigating whether Trump's actions, including Comey's ouster, constitute obstruction of justice. McCabe could be an important witness.Trump, in a tweet early Saturday, said McCabe's firing was ""a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI -- A great day for Democracy."" He said ""Sanctimonious James Comey,"" as McCabe's boss, made McCabe ""look like a choirboy.""McCabe said the release of the findings against him was accelerated after he told congressional officials that he could corroborate Comey's accounts of certain conversations with the president.McCabe spent more than 20 years as a career FBI official and played key roles in some of the bureau's most recent significant investigations.Even so, Trump has repeatedly condemned him over the past year as emblematic of an FBI leadership he contends is biased against his administration.McCabe had been on leave from the FBI since January, when he abruptly left the deputy director position. He had planned to retire on Sunday, and the dismissal probably jeopardizes his ability to collect his full pension benefits.His removal could add to the turmoil that has enveloped the FBI since Comey's firing and as the FBI continues its Trump campaign investigation that the White House has dismissed as a hoax.The firing arises from an inspector general review into how the FBI handled the Clinton email investigation. That inquiry focused not only on specific decisions made by FBI leadership, but also on news media leaks.McCabe came under scrutiny over an October 2016 news report that revealed differing approaches within the FBI and Justice Department over how aggressively the nonprofit  Clinton Foundation should be investigated.The watchdog office has concluded that McCabe authorized FBI officials to speak to a Wall Street Journal reporter for that story, and that McCabe had not been forthcoming with investigators. McCabe has issued denials.In his statement, McCabe said he had the authority to share information with journalists through the public affairs office, a practice he said was common and continued under the current FBI director, Christopher Wray. McCabe said he honestly answered questions about whom he had spoken to and when, and that when he thought his answers were misunderstood, he contacted investigators to correct them.The media outreach came at a time when McCabe said he was facing public accusations of partisanship and followed reports that his wife, during a run for the State Senate in Virginia, had received campaign contributions from a Clinton ally. McCabe suggested in his statement that he was trying to ""set the record straight"" about the FBI's independence against the background of those allegations.With the FBI disciplinarians recommending the firing, Justice Department leaders were in a difficult situation. Sessions, whose job status has for months appeared shaky under his own blistering criticism from Trump, risked inflaming the White House if he decided against firing McCabe.But a decision to dismiss McCabe days before his retirement nonetheless carried the risk of angering his rank-and-file supporters at the FBI.McCabe became entangled in presidential politics in 2016 when it was revealed that his wife, during her unsuccessful legislative run, received campaign contributions from the political action committee of then-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton friend.The FBI has said McCabe received the necessary ethics approval about his wife's candidacy and was not supervising the Clinton investigation at the time.But Trump pounded away on Twitter on Saturday: ""How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife's campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M ... How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!""  The Associated Press contributed to this report. "

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/17/trump-team-zeroes-in-on-fbi-russia-probe-in-wake-ex-deputy-director-mccabes-firing.html","President Trump escalated his criticism of the FBI and the Russia probe on Saturday, alleging “tremendous leaking, lying and corruption” from the bureau and other agencies and taking shots at fired former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and ex-Director James Comey.The result: an equally fiery response from former intelligence officials. McCabe was fired late Friday after an internal investigation found that he made an unauthorized leak to the media and “lacked candor” when speaking to investigators under oath. His firing came just days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pension.President Trump quickly ramped up the the rhetoric over the termination, calling it a “great day for Democracy!""He also skewered both McCabe and Comey, whom he accused of being sanctimonious and knowing “all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!”“How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!” the president tweeted.The FBI has said McCabe received the necessary ethics approval about his wife's candidacy and was not supervising the Clinton investigation at the time.On another front, Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, issued a statement Saturday morning calling on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing FBI Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry into possible Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, to shut down the probe. His statement also took a swipe at Comey, who was fired by Trump back in May 2017.“I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe’s boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,” he said in a statement to Fox News.“Just end it on the merits in light of recent revelations,” he added.While Dowd subsequently clarified that he was speaking in his personal capacity and not expressing Trump’s views, Trump appeared to give implicit support to the lawyer's thinking when he said that the House Intelligence Committee had concluded there was “no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign” (In fact, only Republicans on the committee had reached that conclusion, the top Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff noted in his own tweet on Saturday.)“As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State,” Trump continued.Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, told Fox News that Dowd's remarks seem like a new phase in the Trump team's attitude toward the Mueller probe.""It also seems important that the timing coincides with McCabe’s firing, so we can probably expect that there will be increasing pressure on [Rosenstein] to end the Mueller inquiry, although McCabe’s actions were only tangentially related to Mueller’s work,"" he said.FBI officials reacted angrily to the firing. McCabe described the termination  as part of an “ongoing war” against the FBI.""This attack on my credibility is one part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally, but to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally,"" McCabe said.""It is part of this Administration’s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the Special Counsel investigation, which continue to this day. Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the Special Counsel’s work,"" he added.Adding more intrigue, a source close to McCabe told Fox News Saturday that he kept memos memorializing his interactions with Trump, in a way that was very similar to the method Comey used to keep his own memos.Comey also weighed in, in a Twitter posting that also hinted at his coming tell-all book: “A Higher Loyalty.”“Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he tweeted. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Former CIA Director John Brennan, known for his outspoken criticisms of Trump, also weighed in -- blasting Trump in dramatic and colorful language and promising that “America will triumph over you.”Democrats quickly backed those officials. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, expressed concern about the state of the FBI investigation itself, saying Dowd’s statement show that the Trump team is looking to  “undermine [Mueller] at every turn.""""The president, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel's investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans,"" Schumer said in a statement.Jumping into the fray, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., called for the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing on ""escalating politicized attacks"" on the DOJ and FBI.“During my four decades in the Senate, I have never before seen our nation’s career, apolitical law enforcement officials so personally and publicly maligned by politicians — indeed, by our President,"" he said in a statement. ""And I have never been so concerned that the walls intended to protect the independence of our dedicated law enforcement professionals, including Special Counsel Mueller, are at risk of crumbling.""While the social media exchanges were especially intense earlier in the day on Saturday, Trump weighed in again on the issues associated with McCabe, and with the Mueller investigation, in the evening hours.Shortly after 8 p.m. ET, he tweeted: ""The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!""Fox News’ Jennifer Bowman, Brooke Singman, Jake Gibson, Jason Donner and Chad Pergram contributed to this report."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/17/mccabe-firing-was-required-because-fbi-must-have-zero-tolerance-for-lying-under-oath.html","No one should rejoice in the firing of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Friday. By all accounts, McCabe’s career over two decades of FBI service was marked with achievements.The firing, however, was based on the recommendation of a career FBI official under current FBI Director Chris Wray and was justified because the FBI has a zero tolerance for lying under oath. In fact, there are many examples of the rank and file in the FBI losing their jobs and retirement benefits for violating these high standards.If a different standard is applied at the most senior levels, the FBI is lost. So while this is a sad day, the action taken demonstrates that the dedicated men and women of the FBI will accept no lower standards, regardless of your rank or status.In other words this was the FBI itself recommending to the attorney general that – based on well- established precedent – one of their own should be fired for not meeting the high standards of integrity expected of an FBI employee.FBI disciplinary actions are based on facts and precedent from hundreds of cases that have been built up over many decades. These precedents are followed carefully in order to ensure consistency in FBI disciplinary actions.It's worth noting that as deputy director of the FBI, McCabe was entrusted with the responsibility to decide the fate of many FBI employees facing a wide variety of disciplinary actions. He had to decide whether to fire FBI employees for ""lack of candor.” It's only fitting that the same standard he imposed on others should apply to him.It is a serious mistake to assert that McCabe's firing was the result of some political vendetta. This was a simple case of an FBI executive who failed to set the highest ethical standards in his position as the No. 2 person in the FBI.Simply put, FBI agents who are entrusted with the life, liberty and property of our citizens through their investigative work cannot mislead, spin, nuance or lie under oath. Their word is the currency of the realm.Something happened during the tenure of former FBI Director Jim Comey. A small group of executives picked up some bad habits and practices. Leaks became acceptable if the leaker deemed it morally justified.The perception of impropriety regarding actions that were legal but clearly questionable – such as campaign contributions received by McCabe's wife in her unsuccessful race as a Democratic candidate for a Virginia state Senate seat – were ignored.Despite the longstanding rules codified in the federal regulations and FBI manuals that FBI ongoing investigations are not discussed publicly for any reason, former Director Comey laid out the Clinton email investigation in an excruciatingly detailed news conference and then proceeded to make a prosecutorial decision that was not his to make. Comey’s own leaks are well known. Leaks are intolerable because they stigmatize people who are presumed to be innocent. And most importantly, leaks of details of investigations are a violation of the law. An FBI agent sworn to uphold the law simply can't break the law – not to set the record straight, not to influence the court of public opinion, and certainly not to satisfy some personal agenda.Leaking and lying undermine the credibility of the FBI, not just the leaker or liar. As a 24-year veteran of the FBI, I served under exemplary directors such as William Webster, Louis Freeh and Robert Mueller. These men set an example of integrity, humility and an absolute, unconditional adherence to the rule of law. That culture is set at the top of the house in any entity, whether it's a U.S. corporation or the FBI.While it's heartbreaking to see a career FBI special agent lose his pension, it is important for the FBI to send a message to every employee in the agency that that all employees are held to the same high standards, especially those on the 7th Floor executive offices.To call this a political decision is to impose a lower standard on the FBI. That is something that we should not accept from the nation's the premier law enforcement agency."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/17/andrew-mccabes-firing-was-justified-and-right-thing-to-do.html","After reading a detailed and damning recommendation by the Justice Department’s non-partisan inspector general that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe be immediately fired for integrity reasons, Attorney General Jeff Sessions followed the recommendation Friday night.McCabe’s firing was legally and morally appropriate and was necessary.Sessions said in a statement: ""Pursuant to Department Order 1202, and based on the report of the Inspector General, the findings of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility, and the recommendation of the Department’s senior career official, I have terminated the employment of Andrew McCabe effective immediately."" Politics aside, here is why that decision was right, why McCabe will not win his full pension back on appeal, and why his indignant, self-serving and political reaction is dead wrong.McCabe is an attorney who joined the FBI in 1996. At that time, he took an oath to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States,” vowed to “bear true faith and allegiance to the same,” and to  “well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office,” ending “so help me God.”As deputy director and acting director, McCabe failed miserably. According to the inspector general, congressional investigators and Attorney General Sessions, McCabe effectively breached his oath.McCabe became deputy director of the FBI in February 2016. He seemed destined for greatness, and perhaps inclined toward the Clintons. An Obama appointee, he had promising political ties and nowhere to go but up.McCabe’s wife, Jill, was politically disposed, a vocal Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for a Virginia state Senate seat just three months before her husband became FBI deputy director.She raised $1.6 million for her race – twice her opponent’s war chest – including $780,000 that came from political sources, some closely tied to the Clintons.Then came the series of integrity missteps by Andrew McCabe, which would likely have gone undiscovered, or perhaps simply covered up, had Hillary Clinton been elected president in 2016.First, McCabe did not recuse himself from the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s email server.Call that bad judgement, but he may have wanted to guard the process, protecting the likely future president, who might have rewarded him once in the Oval Office.The obvious conflict of interest, and blatant perception of one, was simply ignored, with McCabe claiming he did not oversee public corruption cases in Virginia nor undertake his role in the investigating the Clinton emails until his wife’s campaign was finished.Then, with McCabe handling the Clinton investigation, a pall of silence fell during the critical 2016 election year over the whole process.One can, to a degree and with a straight face, claim that standard and ongoing investigations deserve silence. But the Clinton email investigation was not standard, and the internal process that intimately involving McCabe and Comey was also not standard.Then-Attorney General Loretta Lynch privately and shockingly talked with the investigation target’s husband, former President Clinton, and then told Comey not to publicly call this investigation an investigation, but only a “matter.”  McCabe played along.Then in in September 2016 a bombshell was discovered. On the computer of top Clinton aide Human Abedin’s husband – disgraced former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, under investigation for other illegal activity – investigators found hundreds of thousands of emails tied to Hillary Clinton. The emails were voluminous and damning.What did McCabe do?  He did not tell tell his boss, James Comey. This was a hot a potato coming two months before the presidential election, and McCabe dropped it.In what might make a good opening paragraph for Hillary Clinton’s next book, “What Happened, Version II,” McCabe made a fatal mistake, assuming his goal was to protect Hillary Clinton.Getting the critical information on the Clinton emails in September 2016, McCabe did not reveal it to FBI Director Comey until Oct. 27, forcing Comey on national television to raise questions about Clinton’s integrity days before the general election.Ironies are seldom so clean, and violations of duty seldom so clear. In an apparent effort to shield a previous and potentially future political patron, McCabe badly bobbled the ball, actually adding to her peril. But that is not the main point.The main point is – as the inspector general congressional investigators and others have noted – McCabe shaded the truth repeatedly.McCabe told congressional investigators that the FBI had sought a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court to spy on a Trump campaign adviser, using information they knew was paid for by the Clinton campaign, but never told the FISA Court the information’s origins.McCabe even reportedly noted that, without that Clinton opposition research, the warrant would not have been granted by the FISA Court.Add this to emails indicating he was party to some “insurance” gambit, presumably starting the “Russia collusion” probe, which might be used as a foil if Trump won, which he did.While all sounding wildly nefarious, the whole business really reeks of adolescent giddiness and amateur political machinations, in a place there should be no politics. It reeks of terrible judgement, at the top of the FBI. That may be the real reason Comey was removed earlier, and why McCabe had to go now.Likely the final straw, was – as the inspector general detailed and Attorney General Sessions confirmed – that McCabe, who had otherwise risen through a distinguished career, doubled back to protect himself. The cover-up always does it.Reportedly, McCabe lied to the inspector general, or in euphemistic and delicately modern parlance, he “had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor – including under oath – on multiple occasions.”Although it need not be said, Attorney General Sessions wryly noted:  “The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability.” The Office of Professional Responsibility noted: “All FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that integrity is our brand.”There the story of McCabe ends. What is happening, plain and simple, is that justice – and respect for the non-political oath taken by all men and women at the FBI, Justice Department and in federal service – is being restored. And that is the truth."

They showed no concern for the abuse of power that might entail.(By contrast, when evidence emerged in 2014 that the CIA had spied on staffers on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republicans joined Democrats in condemning the agency’s behavior, calling it “treason.”)Power later tried to walk back her tweet:Whoa!

Dario Viganò, read a selection from Benedict’s letter aloud at the book presentation on Monday emphasizing the “spiritual continuity” between his pontificate and that of Francis. Soon afterward, Viganò’s office released the doctored photograph of the first page of the letter, which also contained a glimpse of Benedict’s signature, while carefully concealing the contents of the second page.In announcing its decision Saturday to release the full contents of the letter, the unsigned Vatican communiqué adopted a decidedly defensive tone, calling the photo-doctoring an “alleged censorial manipulation” of the image.The decision to alter the photo was “motivated by discretion and not by any attempt at censorship,” the statement reads, adding that the Vatican had decided to make the letter available in its entirety “to dispel any doubt.”Unfortunately, the concealed content of the letter that has now been made public suggests that the communications office wished to spin Benedict’s letter in a way that would have been impossible had the whole letter been released.After saying that he would not write a preface to the collection, since on principle he would never express an opinion on texts that he had never read (and he had no intention of reading them any time soon), the emeritus pope proceeded to criticize the editor’s choice to entrust one of the volumes to a dissenting theologian known for his hostility to the papal magisterium.Benedict notes his “surprise” at the choice of professor Peter Hünermann as one of the authors, since he “distinguished himself during my pontificate by spearheading anti-papal projects.”Moreover, Hünermann was a key figure in the publication of the Kölner Erklärung, which, “virulently attacked the magisterial authority” of Pope John Paul II, “especially concerning moral theology,” Benedict wrote.Additionally, on founding the “Europäische Theologengesellschaft,” Hünermann conceived of the association’s identity “in opposition to the papal magisterium” which was only altered later because of the good sense of other theologians in the group, Benedict said.Even prior to the Vatican’s release of the full text of the letter, veteran Vatican analyst Sandro Magister wrote that he had learned from an “unimpeachable source” that the second page of Benedict’s letter contained a criticism of the judgment of the editors in having Peter Hünermann write one of the volumes.The fact that the news had already been leaked leaves room for the possibility that the Vatican only released the full contents of the letter because the damage had already been done, rather than out of an attempt to atone for its lack of integrity in doctoring the letter.The Lettergate scandal has hit the Vatican particularly hard because it follows on the heels of the publication of a document in which Pope Francis forcefully denounced the spread of “fake news.”The Vatican’s manipulation of the photograph, which the Associated Press (AP) said “violated photojournalist industry standards,” came just two months after Pope Francis railed against disinformation and “fake news” in his annual Message for the World Day of Communications.In that Message, Francis said that he wished to contribute to “stemming the spread of fake news and to rediscovering the dignity of journalism and the personal responsibility of journalists to communicate the truth.”Fake news “refers to the spreading of disinformation on line or in the traditional media,” the pope said. “It has to do with false information based on non-existent or distorted data meant to deceive and manipulate the reader.”Even a “slight distortion of the truth can have dangerous effects,” Francis said.Even prior to the release of the Message, Pope Francis had denounced the spread of fake news on several occasions, comparing it to excrement and condemning it as a “very grave sin.”Follow Thomas D.

This must be investigated.Both of these tweets raise enormous questions, not only about what is meant by these threats, but what kind of inside information these former Obama officials might be receiving from unauthorized sources.Friday night, after the long overdue firing of Andrew McCabe, the disgraced former acting FBI director, the president tweeted to the American people that McCabe’s termination (and possible loss of pension) marks a “great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI – A great day for Democracy.”Trump added that “James Comey … made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!”James Comey is disgraced former head of the FBI fired by Trump last year.Trump’s criticism of Comey is not speculation. We now know that Comey leaked internal memos about his alleged conversations with Trump to the media through a surrogate, an act that many believe violated FBI rules, possibly even rules surrounding classified information. Moreover, Comey’s greasy fingerprints appear to be all over the discredited Russian dossier and the FISA warrants obtained using the dossier to spy on surrogates of the Trump campaign.For his part, though, and in keeping with his reputation as a man with a high opinion of himself, Comey responded with a rather anodyne  tweet that was equal parts self-love and salesmanship (his book comes out next month): “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.— James Comey (@Comey) March 17, 2018Brennan, however, appeared unhinged by Trump’s tweet, but he wants the world to know that he knows something and he knows something will be done about it.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” Brennan blasted to Trump on Twitter. “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America…America will triumph over you.”When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history. You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will  not destroy America…America will triumph over you. https://t.co/uKppoDbduj— John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) March 17, 2018The question now is what does Brennan know? And where did he get the information that allows him to confidently threaten a sitting president with “disgrace” and a place “in the dustbin of history?”Brennan’s tweet took on an even more ominous tone after Power later tag-teamed it with this tweet: “Not a good idea to piss off John Brennan,” she warned, with a link to Brennan’s tweet threatening Trump.Not a good idea to piss off John Brennan. https://t.co/VLg94OLL2R— Samantha Power (@SamanthaJPower) March 17, 2018Again, Brennan is the former head of the CIA, a man with incalculable residual power through various contacts, not just within the bureaucratic Deep State, but within the wide world of international spycraft.Power, who is at the center of an ongoing investigation looking into the unprecedented unmasking of American citizens (that possibly included Trump campaign surrogates), obviously believes that Brennan being “pissed off” at Trump means things will now happen, that Trump will pay a price, that Brennan will come out on top.This is all very ominous, unquestionably a threat, and also makes one wonder if Brennan and Power are receiving unauthorized information, possibly from Robert Mueller’s special counsel office. Even the mainstream media, firmly in Mueller’s corner in their desire to destroy Trump, have repeatedly reported things that could only have come via leaks from the special counsel’s office.The very idea that a Brennan and Power, two former Cabinet-level officials in the Obama administration, are publicly hurling not-so-veiled threats at a sitting American president, is not only beyond the pale, but must be taken seriously.It is important to remember that this is not the first time Trump has been threatened with Deep State reprisal. In January of last year,  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, (D-NY) seemed to gloat over the fact that the intelligence community has “six ways from Sunday at getting back at you” — meaning Trump.In February, Phil Mudd, a CNN counter-terrorism analyst, publicly warned Trump that the F.B.I would seek revenge against Trump and “win.”This is the rhetoric of a state run by an un-elected secret police force, not a representative democracy where the intelligence community is supposed to answer to the people through our elected representatives.Only a new special counsel can look into these threats. The Secret Service might also want to get itself involved.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/california/2018/03/18/californias-98-billion-bullet-train-price-tag-due-to-spiking-tunnel-costs/","California’s bullet train appears to have released a “High Case” estimate of $98.1 billion to prepare the public for much higher tunneling costs.Breitbart News reported on March 9 that the California High-Speed Rail Authority’s (CHSR) new chief program officer, Roy Hill, had issued a 114-page “2018 Draft Budget” with a “Base Case” cost to build the 500-mile bullet train that had more than doubled to $77.3 billion, or $155 million per mile.That compared to the $37 billion, $74 million-per-mile plan that Gov. Schwarzenegger and other advocates claimed when they convinced voters to pass Proposition 1A in 2008.CHSR’s first comprehensive financial review in a decade acknowledged, “The worst-case scenario has happened.” But CHSR — for the first time — included a “High Case” estimate that warned costs could spike to $98.1 billion, or $196 million per mile.In a stunning disclosure, Hill’s team admitted that after spending $5.4 billion over the past 12 years, CHSR has only “advanced to a 15 percent design in most of the segments, as documented in preliminary engineering reports.” Even more jarring, the final design of first 119-mile segment of track between Madera and just North of Bakersfield, which began construction last year, “has only “been advanced to between 65 percent and 100 percent.”The divergence between CHSR’s “Base Case” and “High Case” involves an $11.2 billion cost variance to traveling from Los Angeles and Bakersfield by crossing the Tehachapi Mountains though either the 3,300-foot Tejon Pass along the I-5 Freeway, or the further inland Antelope Valley Pass through Palmdale.Either route would create the highest-elevation bullet train mountain crossing on the planet. In addition to the required tunneling being technically challenging and wildly expensive, the mountains are crisscrossed with numerous earthquake faults that are rated as very active.Breitbart News reported in 2015 that CHSR estimated that Tehachapi tunneling would begin in 2019. CHSR claimed that with 600-foot long multi-bladed tunnel boring machines, with a crew of 20 and working 20 hours per day, CHSR would drill 100 to 200 feet a day.But according to a Los Angeles Times interview with MIT Professor of Civil Engineering Herbert Einstein, that projection assumes optimal mountain conditions for the dig. He expects California’s maze of fractured granite rock and fault lines will slow progress to 10 to 20 feet a day. Einstein estimates that working 261 days a year, it will take 7 years at 20 feet per day and 14 years at 10 feet a day.Another major risk factor that is not addressed in the draft budget is the continued reliance on finding a $13 billion public-private partnership that was first incorporated into the CHSR 2012 Business Plan to avoid a huge cost spike.The Wall Street bankers that Breitbart News spoke to for this article state that there is little interest in high-speed rail public-private partnerships due to the spiraling costs, especially in California. Several mentioned the cost to build a six-mile expansion of Bay Area Rapid Transit to San Jose is estimated at $4.7 billion, or $780 million a mile.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/17/virginia-delegate-supports-code-ethics-reign-teachers-political-activism/","Before thousands of school children poured out of schools across the country last week to demand “gun control,” the resolution introduced by Republican member of the Virginia House of Delegates Dave LaRock might not have gained a lot of attention.The National School Walkout on Wednesday was organized by left-wing groups, including the Women’s March and Planned Parenthood, and was meant to “honor” the 17 people who died last month after a former student with mental health issues went on a shooting spree at a Florida high school.In many places, including Washington, DC, the walkout turned into protests where young students threatened lawmakers and demanded the gun control agenda of those left-wing groups who organized them.But now the resolution LaRock introduced in January seems like an idea that is desperately needed to protect American school children from being indoctrinated instead of educated.LaRock explained in an interview on Breitbart News Saturday with Washington Deputy Political Editor Amanda House on SiriusXM Patriot 125 that his resolution asks the Board of Education to come up with a code of ethics for teachers in grades K-12.Like the federal Hatch Act, LaRock’s resolution — inspired by conservative pundit David Horowitz — would prevent individuals from using their position to promote their political views or support a specific candidate.“That’s exactly what is happening in schools,” LaRock said. “I think many teachers are using their position as a role model and an educator.”Teachers are “imposing their own personal views — very often their pretty extremely liberal views — on kids through lessons and comments and sometimes even bullying kids that don’t agree with their liberal viewpoint,” LaRock said.“It’s just very, very inappropriate and wrong,” LaRock said, citing an example of a local school teacher who signed up to be a coordinator for the walkout on a website using her school e-mail address.And while the desire to keep kids safe in school is not a partisan issue, using children as “political tools” is not the way to achieve that goal, LaRock said.“We all share the goal of making schools safer,” LaRock said.“But to have these kids — put them out in the spotlight — I think in many cases ill-informed — and using them as political tools is right out of the Alinsky school of political activism,” LaRock said, referring to Saul Alinsky, the so-called founder of “community organizing.”“So this K-12 Code of Ethics for teachers simply proposes setting some boundaries — reasonable boundaries — that respects teachers’ right to free speech maybe in their off time, but also recognizes that when they have kids there in the classroom that’s not a time for the teacher to be promoting their own personal viewpoints or policies or candidates,” La Rock said.LaRock said parents were caught off guard by the walkout, but now many are angry about it.“There are a lot of people that are pretty furious about this,” LaRock said. “I think it took a while to sink in because we do think of schools as places where kids go to be taught in reading, writing, and arithmetic and a bunch of other good things but not to be trained into being little activists,” LaRock said.LaRock said students should be taught to be critical thinker, not recipients of political rhetoric.He said parents need to get involved in their children’s education.“Parents need to be driving the discussion, whether it’s with the schools themselves or with their own kids so that we’re not just this angry mob reacting on emotion,” LaRock said.Follow Penny Starr on TwitterMOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/17/nine-major-problems-james-comeys-involvement-trump-hoax-dossier/","NEW YORK — James Comey took to Twitter on Saturday to respond to an earlier tweet by President Donald Trump about the Russia probe, with the former FBI director exclaiming that the “American people will hear my story very soon.”“And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not,” Comey added.Comey was responding to Trump’s charge that the ex-FBI chief was aware of illicit activity at the FBI regarding the probe into unsubstantiated claims of Russian collusion.As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State. #DrainTheSwamp— Donald J.

Comey knew it all, and much more!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2018Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.— James Comey (@Comey) March 17, 2018Below, in no particular order, are nine major problems with Comey’s actions in the Russia probe.  This while he tweets about determining who is “honorable.”1 – Comey signed FISA applications that cited the largely discredited anti-Trump dossier as purported evidence to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, who briefly served as a volunteer campaign foreign policy adviser.The previously released four-page House Intelligence Committee memo alleging abuse of surveillance authority documents that on October 21, 2016, the FBI and Justice Department sought and received the FISA order against Page, and that the agencies sought the renewal of the order every 90 days in accordance with court requirements. Renewals require separate finding of probable cause each time, the memo relates.According to the memo, Comey “signed three FISA applications in question on behalf of the FBI, and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one.” The memo relates that the FBI utilized the anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele as evidence against Page in order to obtain the FISA warrant.The controversial Fusion GPS hired Steele’s company, Orbis Business Intelligence, to do the anti-Trump work that resulted in the compilation of the infamous dossier.  Fusion GPS was paid for its anti-Trump work by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee via the Perkins Coie law firm.Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee last month released a purported rebuttal to the House GOP memo, but the Democrats’ document actually confirmed that Comey’s FISA applications did indeed cite the Steele dossier.2 – Comey reportedly did not tell the FISA court that Steele’s dossier was funded by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).After reviewing all FISA warrant applications on the matter, the Republican memo confirms the FISA court was never informed that Steele was working on behalf of Perkin Coie, the DNC or Hillary’s campaign.  Still, Comey cited Steele’s work to sign FISA applications to monitor an American citizen.In an attempt to rebut the Republican argument that the FISA court was not informed about the dossier’s specific origins, the Democratic memo quotes from an explanation to the court that Steele:was approached by an identified U.S. person who indicated to Source #1 [Steele] that a U.S.-based law firm had hired the identified U.S. person to conduct research regarding Candidate #1’s ties to Russia. (The identified U.S. person and Source #1 have a long-standing business relationship.) The identified U.S. person hired Source #1 to conduct this research. The identified U.S. person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into candidate #1’s ties to Russia.  The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1’s campaign.Contrary to the rebuttal’s characterization, this paragraph is a far cry from informing the court that the dossier utilized in the FISA warrant was paid for by Trump’s primary political opponents, namely Clinton and the DNC.  Also, the general mention of  “a U.S.-based law firm” does not identify to the FISA court the actual firm, Perkins Coie, which is known for its representation of Clinton and the DNC. Further, informing the FISA court about “an identified U.S. person” who hired Steele fails to actually identify that U.S. person as Glenn Simpson, founder of the controversial Fusion GPS.The Democrats claim that the above-referenced paragraph proves the Obama-era agencies informed the FISA court about the “political” origins of the dossier. However, the Republican memo specifically and apparently correctly charged that “neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele’s efforts.”  The Democratic memo fails to dispute that charge.3 – Comey’s FISA application reportedly did not inform the court that Steele had been hired by Fusion GPS.The GOP memo relates that the initial FISA application notes Steele worked for a “named U.S. person,” but does not name Fusion GPS or its founder Simpson. The Democrats’ rebuttal contains no evidence that Comey informed the FISA court about the involvement of Fusion GPS. Breitbart News has released a series of articles documenting credibility issues faced by Fusion GPS and its leadership.4 – Comey’s FISA application is accused of incorrectly assessing that Steele did not provide information to Yahoo News.A Yahoo News article about an alleged trip by Page to Moscow was cited as purported evidence against Page in the FISA warrant, according to the House GOP memo. However, the memo relates that the Page FISA application “incorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide information to Yahoo News.”The memo continued:Steele has admitted in British court filings that he met with Yahoo News and several other outlets in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie was aware of Steele’s initial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington DC in 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed.5 – Comey cited the dossier in the FISA applications to monitor Page even though he personally called the information contained in Steele’s dossier “salacious and unverified” months later.Comey first filed the FISA application citing the dossier on October 21, 2016, according to the GOP memo. Yet during his June 8, 2017 prepared remarks before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Comey referred to the anti-Trump dossier as containing “salacious and unverified” material.6 – Comey cited the Steele dossier in the applications to monitor Page even though his own FBI determined the document was “only minimally corroborated.”The GOP memo relates that after dossier author Christopher Steele was terminated months earlier as an FBI source a “source validation report conducted by an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele’s reporting as only minimally corroborated.” Still, Comey saw fit, according to the Republican and Democrat memos, to utilize the dossier in the FISA documents. He also briefed Trump and then-President Barack Obama on the dossier contents.7 – Comey admitted to pushing back against a request from Trump to possibly investigate the origins of claims made inside the dossier. According to the GOP memo, senior officials at the FBI were aware that Clinton and the DNC partially financed Steele’s work when they applied for the FISA warrant on October 21, 2016. That disclosure raises questions about Comey’s June 2017 prepared remarks for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in which he related that he pushed back against a suggestion from Trump to investigate the origins of the dossier claims.The former FBI chief stated that following a January 6 Oval Office meeting with Intelligence Community leaders, Comey “remained alone with the President Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.”It is clear Comey was referring to the dossier since he writes that the “salacious and unverified” material was about to be publically reported by the news media. Four days after that briefing, the dossier was published by BuzzFeed.In his statement summarizing his conversation with Trump, Comey refers to Russian prostitutes, a key component of the dossier:He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia.In a private White House dinner with Trump on January 27, Comey says the topic of the “salacious material” again came up and he reveals that Trump was considering asking the FBI to investigate the origins of the claims. Comey pushed back against that idea.Comey writes:During the dinner, the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn’t happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren’t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it.However, according to the GOP memo, senior FBI officials already knew the political origins of the dossier months before Comey met with Trump.8 – Comey briefed Trump and Obama on the contents of the dossier in an official, formal classified briefing even though he knew the document’s political origins, his own FBI determined the document to be “only minimally corroborated”, and Comey himself later referred to the dossier as “unverified.” The briefing was subsequently leaked to the news media and started a flurry of publicity about the wild accusations inside the dossier.As Breitbart News documented, the leak about Comey’s dossier briefing to Trump set in motion a barrage of news media attention on the dossier, including the release of the document to the public. The briefing also may have provided the veneer of respectability to a document circulated within the news media but widely considered too unverified to publicize.The GOP memo relates that in early January 2017, prior to Trump’s inauguration, Comey briefed Trump and Obama on the dossier even though months later Comey would label the dossier as containing “salacious and unverified” material.On January 10, CNN was first to report the leaked information that the controversial contents of the dossier were presented during classified briefings inside classified documents presented one week earlier to Obama and Trump.The news network cited “multiple U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the briefings” – in other words, officials leaking information about classified briefings – revealing the dossier contents were included in a two-page synopsis that served as an addendum to a larger report on Russia’s alleged attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.Prior to CNN’s report leaking the Comey briefing to Trump, which was picked up by news agencies worldwide, the contents of the dossier had been circulating among news media outlets, but the sensational claims were largely considered too risky to publish.All that changed when the dossier contents were presented to Obama and Trump during the classified briefings. In other words, Comey’s briefings themselves and the subsequent leak to CNN about those briefings by “multiple US officials with direct knowledge,” seem to have given the news media the opening to report on the dossier’s existence as well as allude to the document’s unproven claims.CNN, for example, reported the documents state that “Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump” and contain “allegations that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.”9 – Comey’s FBI may have utilized a second dossier authored by Cody Shearer, a shadowy former tabloid journalist who has long been closely associated with various Clinton scandals.The Democrats’ rebuttal states that the DOJ provided the FISA court with “additional information obtained through multiple independent sources that corroborate Steele’s reporting.” The rebuttal does not mention the names of the other “independent sources.”Shearer reemerged in the news cycle in recent weeks when the Guardian newspaper reported that the FBI has been utilizing a second dossier authored by Shearer as part of its probe into Trump and alleged Russian collusion.The Guardian reported the so-called Shearer memo was given to the FBI by Steele in October 2016 to back up some of his claims.According to the Guardian report, the FBI was still assessing portions of the Shearer memo at the time the Guardian article was released. The newspaper reported that, like Steele’s dossier, Shearer’s memo cites an “unnamed source within Russia’s FSB” alleging that Trump was compromised by Russian intelligence during a 2013 trip to Moscow in which the future president purportedly engaged in “lewd acts in a five-star hotel.”Shearer’s name was reportedly associated with a criminal referral of Steele by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). That referral contains partially redacted sentences that Steele received information from someone in the State Department, who in turn had been in contact with a “foreign sub-source” who was in touch with a redacted name described as a “friend of the Clintons.”Numerous media reports have since stated that the second dossier author mentioned in the Grassley-Graham memo was Shearer, an associate of longtime Clinton friend Sidney Blumenthal.According to sources who spoke to CNN, Shearer’s information was passed from Blumenthal to Jonathan Winer, who at the time was a special State Department envoy for Libya working under then-Secretary of State John Kerry.Citing the same source, CNN reported that Shearer’s dossier is “actually a set of notes based on conversations with reporters and other sources.” CNN reported that Shearer had “circulated those notes to assorted journalists, as well as to Blumenthal.”Winer subsequently penned a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department, he exchanged documents and information with Steele and that some of the information passed to Steele originated with Shearer. Winer acknowledged that he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by Sidney Blumenthal.National Review previously dubbed Shearer a “Creepy Clinton Confidante” and “The Strangest Character in Hillary’s Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy.”Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

It was terrifying and I still can’t believe it happened. He is a big guy. He came up behind me fast, aggressive and very physical. Who knows what this lunatic was thinking?”Police “arrested an adult male for simple assault against another individual outside room 1324 in the Longworth House Office Building,” an officer told Politico.A person familiar with the incident said the man is Mark Stark, a left-wing activist with a history of disruptive behavior.The Washington Post reported on Oct. 31, 2017, that Stark was arrested after arguing with police and refusing police orders at a parade in Virginia.The local NBC affiliate in Charlottesville, Va., ran a letter written by “citizen journalist” Stark after a run-in with staffers of then-Sen. George Allen (R-VA) at a campaign stop.A Wikipedia page says Stark has written for the Daily Kos and the Huffington Post.At his arrest on Thursday, Stark said he was a reporter with American Bridge 21st Century, which, according to its website, is “a progressive research and communications organization committed to holding Republicans accountable for their words and actions and helping you ascertain when Republican candidates are pretending to be something they’re not.”Swift said the anti-Trump aggression toward supporters is contrary to Democrats’ claim that they are pro-woman.“Since joining the Trump Administration I’ve received harassing and threatening tweets, emails, phone calls, and letters (to include death threats) but being physically targeted and assaulted brings it to another level,” Swift said. “This violent action only strengthens my desire to serve my president and my country.”“Democrats claim to support women but they allow their operatives to assault women,” Swift said. “They need to immediately denounce this type of violent behavior.”Laura Rigas, DOI communications director, agrees.“I am greatly alarmed and extremely irate that a female senior member of my DOI Communications team was physically assaulted … by a Democrat staffer from the PAC American Bridge,”  Rigas said in a statement. “These politically motivated, personal, written, verbal, and now physical attacks against Trump administration officials must stop.”“Violent physical attacks have no place in politics, at work, or in our society,” Rigas said. “The perpetrator has been arrested and charged, and we thank the Capitol Police for their quick action.”According to Open Secrets, left-wing billionaire George Soros has contributed $2 million to American Bridge 21st Century in 2015 and 2016. In 2015, left-wing climate change activist Tom Steyer gave the organization $250,000.Police did not respond to a Breitbart News’s request for confirmation that the man arrested is Stark.Follow Penny Starr on TwitterMOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Both had been previously removed and are citizens of Mexico. One was previously convicted of statutory rape and the other is a known street gang member who was previously convicted of domestic violence.One citizen of Kazakhstan and two Mexican nationals were specifically identified in the ICE release as among the 115 arrested.“Depending on the alien’s criminal history, an alien who illegally reenters the United States, after having been previously removed, has committed a felony punishable by up to 20 years in federal prison,” according to the ICE release. Fifty of those arrested are convicted criminals. ICE made 108 of the arrests in San Diego County. The remaining seven were arrested in Imperial County.Four of those arrested face federal criminal prosecution for re-entering the United States after prior deportation. Some are being processed for removal or if under outstanding orders of removal, are subject to immediate removal. Others face an immigration hearing.The release brought particular attention to the sanctuary policies of California:While the vast majorities of cities in America do cooperate with ICE, state laws in California force ICE to focus additional resources to conduct at-large arrest in the community, putting officers, the general public and aliens at greater risk and increase the incidents of collateral arrests.“This week’s operation targeted public safety threats, such as convicted criminal aliens, individuals with final orders of removal, those who illegally re-entered the country after being removed, and individuals who have otherwise violated our nation’s immigration law,” said San Diego field office director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, (ERO) Greg Archambeault.Archambeault continued:Operations like this reflect the vital work ERO officers do every day to protect the nation, uphold public safety and protect the integrity of our immigration laws and border controls.  We will continue to conduct similar operations, while seeking to ultimately deport at-large criminal targets and other immigration fugitives who pose a threat to public safety.The arrests come shortly after ICE enforcement actions in northern California that saw 232 taken into custody. Ahead of the arrests, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf got wind of the planned arrests and alerted the region. Among those who had been targeted for arrest, but who evaded capture and may still be on the streets of America, were illegal aliens previously convicted of crimes including sex with a child, sodomy, DUI, and armed robbery.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/news/mccabe-kept-memos-on-trump-dealings-mueller-now-has-them/","WASHINGTON (AP) — Andrew McCabe, the onetime FBI deputy director long scorned by President Donald Trump and just fired by the attorney general, kept personal memos detailing interactions with the president that have been provided to the special counsel’s office and are similar to the notes compiled by dismissed FBI chief James Comey, The Associated Press has learned.The memos could factor into special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation as his team examines Trump campaign ties to Russia and possible obstruction of justice.McCabe’s memos include details of his own interactions with the president, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation who wasn’t authorized to discuss the notes publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. They also recount different conversations he had with Comey, who kept notes on meetings with Trump that unnerved him.Though the precise contents are unknown, the memos possibly could help substantiate McCabe’s assertion that he was unfairly maligned by a White House he says had declared “war” on the FBI and Mueller’s investigation. They almost certainly contain, as Comey’s memos did, previously undisclosed details about encounters between the Trump administration and FBI that could be of interest to Mueller.The disclosure Saturday came hours after Trump called McCabe’s firing by Attorney General Jeff Sessions “a great day for Democracy” and asserted without elaboration that McCabe knew “all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels off the FBI!” In the last year, Trump has repeatedly condemned as emblematic of an FBI that he insists is biased against his administration.That sent former CIA Director John Brennan, an outspoken Trump critic, into a Twitter tizzy: “When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history. You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America…America will triumph over you.”Sessions said he acted on the recommendation of FBI disciplinary officials who said McCabe had not been candid with a watchdog office investigation. McCabe was fired two days before his retirement date on Sunday. The dismissal likely jeopardizes his ability to collect his full pension benefits and, more broadly, could add to the turmoil that has enveloped the FBI since Comey’s firing and as the bureau moves ahead with an investigation the White House has dismissed as a hoax.An upcoming inspector general’s report is expected to conclude that McCabe, who spent more than 20 years with the FBI, had authorized the release of information to the media and was not forthcoming with the watchdog office as it examined the bureau’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation. McCabe has vigorously disputed the allegations and said his credibility had been attacked as “part of a larger effort not just to slander me personally” but also the FBI and law enforcement.“It is part of this administration’s ongoing war on the FBI and the efforts of the special counsel investigation, which continue to this day,” he added. “Their persistence in this campaign only highlights the importance of the special counsel’s work.”The firing set off dueling tweets between Trump, who called the termination a “great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI,” and Comey, the director he fired 10 months ago.Trump called Comey “sanctimonious” and said Comey made McCabe “look like a choirboy.” Comey, referencing his highly anticipated book that comes out next month, responded with his own tweet: “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Also Saturday, Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, cited the “brilliant and courageous example” by Sessions and the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility and said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein should “bring an end” to the Russia investigation “manufactured” by Comey.Dowd told the AP that he neither was calling on Rosenstein, who oversees Mueller’s inquiry, to fire the special counsel immediately nor had discussed with Rosenstein the idea of dismissing Mueller or ending the probe.Mueller is investigating whether Trump’s actions, including Comey’s ouster, constitute obstruction of justice. McCabe could be an important witness, and his memos could be used by investigators as they look into whether Trump sought to thwart the FBI probe. Comey’s own memos, including one in which he says Trump encouraged him to end an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, have been provided to Mueller and are part of his investigation.McCabe, in a statement defending himself, asserted he was singled out by the administration because of the “role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath” of Comey’s firing last May.He became acting director after that but clashed with the Trump administration, including when he publicly rejected White House assertions that Comey had lost the support of the rank-and-file. He abruptly left the deputy director position in January and went on leave.The firing arises from an inspector general review into how the FBI handled the Clinton email investigation. That inquiry focused not only on specific decisions made by FBI leadership but also on news media leaks.McCabe came under scrutiny over an October 2016 news report that revealed differing approaches within the FBI and Justice Department over how aggressively the Clinton Foundation should be investigated. The watchdog office has concluded that McCabe authorized FBI officials to speak to a Wall Street Journal reporter for that story and that McCabe had not been forthcoming with investigators. McCabe denies it.McCabe became entangled in presidential politics in 2016 after it was revealed that his wife, during her unsuccessful run for state Senate in Virginia one year earlier, received campaign contributions from the political action committee of then-Gov. Terry McAuliffe, D-Va., a longtime Clinton friend. The FBI has said McCabe received the necessary ethics approval about his wife’s candidacy and was not supervising the Clinton investigation at the time of the contributions.___Associated Press writer Chad Day contributed to this report.Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAPMOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/17/russiagate-collusion-theory-takes-blow-house-intelligence-committee-probe-ends/","The “Russiagate” collusion theory took a huge blow this week, as the House Intelligence Committee’s probe into Russia meddling came to an end.While the special counsel probe continues, the House Intelligence Committee’s conclusion of “no collusion” underscored the lack of any evidence to date of any such activities.“The collusion conspiracy theory is breaking down. There is no evidence of collusion at this point after year-plus investigations in the House and Senate. [Rep. Adam Schiff] claimed a year ago he had more than circumstantial evidence of collusion, but he still can’t produce it,” said a source involved in Congress’s Russia investigations.“And we’ve seen nothing on collusion from [special counsel Robert] Mueller. In addition, everyone now knows the Steele dossier is a fraud, and that the FBI was using it anyway. So the only thing sustaining the collusion narrative now is the media’s complicity in it.”Democrats on the committee complained they just were not allowed to dig deep enough — after more than a year of investigating and 73 witness interviews. They have vowed to keep investigating, although without the power to compel witnesses or documents, it is hard to imagine they will make much progress.And they continue to argue that disparate incidents amounted to collusion — a London professor telling Trump volunteer campaign aide George Papadopoulos that the Russians had thousands of emails that were embarrassing to Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump Jr. showing receptivity by accepting a meeting with a Russian lawyer who purportedly had dirt on Clinton.But the lead Republican on the House Intelligence Committee’s Russia probe, Rep. Mike Conaway (R-TX), dismissed that idea, telling reporters after the committee’s conclusion was announced:Only Tom Clancy or Vince Flynn or someone else like that could take this series of inadvertent contacts with each other, or meetings, whatever, and weave that into some sort of a fictional page-turner spy thriller. But we’re not dealing with fiction, we’re dealing with facts. And we found no evidence of any collusion, of anything that people were actually doing, other than taking a meeting they shouldn’t have taken or inadvertently being in the same building.Perhaps the biggest blow to Democrats is the loss of the probe as a political vehicle ahead of the 2018 midterm elections.The House Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), had become a cable news fixture talking about Russia collusion and suspected leaker to CNN about the probe. The RNC tracked Schiff’s TV interviews in the last 13 months about the probe at 227.“It’s not shocking that the person most upset by the outcome had used the investigation to launch his TV career,” Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens told the Washington Examiner.Schiff also tried to fundraise off of the Russia probe, claiming in one campaign ad that Trump and his “friends at Breitbart” were going after him.Although the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees continue their investigations, the top Democrats on those committees have been nowhere near as vocal or partisan. And there are no signs that either committee has found any collusion yet. In October, Senate Intelligence Committee chairman Richard Burr (R-NC) told reporters that he had no “initial findings” on collusion, ten months after the investigation began.Contrary to Trump critics’ fears and accusations, the end of the House probe does not appear to affect the special counsel’s investigation. According to the New York Times, Mueller opened a new avenue of inquiry in recent weeks, requesting all documents related to Russia from the Trump Organization, despite the president’s warning Mueller to stay out of his finances.But Andrew McCarthy, senior fellow at the National Review and a former prosecutor, said any evidence of collusion found by the special counsel would have likely leaked by now. He also noted that indictments against former National Security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, his business associate Rick Gates, and former volunteer campaign adviser George Papadopoulos have not been related to collusion.“If you look at the charging instruments that Mueller has filed, the indictments and information that’s come out, the guilty pleas that have come out,” he said, “he’s even got guys who clearly have connections with Russia, like Papadopoulos and Flynn and Manafort and Gates, and there’s not a whisper in any of these charges that there was a conspiracy between Trump and Russia.”The ending of the House Intelligence Committee probe could mean a second special counsel, however, now that House Republican lawmakers have more time to investigate potential misbehavior at the Justice Department and the FBI.House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) has said the committee will continue to investigate FISA abuse, the unmasking of Americans’ names in intelligence reports, the origins and use of the Trump dossier, and intelligence community leaks.Additionally, Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), House Intelligence Committee member and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, recently requested — along with House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) — that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appoint a second special counsel.That request has now been echoed by four senators, including the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, increasing the chances that it will happen, or that a DOJ prosecutor will be assigned to investigate the matter.A second special counsel could ensure that any investigation into the DOJ and FBI continues, even if Democrats take the House in the 2018 midterm elections, which, historically, they are favored to do, as the opposing party of an incumbent president.However, the pressure is on House Republicans to do as much as they can before that might happen, McCarthy noted.“There’s a limited number of legislative days that they have left in an election year,” he said. “If they lose control of the House, the investigation’s over because the Democrats will kill the investigation.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

She came to be known as “Abortion Barbie” by conservative media.Davis’s filibuster took the state Senate into recess, but then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry called a special legislative session to complete passage of the bill and signed it into law.Subsequently, Davis ran for governor, but was never a true contender and ultimately lost her bid by 20 percentage points to current Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R). During the campaign, the news was filled with what eventually came to be recognized as Davis’s fictional accounts of her life and her flip-flopping on key issues – even abortion.In January 2014, Davis admitted she lied about important life events, including her divorce, and – one year later – also admitted she was faking her support for gun rights to boost her chances in her gubernatorial bid.In February 2014 – just half a year after her famous filibuster – Davis told the Dallas Morning News she supported bans on abortion after 20 weeks. The news was not a complete shock, since several months earlier Davis had also described herself as “pro-life.”Davis now heads up Deeds Not Words, a group that aims to advance feminist goals. On the organization’s website, Davis portrays herself as a struggling single mother who juggled going to school and having a career.In January, current Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards announced she would be leaving her leadership role. The announcement came just one month after the U.S. Department of Justice confirmed it was launching an investigation into the abortion vendor following allegations of profiting from the sales of the body parts of aborted babies.Planned Parenthood’s latest annual report shows a decline in many of whatever actual health care services are offered in its clinics, while its profits – driven by abortions performed – have risen dramatically.“Under the leadership of Cecile Richards, Planned Parenthood has grown to push one agenda – abortion above all else – while throwing aside any inkling of actual medical care,” Penny Nance, CEO and president of Concerned Women for America, said in a statement sent to Breitbart News.The organization’s “abortion above all else” narrative made headlines recently when Planned Parenthood condemned the House’s approval of a bill that would require abortionists to immediately provide emergency medical care to an infant born alive during an abortion.Nance also observed that, during Richards’ tenure, Planned Parenthood “has been exposed for refusing to report statutory rape and abuse, for aiding sex traffickers, for taking money to abort black babies, and for illegally profiting off of the body parts they have aborted.”The conservative women’s leader suggested that Planned Parenthood can no longer afford to prop up its old narrative that it provides women’s health care.“If Planned Parenthood is serious about standing up for the women they claim to represent, they will hire someone who understands medicine and accepts the facts that abortion does not help women, but only inflicts harm and destruction,” she said. “This is their chance to turn the organization around for the good and actually help women, instead of constantly telling them they cannot fulfill their dreams without abortion.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Initial reports state that it is unclear how Lamo died, but Wichita Police Officer Charley Davidson stated that there was “nothing suspicious about his death.”Lamo’s friend Lorraine Murphy told the Wichita Eagle that she spoke to Lamo in December 2016 and asked how he was doing, Lamo replied that he was “homeless in Wichita.” Murphy stated “Adrian was always homeless or on the verge of it. He bounced around a great deal, for no particular reason.” She continued to say “He was a believer in the Geographic Cure. Whatever goes wrong in your life, moving will make it better. And he knew people all over the country.” Murphy stated that Lamo often received death threats due to his hacking but Officer Davidson stated that there was “no indication foul play is involved in Lamo’s death.”Manning was arrested in 2013 for the leaking of classified government documents. Manning served 7 years of a 35-year sentence as her sentence was commuted by President Obama. Manning was released from prison in May 2017. Manning has since announced plans to run in Maryland for the seat of Democratic Senator Ben Cardin. Lamo testified that Manning contacted him about his hacking skills after he was featured in an article published by the Guardian. Lamo stated that he thought about Manning “every day,” and that “the decision was not one I decided to make, but was thrust upon me.”Lamo’s father commented on his son’s death on Facebook stating, “With great sadness and a broken heart I have to let know all of Adrian’s friends and acquaintances [sic] that he is dead.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/trump-mueller.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump on Sunday abandoned a strategy of showing deference to the special counsel examining Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election, lashing out at what he characterized as a partisan investigation and alarming Republicans who feared he might seek to shut it down.Mr. Trump has long suggested that allegations that he or his campaign conspired with Russia to influence the election were a “hoax” and part of a “witch hunt,” but until this weekend he had largely heeded the advice of lawyers who counseled him not to directly attack Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, for fear of antagonizing prosecutors.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. “Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!”The attack on Mr. Mueller, a longtime Republican and former F.B.I. director appointed by a Republican president, George W. Bush, drew immediate rebukes from some members of the party who expressed concern that it might presage an effort to fire the special counsel. Such a move, they warned, would give the appearance of a corrupt attempt to short-circuit the investigation and set off a bipartisan backlash.“If he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, because we’re a rule-of-law nation,” Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an ally of the president, said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “When it comes to Mr. Mueller, he is following the evidence where it takes him, and I think it’s very important he be allowed to do his job without interference, and there are many Republicans who share my view.”Among them was Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a sharp critic of Mr. Trump who appeared on the same program. “People see that as a massive red line that can’t be crossed,” he said. He urged Mr. Trump’s advisers to prevail on him not to fire Mr. Mueller. “We have confidence in Mueller.”Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina, said if the president was innocent, he should “act like it” and leave Mr. Mueller alone, warning of dire repercussions if the president tried to fire the special counsel.“I would just counsel the president — it’s going to be a very, very long, bad 2018, and it’s going to be distracting from other things that he wants to do and he was elected do,” Mr. Gowdy said on “Fox News Sunday.” “Let it play out its course. If you’ve done nothing wrong, you should want the investigation to be as fulsome and thorough as possible.”The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, issued a statement likewise warning Mr. Trump to back off. “As the speaker has always said, Mr. Mueller and his team should be able to do their job,” said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman. His counterpart, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, had no comment, as did a number of other top Senate Republicans.Late in the day, the White House tried to douse the furor. “In response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the administration, the White House yet again confirms that the president is not considering or discussing the firing of the special counsel, Robert Mueller,” Ty Cobb, a White House lawyer, said in a statement.The president’s tweet followed a statement by Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, on Saturday calling on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Trump followed up that evening with a tweet arguing that “the Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime.”The two weekend tweets were the first time Mr. Trump has used Mr. Mueller’s name on Twitter, not counting a message he once retweeted, and reflected what advisers called a growing impatience fueled by anger that the investigation was now looking at his business activities.The New York Times reported last week that Mr. Mueller has subpoenaed records from the Trump Organization. Mr. Trump’s lawyers met with Mr. Mueller’s team last week and received more details about how the special counsel is approaching the investigation, including the scope of his interest in the Trump Organization.For months, Mr. Trump had been reassured by his lawyers that the investigation would wrap up soon — by Thanksgiving, then Christmas, then New Year’s. But with the expansion into Mr. Trump’s business, it seems increasingly clear that Mr. Mueller is not ready to conclude his inquiry.A top adviser to Mr. Trump said on Sunday that the White House had grown weary of the inquiry. “We have cooperated in every single way, every single paper they’ve asked for, every single interview,” Marc Short, the president’s legislative director, said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “There’s a growing frustration that after a year and millions and millions of dollars spent on this, there remains no evidence of collusion with Russia.”A president cannot directly fire a special counsel but can order his attorney general to do so. Even then, a cause has to be cited, like conflict of interest. Since Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a former campaign adviser, has recused himself from the Russia investigation — to Mr. Trump’s continuing irritation — the task would fall to the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein.But Mr. Rosenstein said as recently as last week that he sees no justification for firing Mr. Mueller, meaning that he would either have to change his mind or be removed himself. The third-ranking official at the Justice Department, Rachel Brand, knowing this issue could reach her, decided last month to step down. The next official in line would be the solicitor general, Noel J. Francisco, a former White House and Justice Department lawyer under Mr. Bush.Mr. Trump sought to have Mr. Mueller fired last June but backed down after his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, threatened to quit. The president told The Times a month later that Mr. Mueller would be crossing a red line if he looked into his family’s finances beyond any relationship with Russia.The White House made no assertion last week that the subpoena to the Trump Organization crossed that red line, but Mr. Trump evidently has grown tired of the strategy of being respectful to the special counsel. His focus on Democrats working for Mr. Mueller could be aimed at demonstrating conflict of interest that would merit dismissal.When Mr. Mueller assembled his team, he surrounded himself with trusted former colleagues and experts on specific crimes like money laundering. As the team filled out, Republican allies of Mr. Trump noted that some members had previously contributed to Democratic candidates.In particular, Republicans pointed to Andrew Weissmann, who served as F.B.I. general counsel under Mr. Mueller. Mr. Weissmann is a career prosecutor but, while in private law practice, donated thousands of dollars toward President Barack Obama’s election effort.In his Sunday morning Twitter blasts, Mr. Trump also renewed his attacks on James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and Andrew G. McCabe, his former deputy, both of whom, like Mr. Mueller, are longtime Republicans. Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey last May, at first attributing the decision to the F.B.I. director’s handling of the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server but later telling an interviewer that he had the Russia investigation in mind when he made the decision.Mr. Sessions, under intense public pressure from Mr. Trump, fired Mr. McCabe on Friday after an inspector general found that he had not been forthcoming about authorizing F.B.I. officials to provide information about the Clinton inquiry in 2016 to a reporter.“Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked ‘have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?’” Mr. Trump wrote. “He said strongly ‘never, no.’ He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.”Mr. Trump went on to dismiss reports that Mr. McCabe kept detailed memos of his time as deputy F.B.I. director, just as Mr. Comey did. Mr. McCabe left those memos with the F.B.I., which means Mr. Mueller’s team has access to them.“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Michael R. Bromwich, Mr. McCabe’s lawyer, fired back by accusing the president of corrupting the law enforcement system. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” he wrote on Twitter. “The whole truth will come out in due course. But the tweets confirm that he has corrupted the entire process that led to Mr. McCabe’s termination and has rendered it illegitimate.”In suggesting that Mr. Comey lied under oath to Congress, Mr. Trump appeared to refer to a comment by Mr. McCabe that the former director had authorized the news media interaction at the heart of the complaint against him. The president’s Republican allies picked up the point on Sunday and pressed for appointment of a prosecutor to look at the origin of the Russia investigation.“So we know that McCabe has lied” because the inspector general concluded he had not been fully candid, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House majority leader, said on Fox News. “Now he’s saying about Comey — Comey may have lied as well. So I don’t think this is the end of it. But that’s why we need a second special counsel.”Other Republicans, however, suggested that the Trump administration was going too far. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida criticized the decision to fire Mr. McCabe on a Friday night shortly before his retirement took effect, jeopardizing his pension.“I don’t like the way it happened,” Mr. Rubio said on “Meet the Press” on NBC. “He should’ve been allowed to finish through the weekend.” Speaking of the president, he added: “Obviously he doesn’t like McCabe and he’s made that pretty clear now for over a year. We need to be very careful about taking these very important entities and smearing everybody in them with a broad stroke.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/trump-tweets-mueller.html","For months, President Trump’s legal advisers implored him to avoid so much as mentioning the name of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, in his tweets, and to do nothing to provoke him or suggest his investigation is not proper.Ignoring that advice over the weekend was the decision of a president who ultimately trusts only his own instincts, and now believes he has settled into the job enough to rely on them rather than the people who advise him.A dozen people close to Mr. Trump or the White House, including current and former aides and longtime friends, described him as newly emboldened to say what he really feels and to ignore the cautions of those around him.That self-confidence has led to a series of surprising comments and actions that have pushed the Trump presidency in an ever more tumultuous direction.Long wary about publicly expressing his belief in the death penalty for drug dealers, he proposed it at a rally in Pennsylvania. “Probably you will have some people that say that’s not nice,” he said.He bragged about making up an assertion in a conversation with the leader of a close ally, Canada, and called a reporter a “son of a bitch.”He barreled ahead with a plan to meet with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un, to the dismay of much of the diplomatic corps.He vanquished the economic aides he had previously seen as having more stature than he did by announcing he would go ahead with tariffs on certain imports, alarming key allies.And then this weekend he seemed to raise the possibility of dismissing Mr. Mueller.“This could be the manifestation of growing confidence,” said Roger J. Stone Jr., one of the president’s oldest confidantes.Projecting strength, control and power, whether as a New York developer or domineering reality television host, has always been vital to Mr. Trump. But in his first year in the White House, according to his friends, he found himself feeling tentative and anxious, intimidated by the role of president, a fact that he never openly admitted but that they could sense, people close to the president said.This, after all, is someone for whom leaving the security of Trump Tower and moving to Washington and the White House was a daunting prospect. Even now, as he has grown more comfortable in the job, he rarely leaves the White House unless he is certain the environment will be friendly, such as at one of his own properties. Rallies are rarely scheduled in areas that could invite large protests.For months, aides were mostly able to redirect a neophyte president with warnings about the consequences of his actions, and mostly control his public behavior.Those most able to influence him were John F. Kelly, the retired Marine general turned chief of staff, and Gary D. Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive and director of the National Economic Council. And few people had more ability to blunt the president’s potentially self-destructive impulses than Hope Hicks, his communications director, who has been one of his closest advisers since the earliest days of his 2016 campaign.Some of Mr. Trump’s allies have said that Mr. Trump was trapped in a West Wing cage built by Mr. Kelly, and has finally broken loose.The reality is more complicated, his closest aides say. They say Mr. Trump now feels he doesn’t need the expertise of Mr. Kelly, Mr. Cohn or Rex W. Tillerson, the former Exxon Mobil executive he made secretary of state. If he once suspected they were smarter or better equipped to lead the country and protect his presidency, he doesn’t believe that now.Two of those men are now on their way out. And Mr. Trump has an ambiguous relationship with the third, Mr. Kelly, whom he alternately assures that his job is secure and disparages to other people. Ms. Hicks is leaving the White House in the coming days, a departure that has caused concern among his allies about how he will cope without her in the long term.Outside the White House, there are few friends the president will listen to. Some of them warned him to back off his tariffs plan, telling him that he would undo what he had accomplished with the tax bill. Mr. Trump said he didn’t agree, and that was that.But Mr. Trump’s moods have always been like storm clouds passing quickly over a desert island, and aides say that has not changed. Contrary to descriptions of a constantly fuming, beleaguered president, friends and advisers say Mr. Trump is more at ease than he has been in some time. What seems like unchecked chaos to almost everyone else is Mr. Trump feeling he is in his element.“He seems more relaxed, believe it or not,” said Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who spent several hours with the president during two St. Patrick’s Day events on Thursday.“I would say it’s a combination of being more relaxed and also being frustrated by the fact that he feels like a lot of what he didn’t succeed at, or what hasn’t worked, is that he wasn’t allowed to be Trump,” he said.His close allies, like Representative Mark Meadows, the North Carolina Republican who is the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, believe the president is finding his stride and learning how to navigate Washington.“I see it more as a function of just, ‘O.K., I’ve taken a year to understand the different dynamics within a broad array of personalities,’ and so now it’s all about putting together a team to go the distance for the next three years,” Mr. Meadows said.Perhaps.Warnings of dire consequences from his critics have failed to materialize. When Mr. Cohn announced that he was resigning, the predictions were that the stock market would plummet. There was only a minor dip by the end of the next day.And on North Korea, even the grayest of foreign policy beards have conceded that Mr. Trump might be able to accomplish something.“The president has his own original style, and it’s unlikely to be changed at this stage of his life,” Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, said in an interview. “But it also is conducive to bringing forward opportunities like this Korean conversation. It is not what we traditionalists would have recommended in the first place.“But I have to say, when I have thought it through, and how it could play out, it could restore a political initiative to us, and could compel a conversation with countries” otherwise disinclined.Some worried aides are less sanguine. They view the weekend’s attacks on Mr. Mueller and the F.B.I. as a particularly disturbing taste of what they believe could come. They say privately that Mr. Trump does not understand the job the way he believes he does, and that they fear he will become even less inclined to take advice.It remains to be seen whether his attacks on Mr. Mueller are anything more than an effort to define the terms of the public conversation about the investigation, and the parameters of an interview with the president that the special counsel is seeking.But the possibility that Mr. Trump would be emboldened enough to fire Mr. Mueller was raised on Sunday by Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.Such a move, Mr. Graham said on CNN, would be “the beginning of the end” of the Trump presidency.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html","(After this story was published, Facebook came under harsh criticism from lawmakers in the United States and Britain. Read the latest.)LONDON — As the upstart voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica prepared to wade into the 2014 American midterm elections, it had a problem.The firm had secured a $15 million investment from Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and wooed his political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, with the promise of tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior. But it did not have the data to make its new products work.So the firm harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history. The breach allowed the company to exploit the private social media activity of a huge swath of the American electorate, developing techniques that underpinned its work on President Trump’s campaign in 2016.An examination by The New York Times and The Observer of London reveals how Cambridge Analytica’s drive to bring to market a potentially powerful new weapon put the firm — and wealthy conservative investors seeking to reshape politics — under scrutiny from investigators and lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic.Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge and worked there until late 2014, said of its leaders: “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair.”“They want to fight a culture war in America,” he added. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”Details of Cambridge’s acquisition and use of Facebook data have surfaced in several accounts since the business began working on the 2016 campaign, setting off a furious debate about the merits of the firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques.But the full scale of the data leak involving Americans has not been previously disclosed — and Facebook, until now, has not acknowledged it. Interviews with a half-dozen former employees and contractors, and a review of the firm’s emails and documents, have revealed that Cambridge not only relied on the private Facebook data but still possesses most or all of the trove.Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.“This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees.Congressional investigators have questioned Mr. Nix about the company’s role in the Trump campaign. And the Justice Department’s special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has  demanded the emails of Cambridge Analytica employees who worked for the Trump team as part of his investigation into Russian interference in the election.While the substance of Mr. Mueller’s interest is a closely guarded secret, documents viewed by The Times indicate that the firm’s British affiliate claims to have worked in Russia and Ukraine. And the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, disclosed in October that Mr. Nix had reached out to him during the campaign in hopes of obtaining private emails belonging to Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.The documents also raise new questions about Facebook, which is already grappling with intense criticism over the spread of Russian propaganda and fake news. The data Cambridge collected from profiles, a portion of which was viewed by The Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” Only a tiny fraction of the users had agreed to release their information to a third party.“Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Grewal said. “No systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.”Still, he added, “it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”Reading Voters’ MindsThe Bordeaux flowed freely as Mr. Nix and several colleagues sat down for dinner at the Palace Hotel in Manhattan in late 2013, Mr. Wylie recalled in an interview. They had much to celebrate.Mr. Nix, a brash salesman, led the small elections division at SCL Group, a political and defense contractor. He had spent much of the year trying to break into the lucrative new world of political data, recruiting Mr. Wylie, then a 24-year-old political operative with ties to veterans of President Obama’s campaigns. Mr. Wylie was interested in using inherent psychological traits to affect voters’ behavior and had assembled a team of psychologists and data scientists, some of them affiliated with Cambridge University.The group experimented abroad, including in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules were lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL were happy to provide government-held data, former employees said.Then a chance meeting brought Mr. Nix into contact with Mr. Bannon, the Breitbart News firebrand who would later become a Trump campaign and White House adviser, and with Mr. Mercer, one of the richest men on earth.Mr. Nix and his colleagues courted Mr. Mercer, who believed a sophisticated data company could make him a kingmaker in Republican politics, and his daughter Rebekah, who shared his conservative views. Mr. Bannon was intrigued by the possibility of using personality profiling to shift America’s culture and rewire its politics, recalled Mr. Wylie and other former employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they had signed nondisclosure agreements. Mr. Bannon and the Mercers declined to comment.Mr. Mercer agreed to help finance a $1.5 million pilot project to poll voters and test psychographic messaging in Virginia’s gubernatorial race in November 2013, where the Republican attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, ran against Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic fund-raiser. Though Mr. Cuccinelli lost, Mr. Mercer committed to moving forward.The Mercers wanted results quickly, and more business beckoned. In early 2014, the investor Toby Neugebauer and other wealthy conservatives were preparing to put tens of millions of dollars behind a presidential campaign for Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, work that Mr. Nix was eager to win.When Mr. Wylie’s colleagues failed to produce a memo explaining their work to Mr. Neugebauer, Mr. Nix castigated them over email.“ITS 2 PAGES!! 4 hours work max (or an hour each). What have you all been doing??” he wrote.Mr. Wylie’s team had a bigger problem. Building psychographic profiles on a national scale required data the company could not gather without huge expense. Traditional analytics firms used voting records and consumer purchase histories to try to predict political beliefs and voting behavior.But those kinds of records were useless for figuring out whether a particular voter was, say, a neurotic introvert, a religious extrovert, a fair-minded liberal or a fan of the occult. Those were among the psychological traits the firm claimed would provide a uniquely powerful means of designing political messages.Mr. Wylie found a solution at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre. Researchers there had developed a technique to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook. The researchers paid users small sums to take a personality quiz and download an app, which would scrape some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time. The approach, the scientists said, could reveal more about a person than their parents or romantic partners knew — a claim that has been disputed.When the Psychometrics Centre declined to work with the firm, Mr. Wylie found someone who would: Dr. Kogan, who was then a psychology professor at the university and knew of the techniques. Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica. The business covered the costs — more than $800,000 — and allowed him to keep a copy for his own research, according to company emails and financial records.All he divulged to Facebook, and to users in fine print, was that he was collecting information for academic purposes, the social network said. It did not verify his claim. Dr. Kogan declined to provide details of what happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, though he maintained that his program was “a very standard vanilla Facebook app.”He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, Mr. Wylie said, a number confirmed by a company email and a former colleague. Of those, roughly 30 million — a number previously reported by The Intercept — contained enough information, including places of residence, that the company could match users to other records and build psychographic profiles. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested.Mr. Wylie said the Facebook data was “the saving grace” that let his team deliver the models it had promised the Mercers.“We wanted as much as we could get,” he acknowledged. “Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking.”Mr. Nix tells a different story. Appearing before a parliamentary committee last month, he described Dr. Kogan’s contributions as “fruitless.”An International EffortJust as Dr. Kogan’s efforts were getting underway, Mr. Mercer agreed to invest $15 million in a joint venture with SCL’s elections division. The partners devised a convoluted corporate structure, forming a new American company, owned almost entirely by Mr. Mercer, with a license to the psychographics platform developed by Mr. Wylie’s team, according to company documents. Mr. Bannon, who became a board member and investor, chose the name: Cambridge Analytica.The firm was effectively a shell. According to the documents and former employees, any contracts won by Cambridge, originally incorporated in Delaware, would be serviced by London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, a British citizen who held dual appointments at Cambridge Analytica and SCL. Most SCL employees and contractors were Canadian, like Mr. Wylie, or European.But in July 2014, an American election lawyer advising the company, Laurence Levy, warned that the arrangement could violate laws limiting the involvement of foreign nationals in American elections.In a memo to Mr. Bannon, Ms. Mercer and Mr. Nix, the lawyer, then at the firm Bracewell & Giuliani, warned that Mr. Nix would have to recuse himself “from substantive management” of any clients involved in United States elections. The data firm would also have to find American citizens or green card holders, Mr. Levy wrote, “to manage the work and decision making functions, relative to campaign messaging and expenditures.”In summer and fall 2014, Cambridge Analytica dived into the American midterm elections, mobilizing SCL contractors and employees around the country. Few Americans were involved in the work, which included polling, focus groups and message development for the John Bolton Super PAC, conservative groups in Colorado and the campaign of Senator Thom Tillis, the North Carolina Republican.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement to The Times, said that all “personnel in strategic roles were U.S. nationals or green card holders.” Mr. Nix “never had any strategic or operational role” in an American election campaign, the company said.Whether the company’s American ventures violated election laws would depend on foreign employees’ roles in each campaign, and on whether their work counted as strategic advice under Federal Election Commission rules.Cambridge Analytica appears to have exhibited a similar pattern in the 2016 election cycle, when the company worked for the campaigns of Mr. Cruz and then Mr. Trump. While Cambridge hired more Americans to work on the races that year, most of its data scientists were citizens of the United Kingdom or other European countries, according to two former employees.Under the guidance of Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s digital director in 2016 and now the campaign manager for his 2020 re-election effort, Cambridge performed a variety of services, former campaign officials said. That included designing target audiences for digital ads and fund-raising appeals, modeling voter turnout, buying $5 million in television ads and determining where Mr. Trump should travel to best drum up support.Cambridge executives have offered conflicting accounts about the use of psychographic data on the campaign. Mr. Nix has said that the firm’s profiles helped shape Mr. Trump’s strategy — statements disputed by other campaign officials — but also that Cambridge did not have enough time to comprehensively model Trump voters.In a BBC interview last December, Mr. Nix said that the Trump efforts drew on “legacy psychographics” built for the Cruz campaign.After the LeakBy early 2015, Mr. Wylie and more than half his original team of about a dozen people had left the company. Most were liberal-leaning, and had grown disenchanted with working on behalf of the hard-right candidates the Mercer family favored.Cambridge Analytica, in its statement, said that Mr. Wylie had left to start a rival firm, and that it later took legal action against him to enforce intellectual property claims. It characterized Mr. Wylie and other former “contractors” as engaging in “what is clearly a malicious attempt to hurt the company.”Near the end of that year, a report in The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica was using private Facebook data on the Cruz campaign, sending Facebook scrambling. In a statement at the time, Facebook promised that it was “carefully investigating this situation” and would require any company misusing its data to destroy it.Facebook verified the leak and — without publicly acknowledging it — sought to secure the information, efforts that continued as recently as August 2016. That month, lawyers for the social network reached out to Cambridge Analytica contractors. “This data was obtained and used without permission,” said a letter that was obtained by the Times. “It cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately.”Mr. Grewal, the Facebook deputy general counsel, said in a statement that both Dr. Kogan and “SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”But copies of the data still remain beyond Facebook’s control. The Times viewed a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.While Mr. Nix has told lawmakers that the company does not have Facebook data, a former employee said that he had recently seen hundreds of gigabytes on Cambridge servers, and that the files were not encrypted.Today, as Cambridge Analytica seeks to expand its business in the United States and overseas, Mr. Nix has mentioned some questionable practices. This January, in undercover footage filmed by Channel 4 News in Britain and viewed by The Times, he boasted of employing front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients around the world, and even suggested ways to entrap politicians in compromising situations.All the scrutiny appears to have damaged Cambridge Analytica’s political business. No American campaigns or “super PACs” have yet reported paying the company for work in the 2018 midterms, and it is unclear whether Cambridge will be asked to join Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign.In the meantime, Mr. Nix is seeking to take psychographics to the commercial advertising market. He has repositioned himself as a guru for the digital ad age — a “Math Man,” he puts it. In the United States last year, a former employee said, Cambridge pitched Mercedes-Benz, MetLife and the brewer AB InBev, but has not signed them on.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/nyregion/cuomo-leads-cynthia-nixon-and-gop-hopefuls-in-2018-re-election-poll.html","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is entering his re-election campaign with a commanding lead over both his Republican rivals and a possible Democratic primary opponent, the actress Cynthia Nixon, according to a new poll from Siena College.The survey shows Mr. Cuomo ahead of Ms. Nixon among Democratic voters by 66 percent to 19 percent. He leads her by a wide margin among every subgroup in the survey: men and women, moderates and liberals, black, white and Latino voters, upstate and New York City residents.Best known for her role in “Sex and the City,” Ms. Nixon entered the contest only Monday, after the poll had been completed, but had said she was exploring a bid and had been in contact with political strategists with experience running progressive campaigns. A longtime education activist in the state, Ms. Nixon has the benefit of name recognition, and yet remains broadly unknown to voters, with 60 percent saying they had no opinion of her.The poll showed Mr. Cuomo with a two-to-one advantage over both his potential Republican challengers, State Senator John DeFrancisco and Marc Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, who is expected to formally declare his candidacy at the beginning of April.Mr. Cuomo had a 52 percent approval rating in the survey, essentially unchanged from a month earlier.The survey was conducted as the two-month corruption trial of one of Mr. Cuomo’s former top aides, Joseph Percoco, ended in a guilty verdict last week. Mr. Cuomo and his team regularly emphasized that the governor himself was not charged with wrongdoing in the case.The State Democratic Party also spent $100,000 last week, while the poll was being conducted, on a television ad in the New York City area promoting Mr. Cuomo’s record on gun control.“Mostly, this survey provides the governor with good news,” said Steven Greenberg, who conducted the poll.Mr. Greenberg noted that Mr. Cuomo’s job-approval rating did slide to 42 percent, with the percentage of New York voters who said he was doing a poor job rising to 25 percent, equaling the high in a Siena College poll.Since his 2014 re-election, Mr. Cuomo has tacked to the left politically, passing an increase in the minimum wage, paid family leave and other measures as his political operation has tried to rebrand him as a progressive after a first term in which he emphasized governing from the political center.In the poll, more New Yorkers, 46 percent, rated Mr. Cuomo as a “liberal” than in any past survey. That is more than double the 21 percent who said in February 2011, his second month in office, that he was a liberal.But among Democratic voters, a majority, 52 percent, still viewed Mr. Cuomo as a moderate, compared with only 34 percent of Democrats who labeled him a liberal.Should she run, Ms. Nixon is expected to challenge Mr. Cuomo from the political left. She has been in talks with former advisers to Mayor Bill de Blasio, Bill Hyers and Rebecca Katz, two architects of his 2013 mayoral bid.“One of the ideas that’s out there, that’s floating among the chattering class is that Cuomo has a problem with liberals,” Mr. Greenberg said. “That’s a canard. The truth is Cuomo has a problem with liberal leadership.”Over all, Mr. Cuomo’s standing heading into his re-election year appears to have slightly deteriorated from four years ago.In March 2014, a Siena College survey had 49 percent of New York voters saying they intended to vote to re-elect Mr. Cuomo, with 41 percent saying they preferred an alternative.This month’s poll showed a 48-percent-to-46-percent split on the same question.The statewide poll was conducted from March 11 to 16, with 772 registered New York voters, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The sample of Democrats included 358 voters, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 6 percentage points. Mr. Greenberg noted that it was not a sample of likely Democratic primary voters.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-new-hampshire-opioid-plan.html","President Trump on Monday will make his first visit to New Hampshire since the 2016 campaign to unveil a plan to combat the opioid epidemic in a state with the nation’s third-highest rate of deaths from overdoses.In addition to reducing the supply of illicit drugs with better interdiction and tougher penalties, the plan calls for reducing opioid prescriptions and overall demand for opioids, and expanding access to treatment and recovery tools like the overdose-reversing drug naloxone.Mr. Trump is not specifying how much he thinks should be spent on the plan, which White House officials said was based on recommendations from the opioid commission he appointed last year. Congress recently allotted $6 billion to address the epidemic over the next two years, which public health experts have described as a good start but not anywhere near enough.Drug overdoses killed roughly 64,000 people in the United States in 2016, according to initial estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and have become the leading cause of death for Americans under 50. The agency also reported last month that emergency room visits for suspected opioid overdoses increased by 30 percent from July 2016 through September 2017.On a call with reporters on Sunday afternoon to describe the plan, White House officials said the administration will seek the death penalty in the case of certain drug traffickers — not dealers as Mr. Trump had said at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month.“The Department of Justice will seek the death penalty against drug traffickers when it’s appropriate under current law,” Andrew Bremberg, who leads the Domestic Policy Council, said on the briefing call.White House officials would not answer what type of hypothetical case would involve the death penalty, referring questions to the Justice Department. Mr. Trump will also urge Congress to lower the threshold to use mandatory minimum sentences on opioid dealers, and will look for tougher criminal sentences on traffickers of certain drugs, such as fentanyl.Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor who has been the point person within the West Wing on the issue, cited grim statistics on the impact of opioids.“More than 115 people a day die from opioid-related drug overdoses in this country, and in 2016, opioid overdose deaths surpassed breast cancer deaths,” she said. “Nine out of 10 new heroin users begin through an opioid prescription.”The plan seeks to cut the number of opioid prescriptions filled by a third within three years, a restriction that will face opposition from critics who argue it could have unintended consequences for people with chronic and even acute pain, and that it instead could force some users to seek more dangerous drugs, like heroin and synthetic fentanyl.Officials were vague about how the administration would reduce prescriptions, saying only that a main goal would be for prescribers for Medicaid, Medicare and other federal health programs to follow guidelines that the C.D.C. published two years ago. Those guidelines recommended that doctors first try ibuprofen and aspirin to treat pain, and that opioid treatment for short-term pain last no more than a week.On addiction treatment, the plan includes little besides a vague goal of expanding access to “evidence-based addiction treatment” in every state, particularly for members of the military, veterans and their families and for people leaving jail or prison. Echoing public health experts, a White House official on Sunday’s conference call described the three medications used to blunt opioid cravings — buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone — as “the gold standard.”Mr. Trump has declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency and proposed, in his budget plan last month, spending $10 billion on the epidemic over the next two fiscal years.But the president also called for repealing the Affordable Care Act, which expanded Medicaid to cover much of the addiction treatment provided around the United States over the last few years.Congress has already allotted $6 billion for fighting the epidemic over the next two years, but is still working out how exactly the money will be spent.In the meantime, the 21st Century Cures Act, signed by President Barack Obama in 2016, is providing $1 billion through the end of 2018 for prevention and treatment. In comparison, the federal government spent about $21 billion in the 2017 fiscal year on domestic care and treatment for H.I.V. and AIDS.The president will be heading to a key early primary state that handed him his first primary victory in 2016. Other Republicans who are considering challenges to the president have already started visiting the New Hampshire.Mr. Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, will be in Iowa on Monday, and the Trump campaign recently announced a campaign manager, Brad Parscale.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/joseph-digenova-trump-lawyer.html","MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Trump hired the longtime Washington lawyer Joseph E. diGenova on Monday, adding an aggressive voice to his legal team who has pushed the theory on television that the F.B.I. and Justice Department framed Mr. Trump.Mr. diGenova, a former United States attorney, is not expected to take a lead role. But he will serve as an outspoken player for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump broke over the weekend from the longstanding advice of some of his lawyers that he refrain from directly criticizing Mr. Mueller, a sign of his growing unease with the investigation.“Former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Joe DiGenova will be joining our legal team later this week,” said Jay Sekulow, one of the president’s personal lawyers. “I have worked with Joe for many years and have full confidence that he will be a great asset in our representation of the President.”Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president. “There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he said on Fox News in January. He added, “Make no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.”Little evidence has emerged to support that theory.Mr. Trump’s legal team has been in tumult in recent weeks. On Saturday, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, John Dowd, called on the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at the time that he was speaking for the president but later backtracked. According to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president’s urging to call for an end to the inquiry.Earlier this month, Mr. Trump did not tell his lawyers that he was in discussions with another Washington lawyer, Emmet T. Flood, about representing him. Mr. Flood represented former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment proceedings.Mr. diGenova did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. Ms. Toensing has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.Ms. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president’s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who supposedly had damaging information Hillary Clinton.Mr. diGenova has worked in Washington legal circles for decades. He is a former Republican-appointed United States attorney for the District of Columbia. And he has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George H.W. Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton.In 1995, Mr. diGenova declared the investigation he led was “unnecessary.” And, he said, “a Kafkaesque journey for a group of innocent Americans comes to an end.”Mr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role of the independent counsel — as defined in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal — ought to be narrowed.Drawing on his own experience, Mr. diGenova said in 1998 that the law, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, should not be renewed. He argued that once the independent counsel law was invoked, the prosecutors were forced into bringing “an unnatural degree of targeted attention” to the case. In 1999, the United States Congress let the independent counsel portions of the law expire.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/andrew-mccabe-fbi-firing-explained.html","WASHINGTON — Andrew G. McCabe, the former F.B.I. deputy director, was fired late Friday night — on the eve of his retirement. Here’s what we know.Who Is Andrew McCabe?Mr. McCabe is a 21-year F.B.I. veteran who joined the bureau out of law school and rose to its No. 2 position in 2016. The deputy director is essentially the F.B.I.’s chief operating officer.Why Does He Matter?He oversaw two of the most politically charged cases in F.B.I. history: the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, and the investigation of Donald J. Trump’s campaign ties to the Russian government.Why Was He Fired?Mr. McCabe was questioned as part of a wide-ranging internal inquiry into the F.B.I.’s handling of the Clinton investigation and other matters. During the internal investigation, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, Mr. McCabe “lacked candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions.” That is a fireable offense, and Mr. Sessions said that career, apolitical employees at the F.B.I. and Justice Department agreed that Mr. McCabe should be fired.At issue is whether Mr. McCabe was forthcoming with investigators about what Mr. Sessions said was an “unauthorized disclosure to the news media.”Was He Leaking Information to Damage Mr. Trump?Not as far as anyone can tell. The story at the heart of the case was published  in The Wall Street Journal in October 2016, just days before the election as the F.B.I. raced to review newly discovered emails from Mrs. Clinton’s server. The Journal revealed a dispute between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department over how to handle a separate Clinton investigation, one into her family’s foundation.Mr. McCabe authorized an F.B.I. spokesman and lawyer to speak to The Journal to rebut suggestions that he had put the brakes on the investigation. These types of interactions between journalists and government officials — known as “background calls” — are common in all federal agencies and administrations as officials try to correct inaccuracies or provide details and nuance before reporters publish information.The Journal ultimately reported that while Justice Department officials did not authorize subpoenas, the F.B.I. in fact had pressed ahead with the case — a detail that if anything was damaging to Mrs. Clinton, not Mr. Trump.Did the White House Fire Mr. McCabe?No. As a career civil servant, Mr. McCabe is not a political appointee who can be summarily dismissed by the president. But this is where the situation gets complicated. Mr. Trump has repeatedly used his Twitter account to attack Mr. McCabe. Months before the firing, he taunted Mr. McCabe about his pension.And he goaded Mr. Sessions into taking action against Mr. McCabe.On the eve of Mr. McCabe’s firing, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, called him a “bad actor.” Taken together, this unusual level of White House commentary created a political backdrop to what should have been an independent government personnel decision. Mr. McCabe’s lawyers seized on that as evidence of improper influence.“This distortion of the process begins at the very top, with the president’s repeated offensive, drive-by Twitter attacks on Mr. McCabe.” — Michael R. Bromwich, a lawyer for Mr. McCabeWhy Was He Fired So Quickly?That is one of the big unknowns. F.B.I. disciplinary matters can drag out for extended periods, and it is not uncommon for officials to retire during that process. That did not happen here, and it is not clear why. The workings of the F.B.I.’s disciplinary office are kept confidential.Mr. McCabe’s lawyers say they were given little time to read and respond to the final report and were still receiving new evidence two days before his firing. Why the rush, they ask, if not to make sure that Mr. McCabe was fired?“This concerted effort to accelerate the process, in order to beat the ticking clock of his scheduled retirement, violates any sense of decency and basic principles of fairness,” Mr. Bromwich said.What’s the President’s Beef With Mr. McCabe?Mr. Trump has seized on the fact that Mr. McCabe’s wife, Jill, ran for a Virginia State Senate seat as a Democrat and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from a political ally of Mrs. Clinton. He says Mr. McCabe never should have been allowed to oversee the Clinton investigation. He says the campaign donations are proof that a pro-Clinton bias within the F.B.I. explains why Mrs. Clinton was never charged.Mr. Trump brought up Mr. McCabe’s wife on several occasions, including a face-to-face meeting in which the president called her a “loser.”Does Mr. Trump’s Criticism Have Merit?Yes and no. Mr. McCabe did not begin supervising the Clinton investigation until after his wife had lost the race, and records show that he sought ethics and legal advice inside the F.B.I. before deciding not to recuse himself. But some in the F.B.I. believe he should never have been involved because of his wife’s campaign donations.When he ultimately recused himself, late in the investigation, it only fueled the argument that he should have stepped aside from the beginning.Mr. Trump’s theory of Mr. McCabe as a pro-Clinton partisan, however, is on far shakier ground. Mr. McCabe has identified himself as a lifelong Republican and did not vote in the 2016 election. The newspaper story that Mr. McCabe authorized F.B.I. officials speak about was not a positive one for Mrs. Clinton.And, perhaps most importantly, in the months before the election, when the F.B.I. publicly disclosed information about its work on the Clinton investigation, it never revealed the existence and scope of a full-throated investigation into the Trump campaign’s Russia ties.What Does This Possibly Have to Do with Russia?Like so much at the F.B.I., Mr. McCabe’s firing has become inextricably entangled in presidential politics and the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. McCabe was one of only a handful of F.B.I. officials involved in the Russia investigation from the first days. He supervised it at every step and was involved in the decision to seek a wiretap on Carter Page, a former Trump foreign adviser. That wiretap application was approved by senior Justice Department officials, was reapproved by Mr. Trump’s own Justice Department and was signed by a federal judge based on evidence that Mr. Page was a Russian agent. Mr. Trump has declared that wiretap to be improper, however, and points to it as evidence of political surveillance by the F.B.I.Mr. McCabe also worked alongside the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who accused Mr. Trump of seeking a loyalty oath and pressing him to end the investigation. Those conversations are now part of an obstruction investigation. Mr. McCabe kept memos on his conversations with Mr. Comey, which could help investigators corroborate Mr. Comey’s account.Mr. McCabe argues that the Trump administration is trying to discredit him as a potential witness. The real target, Mr. McCabe said, is Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Mr. Trump’s team seemingly gave credence to that argument last weekend when the Daily Beast asked for Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer for a comment on Mr. McCabe’s firing and he responded with a call to end the Mueller investigation.From a political standpoint, if Mr. Trump discredits Mr. McCabe, he can raise questions about everything Mr. McCabe has touched — including the Russia investigation. Mr. McCabe’s allies have come to his defense.Well, He Did Lie, Right?What we know right now is that Mr. Sessions found repeated examples in which Mr. McCabe “lacked candor.” And career officials — not Trump appointees — recommended dismissal. Mr. Sessions accepted that recommendation.“The F.B.I. expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability,” Mr. Sessions said.Mr. McCabe denies being untruthful. He says he answered every question honestly and, when he was misunderstood, he reached out to the investigators to correct the record.What’s Next?We won’t be able to assess the allegations, or Mr. McCabe’s defense, until the inspector general’s report is released. That is expected sometime this spring. Mr. McCabe has seen it but cannot discuss it until it is public. When it is released, his lawyers say, he has a point-by-point rebuttal to offer.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/supreme-court-death-penalty.html","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday turned down a request that it take a fresh look at whether the death penalty is constitutional anywhere in the nation.The court also refused to consider a narrower question in the same case: Whether Arizona’s capital sentencing system, which appears to make virtually all murderers eligible for the death penalty, violates the Constitution.In a 2015 dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer had urged his colleagues to revisit the death penalty, saying that “it is highly likely” that it violates the Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishments. He said that there was evidence that innocent people have been executed, that death row exonerations were frequent, that death sentences were imposed arbitrarily and that the capital justice system was warped by racial discrimination and politics.Only Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the 2015 dissent, and the issue does not seem to have gained traction in the intervening years.Justice Breyer on Monday also issued a statement on the narrower challenge, saying that Arizona’s capital sentencing system may well be unconstitutional and inviting a further challenge with more evidence. Justices Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Justice Breyer’s statement.The case concerned Abel Daniel Hidalgo, who agreed to kill Michael Cordova, whom he did not know, for $1,000 payment from a gang member. He committed the murder at an auto body shop in 2001, and he also killed Jose Rojas, a bystander who happened to be present.When the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 after a four-year moratorium, it upheld capital sentencing systems which sought to reserve the penalty for the worst offenders by insisting that juries find “aggravating factors” before a death sentence may be imposed.Arizona’s system includes so many possible factors, its critics say, that it does almost nothing to cull the worst offenders from others. Around 98 percent of convicted murderers, they say, are eligible for the death penalty there.Mr. Hidalgo pleaded guilty and was sentenced to death after a jury found that he had killed in exchange for money, committed multiple homicides and had committed another serious crime.Justice Breyer wrote that the record in the case, Hidalgo v. Arizona, No. 17-251, as too thin to adequately evaluate the argument that the state’s approach was unconstitutional.Using public records requests, Mr. Hidalgo’s lawyers had obtained information about 860 first-degree murder cases in one Arizona county. They showed that essentially every defendant was eligible for the death penalty under the state’s sentencing laws.“That evidence is unrebutted,” Justice Breyer wrote. “It points to a possible constitutional problem. And it was assumed to be true by the state courts below. Evidence of this kind warrants careful attention and evaluation.”But the state courts had rejected Mr. Hidalgo’s request for a hearing to develop and test the evidence, Justice Breyer wrote. The Supreme Court would be in a better position to consider the constitutionality of Arizona’s sentencing system, he wrote, after a more rigorous empirical inquiry.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/baseball-tax-law-.html","WASHINGTON — As President Trump congratulated the Houston Astros for winning the World Series at a White House ceremony last week, he also heaped praise on himself and congressional Republicans for passing a sweeping tax cut last year. He hailed Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the House’s chief tax writer and an Astros superfan, as “the king of those tax cuts.”What he did not mention is that the new tax law Mr. Brady helped draft, and which Mr. Trump signed, levies a large new tax on the Astros, and similar franchises across professional sports.The law changed a corner of the tax code that mostly applies to farmers, manufacturers and other businesses that until recently could swap certain assets like trucks and machinery tax-free. But by adding a single word to the newly written tax code — “real” — the law now only allows real estate swaps to qualify for that special treatment.That change is meant to capture more federal revenue, in order to partially offset reductions in business and personal income tax rates. It forces manufacturers, farmers and others to pay more in capital gains taxes, if they trade an asset for something more valuable. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the change will raise $31 billion over the next decade.It also means that the Astros and other sports franchises could now face capital gains taxes every time they exchange or trade their highly paid players.The provision is raising concerns and questions across Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, starting with: How do you value a player?“There is no fair-market value of a baseball player. There isn’t,” said Daniel R. Halem, the chief legal officer of Major League Baseball. “I don’t really know what our clubs are going to do to address the issue. We haven’t fully figured it out yet. This is a change we hope was inadvertent, and we’re going to lobby hard to get it corrected.”The N.B.A. is similarly perplexed. It sent teams an email earlier this month detailing the disruption of the trading system under the new law, but told executives it was still figuring out how to respond.The confusion is only one of many side effects of the new tax law, which sped through the House and Senate in less than two months at the end of last year, resulting in a series of changes that were both intentional and inadvertent. Republicans say they weren’t trying to hamstring sports teams: The change in the like-kind provision, Senate staff members said, was simply an attempt to broaden the United States tax base.But that is little consolation to the teams who now join restaurateurs, independent agriculture businesses and multinational corporations on a long list of entities affected by the law in ways they did not see coming, and who now face long odds to secure changes or clarifications.Major League Baseball and N.B.A. officials expressed hope that Congress would revisit the provision, which is one of many parts of the law that could raise their taxes or hurt their revenues.It is unclear how aggressively the Internal Revenue Service would enforce the provision with sports teams. Mr. Halem, of Major League Baseball, said the league was asking the Treasury Department for guidance on how to come up with valuations for tax purposes. If such a system was the intended result of the law, he said, “then write some regulations, tell us what you mean.”I.R.S. officials declined to comment on whether the agency would issue future rulings on the tax treatment of sports trades. Treasury officials did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.Like many franchises, the Astros have aggressively worked the baseball trade market to improve their roster. Last year, on their way to their first World Series championship, they engineered a last-minute deal ahead of the league’s trade deadline to acquire Justin Verlander, a veteran starting pitcher midway through a 6-year, $162 million contract, from the Detroit Tigers in exchange for three up-and-coming young players. Last month, the Astros acquired the veteran pitcher Gerrit Cole from the Pittsburgh Pirates in a similar trade.For decades, teams have not paid taxes on such trades, and thus have not had to account for the value of the assets they are exchanging, for tax purposes. A 1967 ruling from the Internal Revenue Service allowed baseball owners to depreciate the cost of player contracts over several years, thus reducing the team’s taxable income. It declared that “trades of player contracts owned by major league baseball clubs will be considered exchanges of like-kind property” under a section of the tax code.That distinction was crucial. Until this year, the “like-kind” provision allowed owners of similar types of property, such as machinery or fleet vehicles, to swap their assets without paying taxes on either party’s gains until the asset was sold. In a baseball or basketball trade, the assets aren’t players, they are the players’ contracts — and the I.R.S. was allowing them to be exchanged without fear of taxation.The new law breaks that peace, by limiting like-kind exchanges to “real property,” which is shorthand for land or other real estate.“I don’t think that they thought about baseball when they thought about this change,” said Kari Smoker, an accounting professor at SUNY Brockport who has consulted for the N.B.A. and National Hockey League players’ associations in legislative disputes over sports taxation. “It raises all kinds of issues, which I think were easier to ignore, probably, when we had a simple rule that it was a like-kind exchange.”Mr. Verlander, for example, was clearly a more immediately valuable asset to the Astros than the three prospects they traded to get him. He gave up only four runs in his five regular-season starts for the team, then won four straight starts to begin the playoffs. In very simple terms, he brought value to the Astros in a trade, and had the new law been in place last year, the team would have owed taxes on that added value.But what, exactly, was that value? Was it the size of his contract? Mr. Verlander earned $28 million last year, while the players traded for him drew minor-league salaries. Was it the additional wins he brought to the team? Statisticians estimate Mr. Verlander gave the Astros nearly two more wins last season, a value that, depending on the statistician, could reach $20 million. Or was some calculation of the total future value Mr. Verlander will bring to the team, minus the total future value it gave up in the prospects it traded away — and possibly adjusted for the amount the team will have to pay Mr. Verlander?Complicating matters further is that teams value players differently, and one player might help a certain team far more than another team. A struggling club with a surplus of starting pitchers might trade one to a playoff contender in desperate need of one, in exchange for position players who could improve a struggling lineup. In that case, both teams could, reasonably, be considered to have gained value in the trade, and thus would owe taxes on it.That is exactly how Adam Guttridge views the trade of Mr. Verlander — as a win-win for both the Astros and Tigers, which would have resulted in a capital-gains tax bill for each of them. Mr. Guttridge is a former manager of baseball research and development for the Milwaukee Brewers and the co-founder of NEIFI, a consultancy that has developed software to attach a dollar value to every professional ballplayer and his expected future performance.How to calculate such value for tax purposes “is the question that somebody has to answer, that nobody in the baseball space has,” Mr. Guttridge said. “There’s certainly no consensus among the 30 teams.”Several baseball executives declined to comment on the change and how it could affect their willingness to trade players in the future, including the general manager of the Astros, Jeff Luhnow.Basketball could be an even trickier proposition, because it taxes teams if they exceed a certain amount of total player salary for the season. This year, the Portland Trail Blazers traded a player with a modest contract in order to get under the tax threshold, saving themselves millions. The Cleveland Cavaliers made a series of trades that pushed them over the threshold. Some N.B.A. executives — who would not speak for publication — wondered if the Trail Blazers would need to pay federal tax on the money they avoided in league taxes as a result of a trade.The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, did not return a request for comment on whether he would be inclined to support a bill to change the law for sports teams. Neither did Mr. Brady, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, who reveled in the Astros championship run last year.“At my desk,” he posted on Twitter, alongside a picture of himself, on Nov. 1, the day of Game 7 of the World Series, “wearing my #Astros tie, putting final touches on the first bold #TaxReform in 31 years.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/europe-digital-tax-trade.html","WASHINGTON — A global attempt to prevent large, multinational companies from shifting their profits to lower-tax jurisdictions is setting off a fight between the United States and Europe, as policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic spar over efforts to impose new taxes on foreign firms.On Wednesday, the European Commission is expected to take aim at Silicon Valley’s tech giants with a proposal to seriously revamp how technology companies are taxed in the 28-nation European Union. The plan, outlined in a draft obtained by The New York Times, would tax digital media companies based on where they generate revenue, rather than where they have their regional headquarters, which are often in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg that have lower tax rates.The proposal comes in the wake of the new $1.5 trillion tax law that President Trump signed last year, which tried to crack down on profit-shifting by imposing a new minimum tax on the overseas earnings of any companies with United States operations. The international provisions in the United States tax law have angered some European leaders, who say they go too far and may violate World Trade Organization rules.The global tensions — and the dueling tax efforts — stem from a shared concern among foreign governments that large, multinational corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes to the countries where they do business. American tech giants like Amazon, Apple and Google have kept their tax bills low for years by keeping profits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions.But there is no agreement about how to remedy such tax avoidance. The efforts are exacerbating the already heightened strain between the United States and Europe over a White House plan to impose stiff tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports.“Tax and trade have basically merged” as issues between the United States and Europe, said Jay Khosla, the staff director for the Senate Finance Committee.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has been trying to coordinate global efforts to combat tax evasion. In a report  on digital taxation issued on Friday, which was separate from the European Union proposal, the organization said that more than 110 countries agreed to review the international tax system, parts of which had been rendered obsolete by the digital economy.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, criticized the report, saying in a statement that the United States “firmly opposes proposals by any country to single out digital companies.”He added that the digital tax under discussion in Europe would harm American workers and consumers and inhibit economic growth by unfairly targeting a sector that has been a source of great innovation.Pascal Saint-Amans, the director of the O.E.C.D.’s Center for Tax Policy and Administration, said that the level of animosity could undermine what had been a coordinated, global effort to crack down on tax avoidance.“There are very positive aspects which should be conducive to conversation, but the background is tension, with risks,” Mr. Saint-Amans said, adding that his organization was trying to ensure that “these countries don’t go to war, at a time when there are some worries on that front.”The European Union’s new tax proposal is expected to hit Silicon Valley tech companies the hardest by forcing them to pay taxes to governments where they do business.For example, Amazon operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country but one with legal loopholes, sweetheart tax deals and low effective corporate taxes. The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the 23.3 percent that traditional businesses pay.Amazon has been the focus of European officials in the past. Last year, Luxembourg was ordered by the European Union’s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon.Amazon is not alone. European regulators have pressed technology companies on a range of issues, mounting an aggressive campaign against tax avoidance, the mishandling of private data and anti-competitive behavior. But that push has prompted complaints from American tech giants, which argue that they are being unfairly singled out by Brussels. European officials strongly deny those claims, arguing that Europe welcomes American technology, but not tax evasion.Within the past few years, the European Commission has ordered Apple to pay €13 billion in back taxes and levied fines against other tech giants for abusing their dominant market positions. In January, European antitrust officials fined Qualcomm, the chip maker, €997 million for illegally shutting rivals out of the market for certain smartphone and tablet chipsets for more than five years. Qualcomm said it would appeal the ruling.Last year, the European Commission fined Google €2.42 billion for using its search engine to favor its own comparison shopping service — called Google Shopping — in search results while demoting results of rival services. Google has appealed the ruling.Now, as the European Union prepares to institute comprehensive new data protection rules in May, European regulators have opened a novel line of attack. They are investigating the tech giants’ vast information-gathering operations as potential anti-competitive abuses.In December, Germany’s federal cartel office said Facebook had abused its dominant position by requiring its users to let the social network “limitlessly amass” data by tracking them through other online services — including the Facebook-owned platforms Instagram and WhatsApp. Antitrust regulators said they were “not convinced that users have given their effective consent” to Facebook’s data practices and that the extent of the data collection violated mandatory European data protection principles.In a blog post, Facebook said that it was cooperating with the German agency, but challenged the claim that it had a dominant position, saying that the social network was merely “popular in Germany.” The company also said it would “be working directly with relevant data protection officials” to ensure compliance with the upcoming European data regulation.The European Commission’s new proposed tax is likely to apply to companies with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros, or about $925 million, and cover sales generated within the bloc that top €50 million a year. It would affect revenue coming from specific digital services, such as digital advertising, paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data. The relatively high threshold is intended to ensure that the tax affects only large companies with a significant presence in the European Union.The exact thresholds and rates have not yet been established, and the plan is not guaranteed to be put into effect, either. The proposals must still be approved by the parliament and the bloc’s member states, and although countries such as France and Germany have raised concerns over companies they say have not paid their fair share of taxes, other member states like Ireland have opposed changes to a system in which they can use tax policy to attract businesses.“The taxation will go to the biggest markets with the most sales, and that effectively means that activities which could be taxed in Estonia will be transferred to Germany,” said Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels who focuses on the trans-Atlantic economy, trade and digital policy. “Some member states may question whether that redistribution is a good thing.”As the schism widens between the continents on how to ensure fairness on issues like market competition and data privacy rights in the digital era, it is not clear what steps Washington might take in response to a new European digital tax, but there could be calls for the Trump administration to retaliate.In 2015, when the European Union tried to go after American technology companies for tax avoidance, some lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to use the president’s authority to retaliate on the grounds that Europe was imposing discriminatory taxes on American businesses.But European leaders are not just rankled by American tech companies, they are rankled by United States tax policy as well. They have criticized provisions of the new law that tax multinational corporations with operations in the United States, particularly a provision that taxes the American subsidiaries of foreign banks for loans they receive from their parent companies, saying that goes too far and violates World Trade Organization rules.There is some concern among Republican lawmakers that Washington’s push to impose tariffs could allow Europeans to argue to the trade body that the United States is engaged in a pattern of protectionist actions, not just on trade, but on taxes. The dispute could heat up on the sidelines of the G-20 conference in Argentina this week, where Mr. Mnuchin is meeting with other finance ministers.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/supreme-court-plo-trump-terrorism-case.html","WASHINGTON — Last June, the Supreme Court asked the Trump administration to file a brief. The justices wanted advice on whether to hear an appeal from victims of terrorist attacks in Israel.The request seemed unwelcome, and months passed without a response.In late October, two dozen senators — including Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, and Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts — wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. Get moving, the senators said.“We urge the administration to demonstrate its resolve to combat international terrorism and put American victims first by avoiding any unnecessary delay and responding as soon as possible to the Supreme Court’s request,” the letter said.Two more months passed. In December, President Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and said he would move the United States Embassy there. But still no brief.The plaintiffs in the case are American families who were the victims of terrorist attacks in and near Jerusalem. They won a $655.5 million court judgment in federal court in Manhattan against the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority. But an appeals court threw out the judgment, saying that Congress had overstepped its authority in enacting a law that allowed the families to sue.At the Supreme Court, another two months elapsed without a brief, and with them the possibility of having the case decided in the term that will end this June. Finally, after an extended internal debate that included officials from the Justice Department and a short-handed State Department, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco filed the requested document last month.In the end, the administration sided with the P.L.O.Mr. Francisco’s brief was a model of lawyerly minimalism. It urged the justices to turn down the victims’ appeal, saying it did not “warrant this court’s intervention at this time.” But the brief took no position on whether the plaintiffs’ legal arguments were correct.This did not sit well with Theodore B. Olson, a lawyer for the victims who served as solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration. In a brief filed last week, Mr. Olson called the administration’s position “astonishing” and “disturbingly disingenuous.”In an interview, Mr. Olson said his team had urged the solicitor general’s office to move fast enough to allow a decision this term. “We got no explanation” for the delay, he said. “It seemed unconscionably long.”“We’ve got 11 families who are victims of terrorism and who have suffered a lot,” Mr. Olson said. “This is so painful and difficult for them.”The families had sued the two Palestinian groups under the Antiterrorism Act of 1992, which was designed to allow such suits by giving federal courts jurisdiction over acts of international terrorism against Americans. After a seven-week jury trial in 2015 in Manhattan, the plaintiffs won $218.5 million, which was automatically tripled under the 1992 law.The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, threw out the award, saying the trial court had lacked jurisdiction over the Palestinian groups because they did not have a substantial presence in the United States and had not set out specifically to kill and injure Americans.“Federal courts cannot exercise jurisdiction in a civil case beyond the limits prescribed by the due process clause of the Constitution, no matter how horrendous the underlying attacks or morally compelling the plaintiffs’ claims,” Judge John G. Koeltl, who ordinarily sits on the Federal District Court in Manhattan, wrote for the unanimous three-judge panel.Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for the solicitor general’s office, said the administration was committed to fighting terrorism.“The United States condemns acts of terror in the strongest terms, and the Department of Justice is committed to prosecuting those who commit terrorist attacks against innocent human beings to the fullest extent that the law allows,” she said in a statement. “The United States sympathizes deeply with the American families who, in 2004, sued the Palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization for acts of terrorism committed against their loved ones between 2002 and 2004.”“The court of appeals decided, however,” she said, “that the suit was not consistent with due process under the Constitution, and its decision does not meet the usual standards for Supreme Court review. We will continue to support wherever possible all lawful actions to fight terrorism and provide redress to the victims of terrorist attacks and their families.”When the Supreme Court asks the solicitor general for his or her views on whether to hear an appeal, as it does about 25 times each term, it presumably wants to know both whether the case warrants the justices’ attention and whether the party seeking review is right.Mr. Francisco gave only half an answer, taking no position on whether the appeals court’s decision was correct. According to Mr. Olson’s brief, “research revealed only one other instance since 2014 in which the solicitor general did not state a view on the merits” in similar circumstances.The two sides disagree about how many cases will be thwarted by the appeals court’s ruling. “It is far from clear that the court of appeals’ approach will foreclose many claims that would otherwise go forward in federal courts,” Mr. Francisco wrote for the administration.The entire House of Representatives and 23 senators disagreed. In briefs filed last April, they said the appeals court’s ruling had cut the heart out of the statute, effectively nullifying it.When a federal court strikes down parts of a federal law, the solicitor general typically defends the statute. In his brief, Mr. Olson, a former solicitor general, used unusually harsh words in criticizing the current one for taking a different approach.“The United States’ argument that this court should not address this issue is, to put it bluntly,” he wrote, “a blatant abdication of duty.”Those are harsh words, and they will get the justices’ attention when they meet in private next week to discuss whether to hear the case, Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation Organization, No. 16-1071, almost 13 months after the plaintiffs filed their petition seeking review.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/native-american-woman-congress.html","ALBUQUERQUE — When Deb Haaland was a child, she would rise early on this state’s sun-beaten tribal land, sling a water jar around her waist and climb the mesa overlooking her pueblo.It was as high as she ever thought she would go.Now, she is among a historic number of Native American women running for elective office. None has ever served in Congress, but that could change this year if Ms. Haaland wins.In all, there are at least four indigenous women running for Congress, three more are bidding for governors’ offices and another 31 are campaigning for seats in state legislatures — from both sides of the aisle.The numbers far outstrip past election cycles, longtime observers of native politics say, and they are only partly driven by the liberal energy and #MeToo declarations that have flourished since President Trump’s election.More broadly, they are part of a decades-long shift in which native communities, long marginalized by United States voting laws and skeptical of a government that stripped them of land and traditions, are moving into mainstream politics.Montana has more than a dozen Native Americans running for the state House this year. Utah tribes are pushing the governor to make a seat for them in his cabinet. Five native people serve in the Minnesota Legislature, and four of them are women.“American Indians have been invisible for so long, in so many sectors in society,” said Denise Juneau, who was among the first native women in the country to be elected to a statewide executive position when she became the Montana schools superintendent in 2009. In that role, she developed an Indian history curriculum that is being replicated across the American West. “To be able to make inroads in the political world,” she said, “is huge.”Many of these candidates are running on a liberal platform fueled by opposition to the Trump administration, as Ms. Haaland is. But others are Republicans who don’t fit that mold at all.One is Andria Tupola, a Native Hawaiian lawmaker running for governor of Hawaii on a promise of tax cuts and small government. Another is Sharon Clahchischilliage, who was a co-chairwoman of Mr. Trump’s Native American coalition in 2016 and is running for re-election to the New Mexico House on a platform she calls “fighting the environmentalists.”Ms. Clahchischilliage is a fierce advocate for a coal-fired power plant that employs many Navajo people. She is hoping Mr. Trump will halt the threatened closing of the plant. Keeping it open, she said, could save 1,600 jobs.“What I love about Trump is that he understands,” she said. “He gets it. He is asking: What regulations need to change?”Here in Albuquerque, Ms. Haaland, a Democrat, recently won 35 percent of the vote in a six-candidate field at the state party convention. She is a “strong contender” to win the June primary, said Joe Monahan, a longtime New Mexico political blogger. (Her district covers most of Albuquerque and has elected Democrats for a decade).“We’re seeing a new generation of Native Americans who have seen more opportunity in education starting to knock down the doors in politics,” Mr. Monahan said. “And it’s not a loud movement, but it’s a steady movement.”Ms. Haaland is a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo, a sovereign nation west of Albuquerque that is one the country’s 573 federally recognized tribes. A child of military veterans, she attended 13 public schools before graduating from high school, then started a salsa company and worked as a cake decorator before putting herself through college and law school on a mix of food stamps and student loans.She entered politics in 2008 as a volunteer for Barack Obama, then spent years crisscrossing the state to register native voters in some of the country’s most remote corners. In 2015, she became the head of the state Democratic Party and helped to flip the New Mexico House of Representatives back to Democratic control.On the campaign trail, she frequently cites her heritage, and she makes the argument that many of the issues affecting native communities — the ubiquity of low-wage jobs, violence against women — afflict other groups as well.“I know what it’s like to get my health care from the Indian Health Service, and hold a sick child in the waiting room for three hours until you have a chance to see a doctor,” she said in an interview at her headquarters, a sparsely furnished office downtown splashed with political signs saying “Healthcare Not Warfare” and “¡Obámanos Nuevo México!”Her priority in Congress, she said, would be to turn New Mexico into a solar energy powerhouse, a message with appeal in an impoverished state that has struggled to diversify an economy dependent on oil and gas.She faces a field crowded with qualified candidates, including Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, a former law school dean who has spent a career building social justice programs.The main criticism of Ms. Haaland is that she is concealing a lack of policy depth by focusing on the historic nature of her candidacy. “That as a single theme could leave her vulnerable,” Mr. Monahan said.The United States did not grant native people full citizenship and the right to vote in federal elections until 1924, and for years they were mostly absent from federal government, according to Mark Trahant, a professor at the University of North Dakota who writes extensively about Native Americans in politics.That began to change in the late 1950s, when Washington instituted a policy known as termination, abolishing tribal governments and taking Indian land.Facing existential threats, native leaders began to exhort fellow Indians to vote and run for office. Men began to make elective inroads, and in recent years women have followed. In 2001, the coalition of tribes known as the National Congress of American Indians began a voting project that continues today.To be sure, Native Americans are just 2 percent of the population, and low voter turnout persists in many communities.But that is changing in some corners, and American Indians have the potential to sway elections in states like Montana, where they make up 7 percent of the voting-age population; New Mexico, where they are more than 10 percent; and Alaska, where they are more than 17 percent.Today there are two native men in the United States House of Representatives, both Republicans from Oklahoma. (Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, has discussed having native heritage but is not enrolled in a tribe.)Among the native women seeking office this year is Peggy Flanagan, a former director of a nonprofit organization who is running for lieutenant governor of Minnesota.In an interview, Ms. Flanagan said that if she wins, she will oppose a proposed pipeline across historic Ojibwe land; send money meant to help native people to tribes rather than county governments; and bring attention to the country’s many missing and murdered native women.But Ms. Juneau, the Montana school superintendent, warned that the hardest part of winning an election as an Indian woman is proving that you can represent the entire state, not just its tribes.“It’s not like, as a person of color or as an American Indian woman, you can walk into a room and say: ‘I’m qualified,’ and everybody looks at you like that,” she said. “You have to prove it. And we will — eventually.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/economy/mcdonalds-labor.html","The Trump appointee charged with enforcing federal labor rights is scrambling to head off a court ruling in a case against McDonald’s that could redefine the accountability of companies for the labor practices of their franchisees.The official, the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, has been exploring settlement terms with workers at the center of the board’s complaint against McDonald’s, according to lawyers involved in the case. A judge had halted the trial until Monday to give the agency a chance to do so.If no settlement is reached and the judge were to rule against the company, the decision could have enormous implications for the franchise business model, affecting millions of workers in the fast-food industry and beyond. Corporations could be required to bargain with unionized workers at disparate franchise locations.The National Labor Relations Board did not respond to a request for comment. A McDonald’s spokeswoman said that “settlement discussions are a normal part of any litigation process.”The case was brought during the Obama administration, when the board was under Democratic control. Since President Trump’s election, Republican members have regained a majority, steering the board away from a pro-labor orientation.A central question in the trial is whether McDonald’s is a so-called joint employer of workers directly employed by its franchisees. A parent company is considered a joint employer if it controls their working conditions, although the legal criteria for determining control in this context has shifted in recent years.A finding that McDonald’s is a joint employer would make the company liable for labor-law violations committed by its franchisees, and would require it to bargain with restaurant workers who unionize.The workers in the case asserted that their bosses at McDonald’s restaurants disciplined them, retaliated against them and in some cases fired them for taking part in protests beginning in 2012 in which they demanded a $15 hourly wage and a union. Roughly two dozen could be owed a monetary settlement, according to a lawyer involved.The general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, at the time an appointee of President Barack Obama, investigated their charges and issued complaints against McDonald’s and its franchisees in 2014. A trial began in 2015 and continued through this year.But in January, the labor board’s new general counsel, appointed by President Trump, was granted a 60-day stay in the case — expiring Monday — to pursue settlement talks.The general counsel, Peter B. Robb, argued that two labor board decisions in December, one of which changed the legal standard for determining joint employment, might have weakened aspects of the case against McDonald’s and made a settlement more likely.In his request for a stay, Mr. Robb said a settlement could “facilitate far more prompt and immediate remedial relief for the employees impacted by the alleged unfair labor practices.”Before the December decision by the board, a parent company like McDonald’s could be considered a joint employer under federal labor law if it exerted indirect control over workers at a franchisee, or if it had the right to exercise control over workers that it nonetheless did not exercise.After the board’s decision in December, an employer had to have direct and immediate control over workers to be considered a joint employer.At the time he sought a stay, labor groups argued that Mr. Robb’s logic was specious because the board’s case against McDonald’s did not hinge on which definition of joint employment applied.Lawyers for the Service Employees International Union and affiliated groups, which helped make the case against McDonald’s and have advocated for the workers, argued that even if the general counsel preferred to seek a settlement, it made no sense to stop the trial, which was only days from concluding, in order to do so.In a court filing, they argued that stopping the trial would give McDonald’s an advantage by preventing union lawyers from cross-examining a key witness, and that it fostered “a game of hide-the-ball.”Then, last month, one of Mr. Robb’s primary arguments for a pause in the trial abruptly deserted him when the labor board, on a procedural question, reversed its December decision narrowing the definition of a joint employer. At that point, the joint employer definition reverted to what it had been earlier in the trial.Several Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, stated in a March 7 letter to Mr. Robb that the board’s reversal “eliminates whatever support may have existed for your efforts to settle the McDonald’s case so near to the trial’s close,” and urged Mr. Robb to “swiftly resume and finish the trial.”But Mr. Robb’s office pressed ahead with its efforts to reach a settlement before the stay expired. Last week, lawyers from the labor board’s regional offices abruptly reached out to several former McDonald’s workers involved in the case. In one instance, according to an email to a labor board lawyer from Micah Wissinger, a lawyer advocating the workers’ cause on behalf of the union, a labor board lawyer called a worker and asked if she “was ok with $50k” for back pay as part of the settlement. The offer was conditional on her waiving her right to be reinstated in her old job.Mr. Wissinger said that the calls created the impression that workers needed to accept the offers before they consulted with him or his colleagues or anyone else, and that at least two did.“It was a done deal by the time we found out,” Mr. Wissinger said. “They were completely cutting us out of the process.”Bloomberg reported on the aggressive settlement efforts over the weekend.Jennifer Abruzzo, who served as deputy general counsel of the labor board until 2017, said settlement discussions that exclude lawyers who back the workers were a break with custom.“That’s unusual,” Ms. Abruzzo said. “The charging party is the one that the regions typically go to. And the charging party in this instance is the S.E.I.U.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/trump-saudi-yemen.html","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is furiously trying to fend off a bipartisan effort in Congress to halt American military support to the deadly Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen as the kingdom’s influential young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, arrives in Washington this week for talks with President Trump.Even as the State Department weighs approval of more than $1 billion in new arms to the Saudis, lawmakers are pushing for a resolution that they say would prevent Washington from giving the Saudis “a blank check” in the conflict. According to the United Nations, 10,000 civilians have been killed and 40,000 wounded in the fighting, exacerbating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.Top Pentagon and State Department officials rushed to Capitol Hill last week to warn senators in a closed, classified briefing that approving the Senate measure could seriously damage relations with Saudi Arabia. The crown prince is scheduled to meet with the president and other officials on Tuesday, and a vote on the measure could come later this week.Since 2015, the United States has provided the Saudi-led air campaign in Yemen with air-to-air refueling, intelligence assessments and other military advice. “New restrictions on this limited U.S. military support could increase civilian casualties, jeopardize cooperation with our partners on counterterrorism and reduce our influence with the Saudis,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in a letter last week to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.The Pentagon insists that all of its military aid is noncombat assistance, like advising the Saudi Air Force on adopting bombing practices that kill fewer civilians. But at the same time, the defense contractor Raytheon is courting lawmakers and the State Department to allow it to sell 60,000 precision-guided munitions to both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, another member of the air campaign, in deals worth billions of dollars.“The U.S. government claims that it’s not engaged in hostilities unless U.S. troops are on the ground being shot at by the enemy,” Senator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican and co-sponsor of the resolution, said on the Senate floor last week. “It stretches the imagination, and it stretches the English language beyond its breaking point, to suggest the U.S. military is not engaged in hostilities in Yemen.”Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the resolution would allow American-backed counterterrorism operations against Al Qaeda in other parts of Yemen to continue, but would “ensure that the United States is not giving the Saudis a blank check to bomb Yemen and worsen the humanitarian crisis.”In a sometimes testy Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last week, some senators accused the Pentagon of being complicit in the errant bombing campaign.“We are enabling the Saudis to continue their battle there,” said Senator Mazie K. Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii.“We’re not parties to this conflict,” replied Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of the Pentagon’s Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East.“We’re helping them,,” Ms. Hirono shot back. “We’re enabling the Saudis.”American advisers do not give direct or indirect approval on target selection or execution of bombings, Pentagon officials say. Rather, they give advice on targeting procedures and facilitate checks of a list of “no-strike” buildings, like mosques and marketplaces. More recently, they have helped the Saudis to improve the effectiveness of their Patriot antimissile systems, officials said.“We can help them. We can advise them. We can share our lessons learned on how to more effectively apply their capabilities,” General Votel said.But the general acknowledged that the military does not track where an American-refueled Saudi jet is going, what targets it strikes or the results of that mission.Yemen, one of the poorest nations in the Arab world, has been convulsed by civil strife since the Houthis, Shiite rebels from the north aligned with Iran, stormed the capital, Sana, in 2014 and ousted the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the Americans’ main counterterrorism partner.In March 2015, Saudi Arabia and a coalition of Arab nations began a military campaign aimed at pushing back the Houthis and restoring the government. That campaign has so far failed to do so, and has instead caused the world’s most severe humanitarian crisis, with the worst outbreak of cholera in contemporary history and widespread child malnutrition.Last year, Saudi Arabia said it was engaging in a $750 million, multiyear training program through the American military, and taking several other measures, to help prevent the accidental killing of civilians in the air campaign against Houthi rebels. It was a tacit acknowledgment of the weaknesses of the Saudi armed forces.Human rights groups say that Saudi Arabia has failed to meet its promises. “Saudi Arabia had made pledges to make its engagement in Yemen less deadly and destructive,” said Scott Paul, a policy specialist on Yemen at Oxfam America. “We do see the stark evidence that the situation has continued to deteriorate — innocent civilians continue to be caught up and killed in this crisis.”A report to the United Nations Security Council in January described coalition “precautionary measures” as “largely inadequate and ineffective,” and said that “the use of precision-guided weapons is a strong indicator that the intended targets were those affected by the airstrikes.”With Saudi Arabia flying as many as 200 missions a day in Yemen, the kingdom is seeking to buy more of those precision-guided weapons. Thomas A. Kennedy, the chief executive of Raytheon, met with State Department officials this month to promote the proposed sale of munitions to Saudi Arabia and the Emirates.“We value our 50-year partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and look forward to continuing to help meet their security needs,” said Michael F. Doble, a spokesman for Raytheon.The purchase, said William Hartung, the director of the Arms and Security Project at the Center for International Policy, would be “substantial by standards of U.S.-Saudi trade in munitions, certainly one of the largest if not the largest for systems of the kind it likely includes.”In 2017, the United States sold roughly $610 million in weapons and munitions to Saudi Arabia and $48 million in firearms to the Emirates. Bigger equipment, however, such as missile defense systems, made up a large portion of the purchases for both countries over the past year.During his trip to Saudi Arabia last year, his first overseas visit as president, Mr. Trump offered the kingdom a $110 billion arms package. A portion of his pledge — roughly $23.7 billion — had already been authorized under the Obama administration.Human rights groups have long tied American-made weapons to the conflict in Yemen. A May 2017 report from Human Rights Watch said that Raytheon-made munitions had been used in at least four Saudi-led coalition strikes on innocents.In one such attack, 31 civilians were killed and another 42 were wounded, according to the report. Human Rights Watch recovered a portion of one of the bombs used in the strike that had Raytheon production markings and a manufacture date of October 2015.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/school-discipline-disparities-white-black-students.html","MINNEAPOLIS — When Erin Rathke, the principal at Justice Page Middle School, is called to extract a student from class, she hears the same plea over and over again, most often, she has to admit, from black children: “The teacher only sees me.”The plea weighs heavily at Justice Page, where African-American students are 338 percent more likely to be suspended than their white peers. “It’s painful sometimes, but I have to say, ‘Yes, that’s probably true,” Ms. Rathke said.It is a reality that district leaders here have been grappling with for years: The Minneapolis school district suspends an inordinate number of black students compared with white ones, and it is struggling to figure out why. Last year, districtwide, black students were 41 percent of the overall student population, but made up 76 percent of the suspensions.Numbers like that prompted the Obama administration in 2014 to draft tough new policies to try to address racial disparities in school discipline across the country. Now, the Trump administration is trying to reverse those policies — in part, administration officials say, as a response to school shootings like the massacre last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.The Obama-era policies — and the Trump-era reversals — have divided educators in the Twin Cities. In recent months, educators from Minneapolis, St. Paul and suburban Minnesota traveled to Washington to lobby the Education Department in support of reversing the 2014 guidelines, which encouraged school districts to review racial disparities in student discipline rates to ensure against violations of federal civil rights laws. Those that do not comply can face federal investigation or a loss of funding.Then another group followed them to lobby for keeping the guidance.A retired Minnesota teacher set off a conservative media blitz by linking the Obama-era guidance to frustrations that teachers have with violent students, raising the issue high enough for the White House to latch on after the Parkland massacre. The coverage prompted Republicans to speculate about whether relaxed disciplinary policies had allowed the violent track record of Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged in the shooting, to evade law enforcement.Debbie York, the teacher who raised the issue in a Breitbart News article, was forced to retire after a first grader in her suburban Minnesota school pushed her, injuring her back and neck. The school district said she had violated privacy laws by speaking out about the incident.[ALSO READ: How Effective is Your School District?]The story inspired a Minnesota bill bolstering teachers’ authority to remove threatening students from their classrooms. Ms. York is advocating that the law go national, and that the Obama guidance be repealed.“It’s not about arming teachers with guns; it is about arming them with the freedom to talk about troubled kids whose behavior not only needs to be assessed, but when the behavior puts others at risk of serious harm, intervention other than therapy,” Ms. York said.Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who has been eyeing the guidance for reversal since she took office, will head a White House commission on school safety that has been specifically tasked with examining whether to repeal the discipline guidance.Civil rights groups and congressional Democrats are standing by the guidance and pointing to evidence that suspensions are helping to drive the achievement gap between white and minority students. Suspensions and expulsions are also linked to the disproportionate numbers of minority students in the criminal justice system.In a letter to Ms. DeVos, Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the top Democrat on the House Education Committee, said that her office was aware of a coming report from the Government Accountability Office that would “very likely substantiate claims” of a persistent inequality in the “treatments of students of color and students with disabilities.”“Ensuring public access to the G.A.O. findings prior to any agency action on the guidance is especially necessary given the recent factually inaccurate assertions that wrongly place blame for the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, on the 2014 guidance,” Mr. Scott wrote.But in Minneapolis, as in districts across the nation, discipline policies are more than a political flash point. They are a daily struggle to balance safety and statistics, and the uncomfortable truths about how race may be clouding educators’ perception of both.“We’re in a pressure cooker,” said Michael Thomas, the district’s chief of schools. “And what’s happening in Minneapolis is a microcosm of what’s happening across America.”While critics of the Obama-era discipline changes argue that disparities cannot be explained away by racism, education leaders here say it is the natural place to start.Bernadeia Johnson, a former Minneapolis schools superintendent, launched her own review of discipline referrals for kindergarten boys after the federal government began investigating her district. The review was revealing, she said. The descriptions of white children by teachers included “gifted but can’t use his words” and “high strung,” with their actions excused because they “had a hard day.”Black children, she said, were “destructive” and “violent,” and “cannot be managed.”“When you see something like that and you’re a leader, and you’re trying to figure out how to move the school system forward — it was alarming,” Ms. Johnson said.[ALSO READ: Extensive Data Shows Punishing Reach of Racism for Black Boys]Nationally, black students are suspended three times as often as their white peers; in Minnesota, it is eight times as often. To explain this trend, officials here point to the rapid increase in the state’s minority population in the last decade, and the fact that the state has the largest poverty gap between blacks and whites in the nation.Last month, the Minnesota Department of Human Rights notified 43 school districts and charter schools that suspension rates for nonviolent offenses still suggested widespread discriminatory practices.“We’re at a tipping point, and that’s what you see in the schools” said Kevin Lindsey, the state’s human rights commissioner.The school district is trying to engage students and educators in conversations, which they hope will help the situation.“Our students for years have been publicly expressing that they want to be seen differently, be judged equitably,” Mr. Thomas said. “We’re still adjusting our listening frequency.”But some teachers say that the approach has undermined their profession and set students up for failure. One case that has received particular attention is a student’s violent assault in 2016 of his teacher, John Ekblad. Last year, Mr. Ekblad was part of a Minnesota contingent of teachers who met with Trump administration officials to discuss Obama-era disciplinary policies.Simon Whitehead, a former physical education teacher at Southwest High School in Minneapolis, said he had watched the district’s discipline policy changes play out in his classes. Name-calling escalated to shoving, and then physical assaults. Profanity was redefined as “cultural dialect,” he said.“It threw the school into complete chaos,” he said. “The kids knew they weren’t going to go home.”Mr. Whitehead said he learned not to call his students out in front of their peers. He did not use the word “detention,” but rather “quality time.” Eventually, he would just “sweep a lot under the rug.”The discipline model that he said had worked for him for 25 years — a warning, then a consequence — was no longer recognized by his bosses. He retired last year, labeled a racist.“We do need to train teachers, especially white teachers, on how to interact with our African-American students,” he said. “But not expecting the same things from them is actually disrespectful. That would actually be racist.”The root of those changes was in the district’s 2014 settlement agreement with the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights, which had conducted a yearlong investigation into its discipline practices.Federal investigators found that a black second-grade student was suspended for one day for poking another student with a pencil, but a white second grader who threw a rock that hit another student and broke a teacher’s sunglasses was not. The white student was allowed to work off the cost of the sunglasses by helping the teacher at lunch for several days.Ms. Johnson ordered several policy changes amid the 2014 settlement, including a moratorium on suspensions for students in pre-K through first grade for nonviolent offenses, and she pledged to personally review referrals to suspend minority students for nonviolent offenses.The policy changes prompted a backlash both locally and nationally. In a letter, Peter Kirsanow, a Republican commissioner on the United States Commission on Civil Rights, called the move “legally and constitutionally suspect.” He said her goal of closing the discipline gap between black and white students by 2018 was “introducing a racial quota system for school discipline.”One month after the changes were announced, Ms. Johnson resigned.“When people have kids around them that don’t look like them, they want them controlled,” she said.The district’s agreement with the Education Department is still active, and it requires the district to continually review its discipline data and policies.There are bright spots.At Lyndale Community School, which has almost equal percentages of minority and white students, discipline is a “loaded term,” said the principal, Mark Stauduhar. He said his data — there were two suspensions in the school of more than 500 last year — showed that the school was a “healthy place” that emphasized positive reinforcement.When it comes to misbehavior, “the conversations are about a mistake that a child made, not something that’s wrong with them,” he said. Most important, he added, his staff members are all on the same page. “If students are demonstrating behaviors that are not aligned with our policy, it’s our job to figure out why.”But, in the district as a whole, after four years, and three superintendents, it has made meager progress. Suspensions have fallen, but racial disparities persist. Black students remain three times as likely to be suspended.Justice Page is one of the schools contributing to that gap, and Ms. Rathke and her team are working to change course.Fresh murals on the school walls depict students from different ethnic groups linking arms, a nod to the demographic shift that the school underwent three years ago when the district completed a merger of three racially and socioeconomically different schools.The school adopted a new curriculum this year that Ms. Rathke said had required teachers to reflect on how they were adjusting to a more diverse student body.“I think we have to challenge our own biases every day,” she said. “Some teachers aren’t ready; some teachers need more time. But I just tell them that we’re not going to give up on students, and I’m not going to give up on them.”There are signs of hope. Students successfully campaigned last year to rename the school for the state’s first black Supreme Court justice, Alan Page. It had previously been named for Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota’s first governor, who advocated genocide against Indian tribes.“We are more than these numbers,” Ms. Rathke said. “But they’re telling us something: We have students that we just haven’t figured out how to support yet.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/maine-republican-leslie-gibson.html","A Republican candidate for the Maine State House who disparaged two teenage survivors of the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., dropped out of the race after drawing heavy criticism and challengers from both political parties.The candidate, Leslie Gibson, had been running to represent District 57 in central Maine unopposed, according to The Sun Journal, which first reported the comments he made on Twitter. Mr. Gibson called one Florida student, Emma González, a “skinhead lesbian,” and another, David Hogg, a “moron” and a “baldfaced liar.”Some state lawmakers, including at least two Republicans, were quick to condemn Mr. Gibson after his comments surfaced. Mr. Hogg issued a call on Twitter for someone to run against Mr. Gibson. By Thursday, two challengers who had been dismayed by the remarks were scrambling to complete the paperwork needed to run for the seat before the filing deadline that night.By Friday, at least one Democrat, Eryn Gilchrist, and one Republican, Thomas H. Martin Jr., had entered the race and Mr. Gibson had withdrawn.Mr. Gibson could not be reached on Saturday and appeared to have deleted the personal Twitter account on which he made the remarks. But screenshots confirmed that a person with a Twitter handle bearing his name posted the disparaging tweets. Other screenshots of tweets from a locked account that appear to have been for Mr. Gibson’s campaign contained an apology.In the apologetic tweets, which were quoted by The Press Herald, Mr. Gibson acknowledged that his responses were “harsh and uncivil” and said it was “inappropriate to single out” the students.Mr. Martin, who served as a state senator in another district in 2011 and 2012 before losing a re-election bid, said he had considered running for office again but had not planned to do it so soon because he and his wife had just moved to the area and had adopted a baby boy.Still, he said that after Mr. Gibson’s comments, he got calls from friends urging him to run and decided that he “couldn’t sit idle and let our state be reflected so negatively.”The comments “gave the state a black eye,” Mr. Martin said.“They weren’t the true feelings of the state or the Republican Party — or any party — I have to believe,” he said, adding that he planned to contact the Parkland students and commend their courage.A spokesman for the Maine Republican Party did not return an email requesting comment on Saturday.In a statement from the Maine Democratic Party, Ms. Gilchrist said she had not considered running for office before she read Mr. Gibson’s comments. After she did, she said, she thought constituents in the district “deserved a representative who will respect people and try to work through their differences to make our lives better.”In the wake of the shooting last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which killed 17 people, Ms. González, 18, and Mr. Hogg, 17, emerged as two of the most forceful student activists agitating for gun control.Mr. Hogg’s early remark that “we’re children” while politicians “are the adults” won him praise. Ms. González’s speech soon after made the phrase “We call B.S.” a rallying cry among young people. Since then, the Parkland students’ ability to leverage social media to command the narrative and keep gun control in the news has been widely recognized.Ms. González did not return a phone message on Saturday night and did not appear to have responded to Mr. Gibson on Twitter directly. She did share a tweet from one of her fellow students who said Mr. Gibson’s decision to drop out of the race was “what he deserves.”Mr. Hogg said his mother had seen a story about what Mr. Gibson had called Ms. González and he had quickly sent the tweet asking someone to challenge Mr. Gibson.“If you’re the type of person who calls children who are a witness to murder a skinhead lesbian and baldfaced liar, that kind of speaks for itself,” he said on Saturday. “It’s disgusting, but honestly, I’m a super petty person, and we all cheered when he said that he dropped out.”“We need good people in office — people who are actually human and have an ounce of empathy,” he continued. “It’s hilarious because its ridiculous. They’re only proving our point that there are so many bad politicians out there. We almost let somebody that would say something like that win and run unopposed.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/us/politics/nancy-pelosi-democrats-candidates.html","WASHINGTON — A few hours after Conor Lamb, the Pennsylvania Democrat, claimed victory in a House race with a vow to oppose his party’s leader, Nancy Pelosi, the once-and-perhaps-future speaker was explaining to a group of female congressional candidates why she did not retire after 2016.She intended to do so after Hillary Clinton won, Ms. Pelosi recalled Wednesday at a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee reception here. But she stayed to ensure Washington had at least one woman in power.To some lawmakers in the room who described her remarks, the message was clear: Ms. Pelosi is not going anywhere — a point she underscored in an interview.Yet her resolve is at odds with growing numbers of Democratic candidates who view her as politically toxic and are pledging to vote against her as their leader, as Mr. Lamb did without suffering consequences with voters and donors. These candidates and some current House Democrats — tired of years of attack ads invoking Ms. Pelosi as a “San Francisco liberal,” and impatient to see a younger set of leaders take power — are now openly distancing themselves from Ms. Pelosi or declaring outright that it is time for her to go.Mr. Lamb, by coming out early against Ms. Pelosi and scoring an upset win in a district President Trump carried by nearly 20 percentage points, has clearly emboldened some other Democrats to follow suit and disavow her. Republicans intend to make Ms. Pelosi’s unpopularity a centerpiece of their 2018 strategy, hoping that her polarizing status will mitigate their predicted losses.Anticipating this strategy from the right, Democratic candidates are increasingly opposing her as speaker or refusing to take a stand as an act of political inoculation — a trend that even her allies acknowledge could ultimately imperil her grip on the Democratic caucus.At least two other senior Democrats, Representatives Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland and Joseph Crowley of New York, are already actively laying the groundwork to seek the leader’s job if Ms. Pelosi’s position becomes untenable.As Democratic House candidates descended on Washington last week for a round of training and fund-raising, the topic of how to confront the Pelosi question came up repeatedly, according to multiple officials.“I was just in D.C. and that’s the advice everybody gives: Don’t say you’re for Pelosi,” recalled former Representative Brad Ashford, a Nebraska Democrat trying to reclaim his seat. (He would not rule out backing Ms. Pelosi.)Most ominous for Ms. Pelosi, it is not just centrist candidates running in red-tinged districts who are reluctant to embrace her, but also political insurgents on the left who see her as an embodiment of the Washington establishment.“I would have to see who’s running,” said Marie Newman, a progressive Democratic House candidate in Illinois, when asked if she would support Ms. Pelosi for speaker. Ms. Newman is vying to unseat Representative Daniel Lipinski, a conservative Chicago Democrat, in a primary there on Tuesday.And on Capitol Hill, Ms. Pelosi, 77, must contend with colleagues from her own generation who want their turn in charge, as well as younger Democrats who’d prefer to clear out the party’s entire septuagenarian leadership team: beyond Ms. Pelosi, the other two ranking House Democrats, Mr. Hoyer and James E. Clyburn, are 78 and 77.Yet at a time when women are at the forefront of the opposition to Mr. Trump’s presidency — volunteering, donating and running for office in record numbers — the specter of Democrats taking back the House only to unceremoniously dump the most powerful woman in American politics strikes many in the party as outrageous.And Ms. Pelosi herself is plainly in this camp.“I’m a woman at the table,” she said in the interview Friday before getting on a plane for Houston, where she was going to raise money for House Democrats at the annual rodeo there.Demonstrating the swagger that delights her admirers and prompts eye-rolling from detractors, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats needed her in charge.“I am a master legislator, I am a shrewd politician and I have a following in the country that, apart from a presidential candidate, nobody else can claim,” she said.While she would not firmly commit to seeking the speakership again, it is clearly her plan, and she even gave voice to a concern on the minds of many Democrats: the chaotic scramble that would ensue if she steps down.“If I was to walk away now, this caucus would be in such a musical chairs scenario,” she said.Even as energy on the left has soared across the country thanks to Mr. Trump, tensions among House Democrats are brewing inside the Capitol. Should Democrats fail to reclaim the House in a year with so many factors in their favor, Ms. Pelosi and her long-serving lieutenants will almost certainly be pushed to step down.Yet some in the caucus want to see new leadership no matter what. Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, hosted Mr. Crowley at a St. Patrick’s Day-themed event last week and unexpectedly announced that he would back Mr. Crowley for leader. Mr. Pascrell, 81, said the culture of the House was changing.“A lot of new people will be coming in and I think we should start fresh,” Mr. Pascrell said, adding almost apologetically of Ms. Pelosi: “She’s taken a lot of crap from Republicans and Democrats and she’s really been above it all.”Representative Filemon Vela, a Texas Democrat, said he had also encouraged Mr. Crowley to run for speaker.“Having Joe be the leader of this party next session would be a welcome change,” said Mr. Vela, 55, adding that Ms. Pelosi “hurts our candidates” in competitive districts.For his part, Mr. Crowley has been inviting groups of younger lawmakers to meet for coffee and pastries in his office, reaching out to high-profile newer members like Joaquin Castro of Texas and Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts.In an interview, Mr. Crowley declined to rule out taking on Ms. Pelosi. Asked if he was seeking commitments for a future race, Mr. Crowley said only that “I have been talking to my colleagues about what they and we can do to help put us in the majority.”Ms. Pelosi dismissed the idea of a challenge from Mr. Crowley, who briefly considered challenging her after the 2016 election, and her aides pointedly noted that at an event in New York last week, he introduced her as “soon to be speaker again.”Mr. Hoyer, in turn, has pitched himself to colleagues as a transitional House speaker, according to multiple lawmakers who have spoken with him — a steady hand through the 2020 elections, and perhaps no further. Katie Grant, his spokeswoman, said he was “focused on taking back the House.”Part of Ms. Pelosi’s challenge owes to the changing nature of fund-raising: Mr. Lamb raised over $4 million from mostly online contributors, the same way other Democrats are attracting donations. That has raised questions about just how much Ms. Pelosi’s vaunted fund-raising prowess still matters.“It weakens the leverage of party leaders,” Representative Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who challenged Ms. Pelosi after the 2016 elections, said of the new fund-raising tools.Yet some Democrats predicted that if the party rides an electoral wave back to power, Ms. Pelosi would reap much of the credit.“If we take the majority, I completely assume that Leader Pelosi will be Speaker Pelosi,” said Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California.The most plausible scenario for Ms. Pelosi to exit, Democrats believe, is one in which the party just barely wins control of the House. A number of new lawmakers would have pledged not to vote for her, and several Democrats oppose her as a matter of routine, potentially denying her the 218 votes needed to secure the speakership.“I think it will be left up to the new membership,” said Representative John Lewis of Georgia, noting that freshman lawmakers and the rest of the caucus should “work their will.” That could doom Ms. Pelosi, especially if more Democrats follow Mr. Lamb’s approach.At least three of the Democrats’ “red to blue” candidates — recruits designated as top priorities by the D.C.C.C. — have signaled they would prefer a leader other than Ms. Pelosi. In Minnesota, Dean Phillips, a wealthy businessman challenging Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican, has called for a “new generation of leadership.” In Washington State, Lisa Brown, a former state senator who is challenging Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the Republican leadership, said “there’s room for new blood in all the caucuses in Congress.”And Paul Davis, who is running for an open seat in Kansas, is flatly opposed to Ms. Pelosi. He said a change was “badly needed” and lamented leaders who are “toxic in this part of the country.”But there is unease with Ms. Pelosi in solid-blue districts, too. In two Boston-area districts, neither the Democratic incumbents nor their more progressive rivals have committed to backing Ms. Pelosi. Brianna Wu, a liberal activist opposing Representative Stephen F. Lynch in a Democratic primary, said she was worried Democrats would suffer from Ms. Pelosi’s “inability to express a vision for the party.”Representative Kurt Schrader of Oregon, a moderate Democrat, said he had encouraged other congressional hopefuls to oppose Ms. Pelosi if necessary.“I have liberals back home, the one thing they really like about me is the fact that I voted against Nancy,” he said. “No matter what candidate you are, it’s not necessarily a bad message.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/obituaries/adrian-lamo-dead.html","Adrián Lamo, a hacker best known for breaking into the computer networks of The New York Times and other major corporations, and for reporting the Army whistle-blower Chelsea Manning to the authorities, was found dead on Wednesday in Wichita, Kan. He was 37.Mr. Lamo’s body was discovered in an apartment in the city, The Wichita Eagle reported. His father announced the death in a post on Facebook on Friday. Kate Flavin, a spokeswoman for Sedgwick County, Kan., said on Saturday that the cause of death was unknown.Mr. Lamo was 22 when federal prosecutors accused him of breaking into The Times’s computer network, creating fake usernames and running up over $300,000 in data research fees. Mr. Lamo also gained access to the computer networks of Yahoo, Microsoft and Cingular Wireless, prosecutors said.“It’s like someone kicking in your front door while you’re on vacation and running up a $300,000 bill on your phone, and then telling you when you arrive home that he had performed a useful service by demonstrating that your deadbolt wasn’t secure enough,” James B. Comey, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in 2003, referring to Mr. Lamo’s activities.Mr. Lamo pleaded guilty to one count of computer damage, telling a federal judge that he was “genuinely remorseful” for his actions. He was sentenced to house arrest and probation.Mr. Lamo was never a “malicious hacker,” his father, Mario Lamo, said in a message, adding, “Everything that he did was out of curiosity.” The younger Mr. Lamo told Wired magazine in 2010 that he had Asperger’s syndrome.In 2010, Ms. Manning, an Army private, contacted Mr. Lamo via instant message. They chatted for a week about her personal problems in the military. Ms. Manning admitted that she had leaked classified video of a helicopter attack in Baghdad that left 12 people dead, including two Reuters employees, to WikiLeaks.org, which published the video online under the title “Collateral Murder.”Mr. Lamo said Ms. Manning had also admitted leaking to WikiLeaks 260,000 classified diplomatic cables and video of a 2009 Afghanistan airstrike that left 96 people dead.“He was just grabbing information from where he could get it and trying to leak it,” Mr. Lamo told The  Times in 2010 about Ms. Manning, a transgender woman who was then known as Bradley Manning.Mr. Lamo called the F.B.I. and relayed Ms. Manning’s admissions. She was arrested and eventually sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking over 700,000 government records, the longest punishment ever imposed for a leak conviction. President Barack Obama commuted Ms. Manning’s sentence in January 2017, and she recently filed to run for the United States Senate in Maryland.Mr. Lamo said he was worried that the leaks provided by Ms. Manning would endanger people’s lives.“I thought to myself, ‘What if somebody dies because this information is leaked?’” he said in 2010.WikiLeaks and others condemned Mr. Lamo for turning Ms. Manning in to the federal authorities.Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, called Mr. Lamo a “serial F.B.I. snitch” on Twitter. In comments on the Facebook post announcing Mr. Lamo’s death, some called him a “real hero” and “true patriot.”Mario Lamo said his son went through a difficult period after reporting Ms. Manning to the authorities.“He was vilified by many people by his position about the Manning affair,” he said. “I was with him when this happened and understood that he lived by some principles and he stood for them.”Adrián Alfonso Lamo Atwood was born in Malden, Mass., on Feb. 20, 1981. He attended high school in San Francisco before being expelled after altercations with his computer teacher.Mario Lamo said his son went on to obtain his high school equivalency diploma and later became friends with the computer teacher.Mr. Lamo first became interested in computers after receiving a hand-me-down Commodore 64. He became familiar with software after gaining access to the coding used to create the video games that he played.After receiving his first laptop computer in high school, Mr. Lamo began using a simple web browser to find holes in security. Mr. Lamo would report the security holes he uncovered to the affected companies. Until his death, Mario Lamo said, his son worked as a computer security consultant.In addition to his father, Mr. Lamo is survived by his mother, Mary Atwood, and two siblings, Andrea Lamo Atwood and Julián Lamo Atwood.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-russia.html","When the Russia question came up during a hearing at the British Parliament last month, Alexander Nix did not hesitate.“We’ve never worked in Russia,” said Mr. Nix, head of a data consulting firm that advised the Trump campaign on targeting voters.“As far as I’m aware, we’ve never worked for a Russian company,” Mr. Nix added. “We’ve never worked with a Russian organization in Russia or any other country, and we don’t have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”But Mr. Nix’s business did have some dealings with Russian interests, according to company documents and interviews.Mr. Nix is a director of SCL Group, a British political and defense contractor, and chief executive of its American offshoot, Cambridge Analytica, which advised the Trump campaign. The firms’ employees, who often overlap, had contact in 2014 and 2015 with executives from Lukoil, the Russian oil giant.Lukoil was interested in how data was used to target American voters, according to two former company insiders who said there were at least three meetings with Lukoil executives in London and Turkey. SCL and Lukoil denied that the talks were political in nature, and SCL also said there were no meetings in London.The contacts took place as Cambridge Analytica was building a roster of Republican clients in the United States — and harvesting the Facebook profiles of over 50 million users to develop tools to analyze voters’ behavior.Cambridge Analytica also included extensive questions about Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, in surveys it was carrying out in American focus groups in 2014. It is not clear what — or which client — prompted the line of questioning, which asked for views on topics ranging from Mr. Putin’s popularity to Russian expansionism.On two promotional documents obtained by The New York Times, SCL said it did business in Russia. In both documents, the country is highlighted on world maps that specify the location of SCL clients, with one of the maps noting that the clients were for the firm’s elections division. In a statement, SCL said an employee had done “commercial work” about 25 years ago “for a private company in Russia.”Cambridge Analytica has been a political flash point since its role in the Trump campaign attracted scrutiny after the election. While Mr. Nix’s firm turned over some records to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence during its investigation of Russian interference, Democrats on the committee want a fuller review. “It is imperative to interview a broader range of individuals employed by or linked to Cambridge Analytica,” they said in a report this month.Asked about the Russian oil company, a spokesman for SCL said that in 2014 the firm’s commercial division “discussed helping Lukoil Turkey better engage with its loyalty-card customers at gas stations.” The spokesman said SCL was not ultimately hired.Arash Repac, chief executive of Lukoil Eurasia Petrol, offered a different explanation for the talks. He said that a meeting he attended with SCL in Turkey involved a promotional campaign with local soccer teams.“We needed somebody to guide us with the customer data that we were collecting,” he wrote in response to a question from The Times. “Even though our campaign went ahead, we decided not to cooperate with SCL. No contracts were signed.”But Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica and develop the company’s voter-profiling technology, said Lukoil showed interest in how the company used data to tailor messaging to American voters.“I remember being super confused,” said Mr. Wylie, who took part in one of the Lukoil meetings.“I kept asking Alexander, ‘Can you explain to me what they want?’” he said, referring to Mr. Nix. “I don’t understand why Lukoil wants to know about political targeting in America.”“We’re sending them stuff about political targeting — they then come and ask more about political targeting,” Mr. Wylie said, adding that Lukoil “just didn’t seem to be interested” in how the techniques could be used commercially.Mr. Wylie, a former contractor, left SCL before the talks concluded and could not say what became of the relationship with the oil company. He had a falling out with SCL and tried to set up a rival business. SCL said he had violated a nondisclosure agreement and that his comments were an attempt to hurt the company.A second person familiar with the discussions backed up Mr. Wylie’s account, but spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement.Though Lukoil is not state-owned, it depends on Kremlin support, and its chief executive, Vagit Alekperov, has met with Mr. Putin on a number of occasions. Reuters reported last year that Lukoil and other companies received instructions from the state energy ministry on providing news stories favorable to Russian leadership.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/business/trump-organization-russia-mueller.html","The investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election has expanded to include President Trump’s family business, with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, subpoenaing the Trump Organization for documents related to Russia.For more than 30 years, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to conduct business in Russia. He traveled to Moscow in 1987 to explore building a hotel. He applied for his trademark in the country as early as 1996. And his children and associates have met with Russian developers and government officials on multiple occasions in search of joint ventures.But the company says nothing has come of it. Mr. Trump tweeted in January last year, shortly before his inauguration: “I HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA — NO DEALS, NO LOANS, NO NOTHING!”So what about the Trump Organization’s Russian connections might be of interest to Mr. Mueller?There Was a Moscow Hotel Deal in the Works During the CampaignPerhaps the closest Mr. Trump came to launching a real estate project in Russia was during the presidential campaign, when he signed a letter of intent in late 2015 for a Trump hotel to be built in Moscow. Ultimately, the deal never materialized.In email exchanges with Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, Felix Sater, a Russian émigré who had previously helped develop Trump SoHo in New York, talked about securing financing for the Moscow project from VTB, a major state-owned Russian bank under American sanctions. He also mused about how the deal, if supported by Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, would “fix relations between the countries by showing everyone that commerce & business are much better and more practical than politics.”“I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected,” Mr. Sater wrote in one of the emails.Mr. Trump signed the letter of intent with Andrey Rozov, a developer of retail and residential projects in the Moscow region. If the deal went through, Mr. Trump would receive a $4 million upfront fee in exchange for licensing his name, and his company would manage the completed hotel.By January 2016, the project seemed to have stalled. At one point, without success, Mr. Cohen emailed an aide to Mr. Putin seeking help jump-starting it. There is no evidence the Kremlin provided any assistance for the project.The Trump Organization has said that it received no government approvals or financing and that the effort was abandoned in early 2016.Mr. Trump Took Miss Universe to Moscow and ‘Met the Top People’Mr. Trump’s business opportunities in Russia got little traction until he took the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013.A father-son pair of real estate developers, Aras and Emin Agalarov, paid nearly $20 million to license the Miss Universe name, bringing the contest to their Crocus City Hall in Moscow. As an owner of the pageant, Mr. Trump flew to Russia in November 2013 to participate. He became friendly with his partners, who were known to have been helpful to the Kremlin.The visit left an impression on Mr. Trump and had him contemplating future endeavors with the Agalarovs.“I had a great weekend with you and your family,” Mr. Trump posted on Twitter in a message to Aras Agalarov. “You have done a FANTASTIC job. TRUMP TOWER-MOSCOW is next,” he wrote, before referring to Mr. Agalarov’s son, a pop star: “EMIN was WOW!”While the plans for the tower were apparently shelved during the campaign, Mr. Trump and the Agalarovs maintained their friendship.In June 2016, a publicist for Emin Agalarov requested that Donald Trump Jr. meet with a Kremlin-connected lawyer. That meeting, at Trump Tower in New York, first reported by The New York Times last July, included other campaign officials and has been the subject of considerable scrutiny.After the disclosure of the meeting, the president downplayed his ties to the Agalarovs in an interview with The Times. But in a September 2015 interview on “The Hugh Hewitt Show,” he had made the Miss Universe pageant seem far more important.“I called it my weekend in Moscow,” Mr. Trump said. “I was with the top-level people, both oligarchs and generals, and top-of-the-government people. I can’t go further than that, but I will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was extraordinary.”The Trumps’ German Bank Paid Fines in a Russian Money-Laundering CaseTwo decades ago, Mr. Trump was a persona non grata on Wall Street. His casino and hotel businesses had suffered some bankruptcies, and his lenders were grumbling that he had stiffed them.But one giant German bank stepped up as a willing partner.Over the years, that institution, Deutsche Bank, offered Mr. Trump more than $4 billion in loan commitments and potential bond offerings, a majority of which were completed, The Times reported last year.There is no indication of a Russian connection to Mr. Trump’s loans or accounts at Deutsche Bank, and there is no public evidence that Mr. Mueller has subpoenaed the bank for records about Mr. Trump.But the bank last year landed in legal trouble over Russian money laundering — paying more than $600 million in penalties to American and British regulators.Some Deutsche Bank executives expect they will eventually have to produce records as part of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry, The Times  reported last July. The bank has already been asked to turn over documents to federal prosecutors in Brooklyn about another client with a White House connection: the Kushner Companies, the family business of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and adviser.A Russian Oligarch Bought a Trump Mansion at a High PriceDmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian billionaire oligarch, paid $95 million for Mr. Trump’s oceanfront mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., one of two sources of income from Russians that Mr. Trump’s lawyers have said were reflected in his income tax returns. (The other was $12.2 million in payments in connection with holding the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow.)The Palm Beach deal was unusual for several reasons.Mr. Trump sold the house less than four years after buying it for about $41 million. Mr. Rybolovlev paid the markup despite buying the property in 2008, at the height of the housing crisis. And Mr. Trump had made few improvements to the mansion, which reportedly had a mold problem.Mr. Rybolovlev, moreover, never lived in the property.At the time of the sale, Mr. Trump was facing financial pressure. He potentially owed Deutsche Bank $40 million after not paying off a loan for his Chicago hotel and tower.The Florida property later featured prominently in Mr. Rybolovlev’s divorce.Mr. Rybolovlev’s wife sought control of the mansion, saying he had bought it partly to hide money from her in the divorce, a claim he denied.He has since demolished the mansion and divided the property into different parcels that he is selling. The new owners are hidden behind murky layers of trusts and other legal entities.A spokesman for Mr. Rybolovlev disputed that he overpaid for the property, saying that the sale was negotiated down from an asking price of $125 million and that it predated an upheaval in the Palm Beach real estate market. The spokesman also said that the property was acquired by a family trust “specifically and explicitly for investment purposes,” and that depending on the sale price of the final lot, the investment might “end up yielding a decent return.”There Were Boasts That Russian Money Helped Pay for Golf Courses and Other ProjectsIn the past decade, the Trump Organization has bought and refurbished several golf courses around the world, but the financing behind those deals remains something of a mystery. A respected golf writer says that Eric Trump, a son of Mr. Trump’s who is now helping to run the Trump Organization, told him the money came from Russia.Last year, during an interview on Boston public radio, the golf journalist James Dodson recounted a conversation he had had with Eric Trump in 2013 on a newly opened Trump golf course in Charlotte, N.C. Mr. Dodson said he had asked Mr. Trump about the company’s sources of funds, and Mr. Trump told him, “We have pretty much all the money we need from investors in Russia.”Eric Trump has denied making the comment about Russia, but several of Mr. Dodson’s friends and colleagues confirmed that Mr. Dodson relayed the anecdote to them shortly after the conversation took place.It was not the first time that one of Mr. Trump’s sons made a similar claim. In 2008, at a real estate conference in New York, Donald Trump Jr. said: “In terms of high-end product influx into the U.S., Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets, say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York. We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.”

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/19/594164065/trump-cabinet-turnover-sets-record-going-back-100-years","Last week, when #firingFriday was trending on Twitter and White House aides had to be reassured by the chief of staff that no changes were imminent, President Trump embraced the uncertainty in public statements. His willingness to say ""you're fired"" to so many people, so early in his administration, is just another way Trump is unlike those who have come before him.No elected first-term president in the past 100 years has had this much Cabinet turnover this early in his presidency. And going back to Ronald Reagan, the churn in top-level staff in the Trump White House is off the charts.""There will always be change, and I think you want to see change,"" Trump said Thursday, not quite tamping down the latest rumors of possible Cabinet departures. ""And I want to also see different ideas.""In just under 14 months on the job, Trump has had more Cabinet turnover than 14 of his predecessors had in their first two years. Trump has already tied Presidents Ford and Harding, with three departures each. Ronald Reagan had four Cabinet departures and they all came well into his second year in office. The three Cabinet members Trump has already replaced are Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who was pushed out after controversy over flying in charter aircraft; Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who became chief of staff over the summer; and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who was fired by tweet recently over policy and personality clashes.Several other members of the Cabinet are either clouded in controversy over possible misuse of public funds or otherwise earning the ire of President Trump. Other presidents with early Cabinet turnover saw departures for entirely different reasons.Herbert Hoover's first war secretary, James Good, died suddenly 258 days into his tenure. Franklin D. Roosevelt's first treasury secretary, William Woodin, fell ill, writing after just nine months on the job ""the state of my health will not permit me to remain in this position."" He died a few months later.Over the approximately 100-year period reviewed for this story, there were Cabinet shake-ups and shuffles, secretaries who departed to take on new roles either in the administration or on the Supreme Court. There were resignations amidst policy disagreements, and perhaps most remarkably there was an agriculture secretary who served in the job for less than 90 days, while waiting to take office as governor of West Virginia.First term ""dream team""Typically in the first two years, a president has his dream team Cabinet in place and they are working hard to enact his vision. Then midterm elections come, people get tired and Cabinet shake-ups begin.""Other presidents wanted to save face for themselves and not look like their Cabinet is in disarray,"" said James Pfiffner, explaining one of many possible reasons for the typical early stability in presidential Cabinets.Pfiffner is a professor of public policy at George Mason University who specializes in presidents and their Cabinets. Also, he says most presidents have a political background and choose Cabinet members they know and are compatible with who have long-established histories navigating Washington, D.C. Trump's original Cabinet included a number of outsiders, perhaps most notably Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who came from Exxon Mobil and who Trump didn't know beforehand.""President Trump doesn't pay much attention to tradition or usual decorum or norms of the presidency,"" Pfiffner said, pointing out that Trump puts a premium on personal rapport. ""And so he does what he feels like, and continues to.""For this analysis, NPR looked at the first two years of Cabinet departures for presidents going back to Woodrow Wilson. We didn't count holdovers from previous administrations (especially prevalent when a president took over following a death or resignation), instead focusing on Senate-confirmed secretaries in each president's first two years and how long they lasted. Which jobs are considered Cabinet positions has changed over time, so we opted to use the same definition as the U.S. Senate historian. This means Trump's chief of staff and CIA director aren't part of the count, and neither is the administrator of the Small Business Administration (a position presidents Clinton and Carter had to refill early on).As to whether Trump's tally of turnover is likely to rise anytime soon, press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked whether the president had offered assurances about job security to VA Secretary David Shulkin or HUD Secretary Ben Carson. And all she would say was: ""We don't have any personnel changes at this time."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/18/594702972/trump-continues-barrage-against-special-counsel-mueller-fired-fbi-deputy-mccabe","Updated at 9:15 p.m. ETCongressional Republicans say they still support special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian election interference even as the president continued his offensive Sunday against the investigation, as well as a recently fired high-ranking FBI official, Andrew McCabe.Trump sent a flurry of tweets Sunday morning, in which he painted the Mueller-led special counsel probe as a politically biased witch hunt.""Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?"" Trump said. ""Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!""Mueller is a Republican who has served under presidents of both parties. Department of Justice regulations do not consider partisan affiliation when assigning employees but do stipulate that DoJ personnel in sensitive posts are not allowed to participate in political campaigns or ""engage in political activity.""On Saturday, the President said the Mueller investigation ""should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,"" and Trump's personal lawyer, John Dowd, said the investigation should end.Late Sunday, however, White House Special Counsel Ty Cobb released a statement to the media saying that the ""President is not considering or discussing the firing of the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller.""Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., noted on NBC's Meet The Press on Sunday that figuring out whether Trump's 2016 campaign coordinated with Russia is only a section of Mueller's task, which is to investigate the Russian government's overall efforts to interfere with the election.""It is not a collusion probe. It is much broader than that,"" Rubio said. ""I remain confident that the special counsel is going to conduct a probe that is fair and thorough and is going to arrive at the truth.""Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CNN's Jake Tapper that he thought Mueller was ""doing a good job"" and that if Trump fired him, it ""would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, because we are a rule-of-laws nation.""""When it comes to Mr. Mueller, he is following the evidence where it takes him and I think it's very important he be allowed to do his job without interference,"" Graham said. ""And there are many Republicans who share my view.""And Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, of South Carolina, told Fox News' Chris Wallace that Dowd should not be advising the President to push Mueller to end the investigation.""If you've done nothing wrong you should want the investigation to be as wholesome and thorough as possible,"" Gowdy said.Democrats also came out against the notion that Trump could be moving toward finding a way to end the investigation.""The president is floating trial balloons about derailing the Mueller investigation,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. ""Our Republican colleagues, particularly the leadership, have an obligation to our country to stand up now and make it clear that firing Mueller is a red line for our democracy that cannot be crossed.""Not all lawmakers were convinced, however, that Dowd's statement and Trump's tweets added up to an actual effort to derail the probe.Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., said on ABC's This Week, ""I don't see the president firing [Mueller]. I think the White House has said 10 times, maybe more that they are not going to fire Robert Mueller.""They want him to be able to finish the investigation.""McCabe MemosOn Sunday morning, Trump also said the former deputy director of the FBI, Andrew McCabe, may have been lying when he claimed to have notes about their interactions.McCabe was fired Friday night, by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, less than 48 hours before his planned retirement from the bureau. Sessions said he fired McCabe because the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility found that he lied under oath ""on multiple occasions.""In a statement, McCabe claimed his dismissal was politically-motivated and that he had been targeted because ""he can corroborate former [FBI] Director [James] Comey's accounts of his discussions with the President.""A source familiar with the issue told NPR that McCabe had taken notes and memos about his interactions with President Trump. The notes could play a role as Mueller's team investigates whether Trump obstructed justice in firing Comey last year, when Comey was in charge of the Russia investigation as head of the FBI.The source told NPR that McCabe's notes corroborate Comey's account of events last year, which notably include President Trump asking Comey for loyalty.Trump, however, isn't sold that McCabe's notes, or Comey's, were actually taken at the time they say they were.""Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,"" Trump said. ""I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?""After sending out three tweets on Sunday morning, Trump went to the golf course that bears his name in Sterling, Va."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/18/594321235/ohio-democrat-marcy-kaptur-makes-history-as-longest-serving-woman-in-the-house","Marcy Kaptur didn't plan for this.First elected in 1982, the Ohio Democrat didn't set out to become the longest-serving woman in House history.""The reasons that I ran, to change certain practices and policies, [I thought] could be done much more quickly,"" she said in an interview with NPR. On Sunday, Kaptur becomes the longest-serving woman ever to serve in the chamber with a tenure that spans 35 years, two months and 15 days.Capitol Hill can be a tough place to navigate for any junior legislator, even more so for a woman elected in the early years of the Reagan era. In her Rayburn office, Kaptur keeps a silver-framed photograph of the 1983 swearing-in ceremony on the House floor, presided over by then-Speaker Tip O'Neill, D-Mass.""That's me, right there,"" she says chuckling, pointing to a tiny, female head in the background of the House chamber, surrounded mostly by white men. ""Look it — compared to today.""Thirty-five years later, Kaptur is not so alone. Women and minorities now make up a majority of the House Democratic Caucus. This year, an unprecedented number of women are running for Congress and Kaptur sees a female wave on the horizon.""I think this is going to be another watershed year for women,"" she says. ""I think the climate is such that we can elect many more women here come November.""Awaiting those future legislators is the same reality check Kaptur learned a long time ago.""You get here and it's like you run into this big marshmallow, this mammoth marshmallow,"" she says. ""And it kind of absorbs you, and it's so hard to work your way through in order to get passage to do something different for the country.""Kaptur keeps one reminder of this ""Marshmallow Maxim"" in her Rayburn office. Hanging on the wall is a poster-sized aerial view of the World War II Memorial on the National Mall.""I have it here to remind me how long it took us to do something the American people wanted,"" she says. Kaptur wrote the bill to create the memorial — 1987. Seventeen years later, it opened to the public. ""I look at that and it reminds me how long it takes to do something good.""It's a lesson the women who came to Congress before Kaptur had to learn, too. She takes the longest-serving woman title from the late Rep. Edith Nourse Rogers, R-Mass.House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., paid tribute to both on the floor this week, saying: ""Edith Nourse Rogers famously summed up her time in office by saying this: 'The first 30 years are the hardest. You start it and you like the work and you just keep on.' Marcy, you have certainly kept on.""After 35 years in Washington, Kaptur reflects on her career without any apparent cynicism. She still marvels at the advancements she's made in her own life. ""I was rejected when I applied to the U.S. Air Force Academy, to Notre Dame University when I was first seeking to go to college, and to the FBI because I was a woman,"" she says.That was Kaptur's reality as a young woman. This is her reality now, as a senior lawmaker: ""Now I'm able to appoint women to our service academies. Obviously I defend the FBI here, especially of late, I recognize how important they are to the country, and Notre Dame now accepts women. So we've seen this change just in my lifetime, and it's a good thing.""At 71, Kaptur says she has no sights on retirement.""Well, I'm not finished with what I started to do,"" she explains."

However, ""Tax records filed a few months later showed the company inherited as many as 94 rent-regulated units from the previous owner,"" AP said.Properties with rent-controlled apartments are subject to greater oversight for construction permits and ""possibly unscheduled 'sweeps' on site by inspectors to keep the company from harassing tenants and getting them to leave,"" the news agency reports.Bloomberg reports that while Kushner divested some of his assets when he joined the White House, his stakes in three Astoria, Queens, properties that are the focus of the AP report were not among them.""While none of the documents during a three-year period when Kushner was CEO bore his personal signature, they provide a window into the ethics of the business empire he ran before he went on to become one of the most trusted advisers to the president of the United States,"" according to the news agency.Current and former tenants in those buildings told the AP that they had been ""subjected to extensive construction, with banging, drilling, dust and leaking water that they believe were part of targeted harassment to get them to leave and clear the way for higher-paying renters.""Responding to the report, Kushner Cos. said its government filings are handled by third parties subject to independent review and that ""If mistakes or violations are identified, corrective action is taken immediately."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/18/594281192/with-centrist-democrats-success-party-s-identity-struggle-gets-more-complicated","Democrats are having a moment. They managed to win a House seat in Republican-leaning, industrial Pennsylvania and a Senate seat in the deep-red state of Alabama.Party leaders say those back-to-back special elections are proof that GOP-friendly centrists can win as Democrats in some races, even as the party is welcoming a growing number of progressives. They hope that strategy will help them win control in Congress in 2018, but some Democrats worry a big tent identity will make it harder for the party to unify when it comes time to elect a president. There are many Democrats showing interest across the party — from former Vice President Joe Biden to California Sen. Kamala Harris to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.Those worries were on the back burner last week after Democrat Conor Lamb edged out Republican Rick Saccone for a House seat from a conservative pocket of Pennsylvania. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., said Conor Lamb's apparent victory in Pennsylvania is clear proof that Democrats are on their way to a year of big victories.""These results should terrify Republicans,"" Lujan said in a statement. ""We have incredible candidates with deep records of service running deep into the map this year.""That big tent, including centrists, could become a liability as Democrats try to capitalize a groundswell of grass-roots, progressive activism from gun control and immigration to renewed activism among female voters motivated by opposition to President Trump.A big tent or political circus?""Welcome to the Democratic Party,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said last week while discussing tensions within the party.""It's what we're used to,"" she said. ""It's our strength.""Democrats are juggling a record number of candidates running in more congressional districts than they have seen in decades. That means they get to fine-tune and hone candidates to make sure they have the best fit for many districts.The big tent atmosphere has been a challenge for Democrats in the past, and some have warned that there is a risk in courting the party's left flank.They compare it with the 2010 Tea Party movement. That group of conservatives helped Republicans win control of the House, but their far-right ideology is at odds with GOP centrists. That division has created deep splits within the GOP and led to countless intraparty standoffs that have stymied legislative achievements.The greater risk comes in a presidential year when Democrats will need to unite behind a single candidate. That was a challenge in 2016 when the split between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in the primary continued to divide Democrats when they tried to unite behind Clinton in November.Betting on the centerDemocrats expanded their tent last week with Lamb's success. He is personally anti-abortion and supports the Second Amendment. Lamb says he will vote for abortion rights when he takes office, keeping him in line with the party, but he does not support Pelosi. Still, she welcomed him with open arms.""We're very excited about welcoming a new member from Pennsylvania,"" Pelosi said Thursday. ""Conor Lamb's upset victory is a tribute to his extraordinary personal record and story.""Running Democrats for Congress in southwestern Pennsylvania had become so increasingly futile that, in recent elections, the party had given up trying. Republican Rep. Tim Murphy ran unopposed in Lamb's district in 2014 and again in 2016.Lamb aggressively campaigned on local issues, and kept the national party at arm's length. After outside Republican groups spent millions trying to define him as a Pelosi puppet, Lamb released a TV ad in which he said, ""My opponent wants you to believe the biggest issue in this campaign is Nancy Pelosi. It's all a big lie. I've already said on the front page of the newspaper that I don't support Nancy Pelosi.""Lamb also did something that Democrats from former President Barack Obama on down have blasted Hillary Clinton for not doing more of in 2016: actually campaigning in the more conservative stretches of his district.""You've got to show up and talk to people,"" said Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, a Democrat who campaigned alongside Lamb throughout the special election. ""Conor's been to every fish fry, every VFW, every American Legion, senior center, doors.""While Lamb may not have won those parts of the district, that may have meant he lost by fewer votes — crucial in a race as close as his.The unique aspects of the 18th Congressional District and Lamb's campaign allowed him to take liberal votes for granted in a way that wouldn't work in a competitive Democratic primary, as House Speaker Paul Ryan noted Wednesday. He also did and said things that would likely alienate Democratic activists in a more liberal district.The question of ""ideological purity"" Centrists are not faring quite so well in areas that are safer bets for Democrats. It is in these districts that the internal tensions will be on the ballot in primary races over the coming months.The first test comes this Tuesday when voters on the Southwest Side of Chicago will decide between a long-serving conservative Democrat Dan Lipinski and his progressive challenger, Marie Newman.Lipinski has represented the Southwest Side of Chicago and its southwestern suburbs since 2005 — a seat he won when his father retired after a dozen years in Congress.""When it really comes down to it, people vote for who they trust,"" Lipinski said in an interview during  a campaign stop in his district.He is also one of the last centrist Democrats in Congress. Lipinski is anti-abortion rights, he voted against the Affordable Care Act and he voted with President Trump on some immigration bills — a record Newman says is increasingly out of step with the district.""People say, 'Oh, did the district change, why such a change now?' "" Newman said in a recent interview. ""No. The district has been this way for a long time.""She has already persuaded two of Lipinski's fellow House Democrats from Illinois to support her, including Rep. Jan Schakowsky.""This is not some sort of a national effort to have ideological purity,"" Schakowsky said. ""It's about giving this district a real choice.""In interviews with nearly a dozen Democrats, most said they are glad to have a real debate on issues in a district that has been virtually unchallenged for decades, including those who support Lipinski.""We have not had a choice, a real choice, in at least 14 years,"" said Newman supporter Mary Anne Quinlian. ""Not having a choice makes everyone feel limited. That isn't healthy.""But Lipinski says progressive pressure may drive centrists like him away from the Democrats for good.""I have seen the Democratic Party, unfortunately, push pro-life voters out of the party,"" Lipinski said. ""I have people come up to me and say, 'I used to be a Democrat and because of the life issue, I can't be a Democrat anymore.' ""Juggling the movementsDemocrats are carefully monitoring how these tensions are playing out with two of their most critical constituent groups — women and African-American voters.Emily Cain, the executive director of the abortion-rights supporter group Emily's List, said they have seen a huge surge of women running for office and she expects they will turn out in droves on Election Day. It isn't a moment she said; it is a sea change.""We have already launched more than 60 women in campaigns for Congress across the country,"" Cain said. ""There's another 60 or 100 behind them getting ready to run in 2020 or 2022.""Andra Gillespie, a political science professor at Emory University, said Democrats must also be careful not to ignore African-Americans when they're building the big tent.Gillespie said Democrats tend to assume African-Americans are in their camp and often don't think to directly address issues that speak to those voters. That is a mistake, she said, because African-American women in particular were key to Democrat Doug Jones winning a Senate seat in a special election in Alabama last year. But turnout among black voters dropped off in 2016 compared with Obama-era elections.""There is a tendency to whitewash and paper over issues of concern to African-Americans,"" Gillespie said in an interview. ""It's not just a 2018 problem. This has been a concern that's been articulated for decades at this point."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/17/594562355/source-fired-deputy-fbi-director-took-memos-notes-about-interactions-with-trump","Updated at 10:25 p.m. ETBefore Washington, D.C., had fully processed the late-night firing of Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who was let go by Attorney General Jeff Sessions less than 48 hours before his planned retirement after more than two decades of service to the bureau, the saga took several new, head-spinning turns Saturday.McCabe had taken notes and memos about his interactions with President Trump, similar to those prepared by his former boss and colleague James Comey, a source familiar with the issue told NPR. The source also said the McCabe documents corroborate Comey's account — which could play a key role in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's inquiry into obstruction of justice.The McCabe memos are in the possession of Mueller's team of investigators, according to CNN and Axios. And McCabe already sat for an interview with Mueller's team, Axios also reported.A personal lawyer for the president pointed to McCabe's ouster to argue that it was time for the Justice Department to end the special counsel investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race and of any ties between Russians and the Trump campaign.The attorney's remarks — though not intended to speak for the president — set off yet another round of concern among congressional Democrats about the status of the special counsel investigation and possible ways to protect it — and its leader, former FBI Director Mueller — from being terminated by the White House or the Justice Department.By Saturday evening, the president would echo his personal attorney, writing on Twitter ""The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier ....""And, Saturday afternoon McCabe's onetime boss, Comey, sparred directly on Twitter with the president, who fired the FBI director in May of last year. Comey, on the verge of releasing a book, told Trump that soon the American people ""can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.""Sessions announced late Friday that he had terminated McCabe's employment with the FBI ""effective immediately.""The attorney general pointed to internal recommendations from the Justice Department's inspector general and the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility that found ""McCabe had made an unauthorized disclosure to the news media and lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions,"" Sessions said in a statement announcing the firing.""The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability. As the OPR proposal stated, 'all FBI employees know that lacking candor under oath results in dismissal and that our integrity is our brand,' "" Sessions also said.But McCabe said his firing was politically motivated. ""I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,"" McCabe said in his own late-night statement Friday. The former FBI official said he had been targeted because he can ""corroborate former Director Comey's accounts of his discussions with the President.""McCabe's attorney said in his own statement that the White House has attacked McCabe since last year with the result of putting ""inappropriate pressure"" on Sessions to oust McCabe. ""This intervention by the White House in the DOJ disciplinary process is unprecedented, deeply unfair, and dangerous,"" attorney Michael Bromwich said.Bromwich also argued that the process by which the termination decision had been made was unfair and had been rushed, limiting the time that he and McCabe had to access, review and analyze the relevant evidence in order to prepare a response.The ""concerted effort to accelerate the process in order to beat the ticking clock of [McCabe's] scheduled retirement violates any sense of decency and basic principles of fairness,"" Bromwich said. (Sessions, for his part, said the internal investigation of McCabe had been ""extensive and fair"" and undertaken ""according to Department of Justice Procedure."")The McCabe firing added yet more fuel to the Russia imbroglio, an at least year-long conflagration that never wants for oxygen in Washington, D.C.""This will be known as the Friday night slaughter,"" presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said on CNN soon after news of the ouster broke. Brinkley was referencing President Richard M. Nixon's infamous ""Saturday Night Massacre"" of several senior Justice Department officials during the Watergate scandal.A personal lawyer for Trump seized on the firing and suggested it should provide motivation for the Justice Department to end the Mueller investigation altogether.Saying he was speaking for himself and not for Trump, attorney John Dowd said in a statement emailed to NPR that ""I pray that [Deputy Attorney General Rod] Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier.""""Just end it on the merits in light of recent revelations,"" Dowd explained, apparently alluding to the internal investigation that had ended McCabe's FBI career just before he planned to retire.The top Democrat in the Senate said Dowd's view reflected the inclination of the president and his legal team to undermine the special counsel rather than to cooperate with Mueller's investigation.""The president, the administration, and his legal team must not take any steps to curtail, interfere with, or end the special counsel's investigation or there will be severe consequences from both Democrats and Republicans,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement Saturday.The top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee saw Dowd's remarks as a call to action for his colleagues. ""Every member of Congress, Republican and Democrat, needs to speak up in defense of the Special Counsel. Now,"" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., posted on Twitter.Despite the pushback from leading Democrats in the Senate, Trump himself said Saturday night that the Mueller investigation should never have begun. ""...[t]here was no collusion and there was no crime"" Trump tweeted, adding that the Russia inquiry was a ""WITCH HUNT!""Hearing the echo Dowd's comments earlier in the in the day in Trump's evening tweet, New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman observed: ""Only two real options on Dowd's initial comment this AM - Trump approved it and was happy with it, or Trump wanted him to go further, was unhappy he didn't, and is doing so himself now.""Alongside the response to Dowd, lawmakers, partisans, political observers and journalists responded to the firing throughout the day — with Trump leaving no doubt how he felt.The occasion of McCabe's firing was ""a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy,"" the president said in an early morning tweet. Trump also used the online posting to take a swipe at Comey, calling him ""sanctimonious"" and suggesting Comey ""knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!""A former director of the CIA under President Barack Obama slammed Trump after the president praised McCabe's ouster. ""[Y]ou will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,"" John Brennan posted on Twitter. ""You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.""""Gloat now, but you will be fired soon,"" Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., a member of both the House intelligence committee and the House Judiciary Committee, told Trump. ""There's a storm gathering, Mr. President, and it's going to wipe out you and your corrupt organization all the way down to the studs.""Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on Twitter that the firing was an attempt to undermine McCabe as a witness in the special counsel investigation and was ""added evidence of obstruction of justice.""And Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a member of both the Senate intelligence committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee said the attorney general ""needs to testify immediately before the Judiciary Committee"" about McCabe's firing. ""He must explain the DOJ's process and whether this is an attempt to target, punish or silence those investigating Russia and the Trump campaign.""But Republican lawmakers said Saturday that McCabe's termination was justified.""I applaud Attorney General Jeff Sessions for taking action and firing former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe prior to his scheduled retirement,"" Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said in a statement. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee added, ""More must be done to root out the problems at the FBI. I remain extremely troubled by the decisions made by the Bureau during the 2016 presidential election and the role senior FBI officials played in these questionable decisions and irregularities.""And Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., another member of the House Judiciary Committee, said McCabe's firing was ""a rare example of someone being held accountable in Washington.""As is his habit, the president took to Twitter on Saturday afternoon to once again deny that his campaign had colluded with Russia, citing a recently announced conclusion by the House intelligence committee. In a seeming reference to McCabe's termination, the president added that ""As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State.""Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the House intelligence committee's top Democrat, quickly pointed out that the conclusion there had been no collusion was confined to the committee's Republicans — who, Schiff told Trump, were ""more interested in protecting you than learning the truth.""In another tweet Saturday afternoon, the president again took on the former FBI deputy director. ""McCabe was caught, called out and fired,"" Trump said, adding, ""How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!""Comey responded within minutes: ""Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.""But Saturday may have included a bright side for McCabe.In an effort to help McCabe complete the amount of employment necessary to qualify for his pension, Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., offered McCabe a job. ""My offer of employment to Mr. McCabe is a legitimate offer to work on election security,"" Pocan said in a press release.The Democratic lawmaker added: ""Finally, I'd like to thank Mr. McCabe for his years of service to the FBI and our country. He deserves the full retirement that he has been promised, not to have it taken away as a result of the President's political games.""NPR Justice correspondent Ryan Lucas contributed to this report."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/17/594336602/the-russia-investigations-what-does-devin-nunes-know","This week in the Russia investigations: Republicans on the House intelligence committee give President Trump a clean bill of health; Democrats say not so fast. It's a dispute over the basic nature of the Russia imbroglio. What does Nunes know?The chairman of the House intelligence committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., enjoys access not only to a huge breadth of information from America's spy agencies but also to some of their deepest secrets. He doesn't need to rely on press reports.At the same time, he is an ally of President Trump, a supporter of House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. — to whom he owes his chairmanship — and a politician with strong conservative views.So when Nunes and his House intelligence committee concluded this week that there was ""no evidence of collusion, coordination or conspiracy"" between the Trump campaign and the Russian attack on the 2016 presidential election, which Nunes was speaking: the intelligence insider or the party loyalist?The chairman is in a position to know what the U.S. intelligence community knows about the Russia matter, beyond tittle-tattle in the newspapers and into the secret evidence including signals intelligence and the reports from human sources.And it would be political malpractice for him not to continue advocating for his own president in the way he has from the very earliest phase of the House committee's investigation.So it's telling that, in this context, Nunes considers this moment opportune.There probably is no certified letter from Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin that says, ""Dear sir — In exchange for your help in the election, I vow to govern as president in ways that benefit you"" — and who knows whether there is any smoking-gun-type evidence.Well, Nunes is among those who might know. Very little of the rest of the evidence in the Russia case is clear-cut.There may never be an independent account, for example, of what took place in the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting at which Donald Trump Jr. hosted a delegation of Russians after an email offer that described Moscow's desire to support the Trump campaign. Maybe there'll never be a recording or a trustworthy transcript that sheds any light on whether other Trump campaign aides might have conspired when they had their contacts with Russians in 2016.What does it all add up to? In clearing Trump, Nunes and the House intelligence committee are not only stating there is no such evidence today, but also that there never will be.Democrats have alternatively fumed about this conclusion and mocked it, including frequent Trump critic Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif.They say Nunes and the committee's GOP majority won't even ask the questions — of witnesses or by way of documents and other materials — that might result in the answers they don't want to hear.There have been some indications that members of the House intelligence committee might have a little gambler's remorse about their play: A few broke from another of Nunes' conclusions, that the U.S. intelligence community was wrong in assessing that Putin's active measures were aimed at supporting Trump.Trying to sell that message and the big one exonerating the president might have been a bridge too far, as some members told Politico's Kyle Cheney.But the big one is the most important and it came through — and will again whenever the committee's full report appears publicly. The House intelligence committee also has put itself in a position to be able to criticize the other investigations of Russian election interference that continue, both on the Senate side and by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller.""We looked at this, found nothing, and completed our work,"" the House committee's GOP majority can say. ""Anyone else who continues to probe Russia must be doing so out of partisan animus and needs to give up this scurrilous fishing expedition.""That is a gamble, however. If the House committee has decided it will not learn anything new that changes the state of play, what if the Senate or Mueller's office does?The bottom line: Nunes and Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, and their colleagues get all this — which is why their decision and announcement this week are so significant. They understand the political implications for them and Republicans of getting it wrong. Still they proceeded, and that confidence could say a lot about the Russia imbroglio: Maybe this is all there is to it.The known universeIf the Republican view is correct and that all there is to be known about the Russia case is already known, that's good news for them and great news for Trump, although it doesn't necessarily nullify every potential danger.Some Democrats, for example, argue that what is known already about contacts before and after Election Day 2016 amount to prima-facie evidence of conspiracy. Mueller could make out charges based on that interpretation.There is also a school of thought that there is a case hiding in plain sight against Trump and aides involving campaign finance law, which bars Americans from accepting ""anything of value"" from foreigners in an election.Conaway, for his part, says the worst that can be said about Trump campaign advisers is that they were guilty of ""bad judgment."" With the books closed on the House Russia investigation, the way is clear for him and his colleagues to go on offense.That means Conaway and his Republican colleagues have set the table to reject any potential new Mueller prosecutions as baseless or political. In the Senate, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, renewed along with his compatriots the call for a second special counsel to investigate the circumstances that led to Mueller's appointment.None of this means that if the facts change in the Russia case, either with indictments against more Russians or more Americans, the political state of play won't change again.It does suggest, though, that whatever Nunes has seen within the classified world it made him confident enough to bet on shifting his Russia train onto a siding."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/17/594550593/facebook-suspends-political-data-firm-used-in-trump-campaign","Facebook has suspended the data analytics firm that the Trump campaign relied on during the 2016 election, saying the firm improperly received user data and then may have failed to get rid of it.On Friday, the social media giant announced that Cambridge Analytica; parent company Strategic Communication Laboratories; Christopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica; and U.K.-based professor Aleksandr Kogan were all barred from Facebook pending an investigation.Kogan of the University of Cambridge came up with an app billed on Facebook as a personality predictor ""used by psychologists."" About 270,000 people downloaded ""thisisyourdigitallife,"" according to Facebook, and in doing so gave away their data; some — depending on security settings — even gave away information about their Facebook friends.Although users may not have realized it, the mining of their personal information was aboveboard; just by downloading the app they had — knowingly or not — consented to giving it away.But they did not consent to Kogan giving it away, Facebook says. And when Kogan passed on their data to Cambridge Analytica, he violated platform policies against sharing information with a third party.Facebook says it learned about what happened in 2015 and removed the app, then demanded Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and SCL destroy the data. Facebook says it was assured by each entity the data was gone.Now Facebook says it recently learned those assurances may have been false.""Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted,"" Facebook Vice President and Deputy General Counsel Paul Grewal said in a statement Friday. ""We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims.""Cambridge Analytica denies wrongdoing.In its own statement, it concedes it contracted with and received data from Global Science Research, a company led by Kogan, but says that when it learned that the user information was not obtained in line with Facebook's terms of service, it deleted all of it.Cambridge Analytica says it is committed to receiving information in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act ""and to seek the informed consent of each respondent.""To what extent the Trump campaign and Cambridge Analytica were intertwined remains murky.Billionaire Republican donor Robert Mercer, who donated to the Trump campaign, backs Cambridge Analytica, having invested millions of dollars in the company. And Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon sat on its board, even naming the company, according The New York Times.According to the newspaper, ""the firm was effectively a shell"" based in the U.K. and run by foreigners whose contracts with American campaigns — including that of presidential hopeful Ted Cruz — possibly violated Federal Election Commission rules. (The Times interviewed Wylie, who has since left the company and runs another firm.)The Trump campaign says it briefly used Cambridge Analytica for TV ads and paid some of its data employees, according to The Associated Press.But congressional investigators have questioned CEO Alexander Nix about the company's role in the campaign.Nix said last fall that the firm reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in the runup to the election to request emails connected to the Hillary Clinton campaign. WikiLeaks said no. It was around the same time that Cambridge began working for the Trump campaign, reports The Wall Street Journal.The Journal also reports that the firm has become ensnared in Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.The company says it uses data analytics and behavioral psychology to boost the clients' campaigns. Nix has denied to the U.K. Parliament that the company gets its data from Facebook.And yet as the firm sought to build ""psychographic profiles"" to help discern whom Internet users are and how political messaging might be tailored to them, it turned to Kogan, the Cambridge University psychology professor. The Times says Kogan created the app using a technique developed at the school's Psychometrics Centre, which is designed to map personality traits based Facebook likes. Kogan then put the app on Facebook under the false pretense of using it for academic purposes.All told, the Times says Kogan handed over more than 50 million profiles to Cambridge Analytica, including information from app users' friends — who had never consented to forgoing their data. Around 30 million of those profiles contained enough information to build psychographic profiles, the newspaper says.The firm said in its statement, ""No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.""Facebook says it will take legal action if it finds something unlawful occurred."

I’ve never lived anywhere else,” Nixon said in a campaign video. “New York is where I was raised and where I’m raising my kids. I’m a proud public school graduate and a prouder public school parent.”“I love New York. I’ve never wanted to live anywhere else, but something has to change,” Nixon said, adding that the government should fix the state’s problems with healthcare, mass incarceration and the subway system.Nixon, 51, is no stranger to politics. She’s often butted heads with Cuomo over issues pertaining to public education. She’s advocated for an increase in funding for public schools, breast cancer awareness and gay rights, among other things. She’s protested President Trump and campaigned for former President Barack Obama.Here’s a look at Nixon’s political advocacy and some of the issues she’s passionate about.Nixon was once arrested during a protest at City Hall aimed at increasing funding to public schools.“We marched on up, sat down and blocked the entrance,” she told The New York Times. “The police very politely asked us to move, and we declined. They pulled up the police van and put us in.”The Tony Award winner is also a spokeswoman for the Alliance for Quality Education, a New York-based organization that advocates for “high quality academic opportunities.”“She’s been a very clear advocate, not just in a sort of self-interested, ‘I’m just trying to take care of my kids’ [way], but more from the standpoint of every kid deserves a great opportunity,” he said.In an op-ed for The Journal News, a New York newspaper, Nixon criticized the Trump administration’s support for charter schools and implored New York to put more resources into public schools.“Cynthia uses her talent and public platform to speak out for equality in this country and around the globe, and in the process, she is changing countless hearts and minds,” Griffin said in a statement.A year before she was awarded the honor, Nixon protested Trump’s immigration ban at a rally held outside New York City’s Stonewall Inn, an important historical site for gay rights. She criticized Vice President Mike Pence, calling him the “poster boy for anti-LGBT rhetoric, legislation and conversion therapy.”“As LGBT people, we know how important coming out is, but I would argue that our coming out has never been more important than it is right now,” Nixon said.Nixon has been married to activist Marinoni since 2012. The pair lobbied to legalize gay marriage in Washington, where Marinoni is from.Nixon kept her own diagnosis quiet while she received treatment, telling ABC News she didn’t want paparazzi at the hospital. After hearing the news from her doctor, she said she “felt scared” and didn’t “want this to be happening.”The cancer was found early, in 2006, and Nixon was able to beat it. She also had some prior experience with breast cancer; her mother successfully battled it when Nixon was a child, according to ABC News.To treat it, Nixon had a lumpectomy and underwent more than six weeks of radiation, Fox News previously reported.“I am convinced that abortion rights are human rights not only because of compassion for my mother but also because I am a mother of three,” Nixon wrote in an op-ed for Time, detailing her mother’s own abortion. “Many of us who made the decision to become parents have experienced a unique desire for parenthood. But that in no way mutes our desire for abortion to be safe, legal and available.”A post shared by  Cynthia Nixon (@cynthiaenixon) on Jan 20, 2018 at 10:39am PSTNixon is a keynote speaker at Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas’ awards luncheon in Dallas later this month. And she’s also participated in the Women’s March, a nationwide women-led rally that advocates for women's rights, but also hot button issues such as immigration reform and LGBTQ rightsAccording to a New York Times profile, Nixon sent Baldwin an email, encouraging him to publicly pick de Blasio over Christine Quinn, then the speaker of the City Council.Baldwin responded to Nixon’s email, ensuring her that he would support de Blasio and apologizing for “lamely” assuming that she was supporting Quinn as both women are lesbians, according to The Times.She would also get other celebrities on board with de Blasio – including fellow “Sex and the City” star Sarah Jessica Parker – and organized a fundraiser for him.She is listed as one of de Blasio’s advisors. And for her own campaign, she's already assembled a staff that includes veteran operatives who have worked for de Blasio, according to NY1."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/19/trump-vs-clinton-feud-continues-even-after-election.html","It’s been nearly 500 days since the presidential election, but even still, President Trump and Hillary Clinton haven’t stopped their bickering.Once friends — Clinton was even a guest at Trump’s third wedding in 2005 — the two New Yorkers haven’t left their squabbling behind in what was a volatile campaign season.Here’s a look at the jabs Clinton and Trump have taken at one another since Nov. 8, 2016.“During an interview last week with an Indian news publication, I was asked about 2016, and whether Trump is the ‘virus’ or a ‘symptom’ of something deeper going on in American society. Like most Americans, people overseas remain shocked and dismayed at what they are witnessing daily,” Clinton said.“I know this because even I spent parts of my life wondering if I could achieve the same as male leaders, and a lot of that insecurity stemmed from my gender and how society views women,” she said. “When I was serving in various roles in public life, I was always more popular when I was working for or defending a man then when I was out there on my own. That’s the point I was making, in an effort to explain to an audience some of the many dynamics that have gone into these tumultuous last few years.”“As I said throughout the campaign, Trump’s message was dark and backwards looking,” she wrote. “I don’t need to list the reasons, but the foundation of his message, ‘Make America Great AGAIN’ suggests that to be great we have to go back to something we are no longer. I never accepted that and never will.”She accused Trump of having “quite an affinity for dictators” and said he “really likes their authoritarian posturing and behavior.”And as for her election loss more than a year ago, Clinton said the Democratic Party does not “do well with white men” or “married, white women.”She added that Trump ran a “backwards” campaign that appealed to misogynists and racists. His campaign slogan – “Make America Great Again” – was “looking backwards,"" she added.She claimed Trump’s message to voters was: “You know, you didn't like black people getting rights, you don't like women, you know, getting jobs. You don't want, you know, to see that Indian American succeeding more than you are.”""I won the places that represent two-thirds of America's gross domestic product,” Clinton continued. “So I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward.”“Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November?” Trump said. “Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win.”“Unprecedented. Bigger than Watergate! Plus, Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling,” he continued.Rogers recently told the Senate Armed Services Committee that “we’re probably not doing enough” to deter Russians from interfering in future elections, including the 2018 midterms.“Our intelligence professionals are imploring Trump to act. Will he continue to ignore & surrender, or protect our country?” Clinton asked.His remark led the crowd to begin chants of “lock her up,” a common refrain at Trump campaign rallies.“The anniversary of the devastating earthquake 8 years ago is a day to remember the tragedy, honor the resilient people of Haiti, & affirm America’s commitment to helping our neighbors. Instead, we‘re subjected to Trump’s ignorant, racist views of anyone who doesn’t look like him.”A day prior, Clinton retweeted conservative commentator Bill Kristol.“Two weeks ago a 26-year old soldier raced repeatedly into a burning Bronx apartment building, saving four people before he died in the flames. His name was Pvt. Emmanuel Mensah and he immigrated from Ghana, a country Donald Trump apparently thinks produces very subpar immigrants,” Kristol tweeted. “Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians? Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers? Where are Crooked Hillary Emails? What a mess!”Goodwin said in his column, as Trump quoted, that the “mere thought of Clinton in the White House, doubling down on Barack Obama’s failed policies, washes away any doubts that America made the right choice.” “Now that Russian collusion, after one year of intense study, has proven to be a total hoax on the American public, the Democrats and their lapdogs, the Fake News Mainstream Media, are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence,” Trump said.“Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart. Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames. I went from VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star to President of the United States (on my first try),” Trump continued. “I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius … and a very stable genius at that!”“Well, now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad!”“If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day,” Trump said in a morning tweet. “Now they have a great future – and just beginning!”She also said Trump “doesn’t just like Putin, he wants to be like Putin.” ""So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed, while Crooked Hillary Clinton, on that now famous FBI holiday 'interrogation' with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times … and nothing happens to her? Rigged system, or just a double standard?"" Trump tweeted.Clinton, too, took digs at Trump while she was at a Teen Vogue summit in California.Speaking to “Black-ish” star Yara Shahidi, Clinton addressed the presidential debate when Trump stood closely behind her as she moved around the stage, according to the Hollywood Reporter.“All of that stuff he did didn’t end up hurting him that much because men are given a much broader range of emotions to demonstrate their authentic feelings,” Clinton said.“Crooked Hillary Clinton is the worst (and biggest) loser of all time. She just can’t stop, which is so good for the Republican Party,” the president tweeted. “Hillary, get on with your life and give it another try in three years!”“Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” Trump said on Twitter. “New Donna B book says she paid for and stole the Dem Primary. What about the deleted E-mails, Uranium, Podesta, the Server, plus, plus…”“People are angry. At some point the Justice Department, and the FBI, must do what is right and proper. The American public deserves it!”“The real story of Collusion is in Donna B’s new book. Crooked Hillary bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary from Crazy Bernie!”Trump also noted that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. – who he referred to as “Pocahontas” – answered in the affirmative when asked by CNN if she believed the DNC was rigged in favor of Clinton. “Donna Brazile just stated the DNC RIGGED the system to illegally steal the Primary from Bernie Sanders. Bought and paid for by Crooked H,” Trump said. “This is real collusion and dishonesty. Major violation of Campaign Finance Laws and Money Laundering – where is our Justice Department?”Later, in an interview with Fox News’ “The Ingraham Angle,” Trump continued to criticize the DNC’s apparent involvement with Clinton.“Uranium deal to Russia, with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge, is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow!” Trump tweeted.“As it turned out, James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her,” Trump said.He also implied that the letter Comey wrote “exonerating Crooked Hillary Clinton” was “obviously a fix.” ""I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020,"" Trump tweeted. ""My answer was: 'I hope so!'""Trump later reiterated his desire for Clinton to run during a press briefing in the Rose Garden. He also criticized her for sticking up for professional athletes who have chosen to kneel during the national anthem in a sign of protest. “The really sad part of the campaign was how this horrific tape, what he said about women in the past, what he said about women during the campaign, was discounted by a lot of voters,” Clinton told the BBC.Clinton was most likely referring to the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape from 2005 that caught Trump bragging that he could “do anything” to a woman because of his status. He also said he could grab “them by the p----.”Trump later apologized for his comments and chalked them up to “locker room talk.”“I am very happy that you used the word 'deplorable,'” Trump said. “I was very interested in that word.”In Clinton’s new memoir about the presidential election, she blamed her use of the word “deplorables” to describe Trump’s supporters, in part, for her loss. “Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing [sic]) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!” Trump said.“The ‘deplorables’ came back to haunt Hillary. They expressed their feelings loud and clear,” he continued in another tweet. “She spent big money but, in the end, had no game!”While Clinton apologized for calling Trump supporters “deplorable” at the time, she defended her use of the word in an interview with CBS News.“I thought Trump was behaving in a deplorable manner. I thought a lot of his appeals to voters were deplorable. I thought his behavior, as we saw on the ‘Access Hollywood’ tape was deplorable. And there were a large number of people who didn’t care. It did not matter to them,” Clinton said.As the Daily Caller noted, the “deplorable” comment came almost a full month before the “Access Hollywood” tape was released. He told the crowd that the reason he won Michigan was because he “worked hard there” unlike Clinton.“You know, my opponent didn’t work hard there because she was told … she was going to win Michigan,” Trump said.Trump also repeated his questions about the investigation into possible collusion between the Russian government and his campaign during the presidential election continues.“So why aren’t the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered [Attorney General Jeff Sessions], looking into Crooked Hillarys [sic] crimes & Russia relations?” Trump tweeted. In his tweet, Trump referenced the emails deleted from Clinton’s private server she used during her tenure as secretary of state.In an additional tweet, Trump again compared his son’s publishing of emails pertaining to a meeting with a Russian lawyer to Clinton’s own handling of her email server.“Hillary Clinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33,000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?”Former CNN commentator and interim Democratic National Committee chairwoman Donna Brazile admitted in March 2017 to sharing debate questions with the Clinton campaign ahead of the primary town hall event.  “Why aren’t the same standards placed on the Democrats,” Trump tweeted. “Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!”In a tweet, Trump alleged that if Clinton would have let daughter Chelsea Clinton sit in for her, the media would have heralded the decision.“If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her mother, as her mother gave our country away, the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!”Chelsea Clinton got in on the feud and responded on social media.“Good morning Mr. President. It would never have occurred to my mother or my father to ask me. Were you giving our country away? Hoping not,” she said.“Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself, refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & the DNC,” Trump tweeted.Clinton fired back less than an hour later, mocking Trump for an erroneous but viral tweet he sent earlier in the day.“People in covfefe houses shouldn’t throw covfefe,” she said.“When people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society,” Clinton said. “That is not hyperbole; it is what authoritarian regimes throughout history have done … They attempt to control reality.”The budget “shows an unimaginable level of cruelty and lack of imagination and disdain for the struggles of millions of Americans, including millions of children,” she said. “None of us can remain silent in the face of these attacks.”""It hurts the well-being of children,"" Clinton continued. ""It's time to send a resounding message that we will not stand for this attack on the most vulnerable among us.""""If [Trump] wants to tweet about me I'm happy to be the diversion because we've got lots of other things to worry about. And he should worry less about the election, and my winning the popular vote, than doing some other things that would be important to the country,"" Clinton said at an event in New York City.“He should worry less about the election and me winning the popular vote and more about other things,” the former secretary of state said.“Remember, I did win more than 3 million votes than my opponent,” Clinton added.She also said that she’s now a “private citizen” and “part of the resistance.”“New polls out today are very good considering that much of the media is FAKE and almost always negative,” Trump tweeted. “Would still beat Hillary in popular vote.”Trump then cited an ABC News/Washington Post poll that he said showed “almost all stand by their vote” for Trump.Of Trump’s policies, Clinton encouraged the women gathered to “resist, insist, persist, enlist.”“These are bad policies that will hurt people and take our country in the wrong direction,” she said.“Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: ‘In my opinion, it is humiliating. One must be able to lose with dignity.’ So true!” Trump tweeted.“Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult [and] sophisticated than the popular vote,” Trump said. “Hillary focused on the wrong states!”“In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” Trump, then the president-elect, tweeted.Fox News’ Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

His Revised Standard Version (RSV) Bible was then used for the inauguration ceremony on top of the same book President Abraham Lincoln used in 1861.“My mother gave me this Bible, this very Bible, many years ago,” Trump said in a campaign video from Trump Tower. “In fact it’s her writing right here. She wrote the name and my address, and it’s just very special to me.”""We are honored to add this piece of our nation's history to our growing exhibit of presidential Bibles,"" Museum of the Bible President Cary Summers said in a statement. ""It is our hope that guests will be able to learn not only about each president's unique Bible, but also about the influence this book has had on government and elected officials around the world.""The Museum of the Bible placed the Trump Bible on display in the “Bible in the World” exhibit on the second floor, alongside the Bibles of presidents Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, George H.W. Bush, and George W.

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/19/how-white-house-is-tackling-opioid-epidemic.html","It’s important that the full weight of the federal government – with each Cabinet department determining their role in the crisis – is involved in tackling the epidemic, said Tom Coderre, a former official with the Obama administration’s Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 115 Americans die daily from opioid-involved deaths. Opioids, including prescriptions and heroin, killed 42,000 people in the U.S. in 2016 – the highest on record.Trump will officially unveil his plan during a speech in New Hampshire on March 19. Here's what his proposal entails. “The only way to solve the drug problem is through toughness,” the president said.At a meeting at the White House on opioids, Trump said the U.S. needs to “be very strong on penalties.”“Some countries have a very, very tough penalty — the ultimate penalty. And, by the way, they have much less of a drug problem than we do,” Trump said.The White House announced on March 18 that it intends to seek the death penalty for certain drug traffickers ""where appropriate under the law.""The Justice Department said the federal death penalty is already available for several limited drug-related offenses, including violations of the “drug kingpin” provisions of federal law.Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina have already announced plans to introduce legislation “aimed at fighting [the] opioid epidemic,” according to a press release. Their bill would include lowering the amount of fentanyl needed to invoke mandatory minimum sentences in certain distribution cases.“It’s past time the punishment matched the crime when it comes to opioid distribution and trafficking,” Cotton said in a statement.Graham added, “Increasing these mandatory minimums is well-justified.”With the public health emergency declaration, officials are able to more easily deploy state and federal workers, secure grants for the unemployed and shift funding from certain programs – such as HIV or AIDs programs – to provide substance abuse treatment for certain individuals.Jessica Hulsey Nickel, president and CEO of the Addiction Policy Forum, praised the declaration in a statement to Fox News.“Prioritizing this national crisis will bring much needed resources to communities, improve access to services and facilitate better coordination among government agencies. In particular, I am heartened by the decision to bring all federal government agencies to the table to play a unique role,” Nickel said.Last year, in asking Trump to declare a national emergency, a White House commission on opioid abuse said such a declaration “would also awaken every American to this simple fact: if this scourge has not found you or your family yet, without bold action by everyone, it soon will.”Gary Mendell, founder and CEO of the nonprofit Shatterproof, agreed, saying that the crisis needs more “attention and awareness.”“People are talking about this more and more, but if the president were to declare this a national emergency, it creates recognition around the country and awareness around the country that this epidemic needs right now,” he said.HHS has issued public health emergency declarations in the wake of natural disasters as well as the spread of diseases.The agency issued its first declaration for the Zika virus in Puerto Rico in August 2016. It was last renewed in April 2017.Public health emergencies were also declared in New York following Hurricane Sandy in November 2012 and in Missouri following a series of storms and tornadoes in May 2011. “It took too long to get to where we are today. I think there was thought they could do this without declaring a national emergency,” Coderre said of the declaration. “But people are dying.”The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/19/sen-tom-cotton-why-support-pompeo-at-state-haspel-at-cia.html","My colleague, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, took to this space on Thursday to announce he would oppose both President Trump’s nominations of Mike Pompeo as secretary of state and Gina Haspel as director of the CIA. His arguments against them were deeply ill-informed, and because of the misperceptions they’ve spread, they deserve a fundamental reply.First, Senator Paul trained his sights on Ms. Haspel, whom he said “presided over practices that epitomized the abuse” of government power. Senator Paul based his argument on a single piece of evidence: a quote in a book of a CIA operative who crassly hounded a detainee while interrogating him. He was referring to her supposed tenure as head of a CIA “black site” in Thailand, which used enhanced interrogation techniques to elicit information from detainees, including Al Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah. On a separate occasion, Senator Paul even went so far as to call Ms. Haspel the “head cheerleader for waterboarding.”All of which is false. Citing a ProPublica article on the book, Senator Paul alleged the quote belonged to Ms. Haspel, but the author of the book himself later debunked his claim. It was an entirely different CIA operative. As a result, both ProPublica and Senator Paul were forced to issue corrections.Next, Senator Paul questions Mike Pompeo’s judgment for his stalwart support of the FISA Section 702 program, which the intelligence community uses to monitor the electronic communications of terrorist suspects. Senator Paul flatly calls it a “spying” program and labels it “unconstitutional,” but again, he’s wrong on the facts. The Section 702 program can only be used to monitor the communications of foreign persons on foreign soil—not American citizens. And every time this program has come before a federal judge it has been upheld as constitutional. But more important than that, it has saved American lives. In 2009, the intelligence we gained from this program helped our national-security officials foil a plot to bomb the New York subway.Senator Paul considers it a count against Director Pompeo that he called for Edward Snowden to receive the death penalty. The way I see it, Edward Snowden was an egotistical serial liar and traitor whose unauthorized disclosures of classified information have jeopardized the safety of Americans and allies around the world. Snowden should be tried and sentenced for his despicable crimes, and it’s entirely reasonable to make the case that he deserves capital punishment for committing treason—as Bill Clinton’s CIA Director, James Woolsey, has argued.I have had the pleasure of working with both Director Pompeo and Ms. Haspel personally, and here’s what I know about them. Mike Pompeo has a deep understanding of world affairs, a clear-eyed view of the threats to our national security, and key relationships with world leaders, all of which make him an excellent choice to be our top diplomat. Gina Haspel, meanwhile, is a true professional with decades of experience at the agency. They are dedicated, hardworking patriots and would serve our country with distinction—because they have no illusions about the dangers our country faces.Senator Paul is right in saying no one should look to war “as a first resort—let alone eagerly cheerlead for its arrival.” But it’s not enough to simply confront war when it arrives—we must prepare for war in peacetime in order to prevent it. It was precisely the fact that Ronald Reagan rebuilt our military and modernized our nuclear arsenal in the 1980s that allowed him to negotiate with the Soviet Union. It was American strength that led to peace.Senator Paul may disagree with that, but Mike Pompeo and Gina Haspel do not, and that’s why I’ll be proud to support both of their nominations."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/19/joel-c-rosenberg-putin-just-won-rigged-election-and-trump-needs-to-tackle-threat-poses.html","Darkness is falling in Russia. Vladimir Putin didn’t simply secure re-election on Sunday, winning 77 percent of the vote in a rigged election. He has consolidated all power in his hands and emerged as a modern-day Czar. He has also set his country on a collision course with the West, one that could prove catastrophic.A close look at Putin’s record and rhetoric reveals a man consumed with re-creating a totalitarian state, expanding the country’s borders and rebuilding the glory of Mother Russia.Putin has crushed the nascent democracy that was emerging in post-Soviet Russia in the 1990s, and brooks no dissent. His critics – be they journalists, businessmen, politicians, or anyone else – disappear, or die.Meanwhile, Putin has crushed the nascent free market economy that was beginning to emerge after the collapse of the Soviet empire. Russia’s re-centralized economy is suffocating. Poverty is rampant. Deaths by alcoholism and drug overdoses are exploding. One in four Russian men die before age 55. And Russians aren’t having enough children to replace themselves. Why would they? They have no hope.In 1999, then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin appointed Putin as prime minister. Many Russians didn’t even know who he was. Only two percent supported Putin to replace Yeltsin as president. Yet in just a few short months, Putin’s approval rating skyrocketed to the mid-80s. When Yeltsin formally stepped down as president, Putin was easily elected to replace him.How did the Putin become so popular overnight? By invading Chechnya. He accused the Chechens of perpetrating a series of horrific apartment bombings (without any solid evidence, mind you). Then he proceeded to bomb Grozny, the Chechen capital, nearly out of existence. The Russian people concluded Putin was the strong man they needed to keep them safe.In time, Putin’s approval ratings dropped from the mid-80s to the mid-60s, and Putin was fit to be tied. He gave a major speech declaring that the collapse of the Soviet Union was “the greatest geopolitical disaster” of the 20th century. He complained that “tens of millions of our co-citizens and compatriots [find] themselves outside Russian territory.”Then, in the summer of 2008, Putin and his protégé, Dmitri Medvedev, ordered Russian forces to invade the Republic of Georgia. They proceeded to occupy 20 percent of Georgia, and Putin’s poll numbers skyrocketed to 88 percent.Fast-forward to 2011 and 2012. Russians were on the streets, protesting against government corruption and a weak economy. Putin’s numbers were deflating again, hitting a low of 61 percent.Suddenly, Putin ordered Russian forces to seize eastern and southern Ukraine. On March 18, 2014, Putin formally annexed Crimea into the Russian Federation. His approval ratings shot up to 83 percent.Next, Putin sent Russian forces into Syria. Together with Bashar al-Assad, Iran’s ayatollahs and the jihadists of Hezbollah, he helped slaughter thousands of people. Millions more have fled for their lives. Suddenly, Russia was the new superpower in the Middle East. Just in time for another Russian presidential election.Putin isn’t winning elections – even rigged ones – because he’s making day-to-day life better for the average Russian. To the extent people willingly vote for him, it’s because he appeals to the bloodlust deep in the Russian soul. Putin creates a crisis, sends Russian forces into battle, crushes his enemies, and declares victory, and the people have something to cheer.How Should Washington Respond?In the face of such a grave and growing threat, however, President Trump has been essentially radio silent about the most dangerous dictator on the planet. He only mentioned Russia once in his State of the Union address. He rarely if ever Tweets criticism of the Russian leader. Indeed, Mr. Trump is more critical of his own Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, than he is of Putin.Now that Putin has finished with his re-election charade, we must be prepared for the possibility that he will become even more aggressive -- kill more critics, possibly invade another country.Now is the time, therefore, for President Trump to impose far more — and far tougher — sanctions against Russian officials and oligarchs to punish them for their crimes and prevent new crimes. The moves he made last week were steps in the right direction, but not nearly enough.Follow the money of Putin’s inner circle. Freeze their assets. Make it difficult or even impossible for them to use or move their money from U.S. and European banks. Prevent these gangsters from having the freedom to travel into the U.S. and NATO countries. In short: hit the Russians where it really hurts, in their wallets. Mr. Trump must also speak out clearly and more firmly against Putin’s aggressions in interviews and tweets. He should deliver a major speech declaring that Putin poses a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States and our allies, explaining Putin is hungry for wealth, hungrier for power, hungrier still for territory. He needs to lay out a comprehensive strategy to counter Russia’s military, intelligence and cyber threats. And he needs to significantly beef up U.S. and NATO deterrent forces in the Baltic States, which currently are too lightly defended and thus vulnerable to Russian attack.Meanwhile, the president ought to host a meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May and other NATO leaders to discuss and implement additional unified strategies.Darkness is falling in Russia. A virulently anti-American Czar is sitting in the Kremlin, plotting his next moves. Only decisive American leadership, in concert with our allies, can stop him. And stop him we must."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/19/ousted-fbi-official-mccabe-offered-jobs-by-dem-lawmakers-so-can-get-full-pension.html","A growing number of Democratic lawmakers are offering temporary jobs to ousted FBI official Andrew McCabe in an attempt to help him secure a full government pension after Attorney General Jeff Sessions fired him just two days shy of his retirement.It’s not clear if the Democratic offers could even work or be accepted by McCabe. Asked by Fox News about the possibility, a source close to McCabe would only say the former FBI deputy director is “looking at all options.”The idea was first floated Friday by MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell after Sessions fired McCabe, who the attorney general said ""lacked candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions.""McCabe was fired just days before he would have been eligible for a lifetime pension, meaning those benefits could now be in jeopardy -- something Democrats are trying to prevent.Sessions said the DOJ’s inspector general determined McCabe was not truthful during his review of the Clinton email investigation and the FBI’s Office of Professional Responsibility recommended his firing.“To Andrew McCabe: If you need a federal job, call me on Monday,” Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., tweeted. “I am serious. We have to stand up to bullies like @realDonaldTrump & @jeffsessions.”Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton replied to NBC’s Mitchell and tweeted: “Would be happy to consider this. The Sixth District of MA would benefit from the wisdom and talent of such an experienced public servant.”Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin tweeted: “Andrew McCabe: I have the need to hire a Special Senior Staff Attorney to help me with my work on the House Judiciary Committee dealing with threats to the Constitution and the rule of law in America. You're perfect for the job. DM me.”Wisconsin Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan issued a press release on Saturday, saying he extended an offer to McCabe “so that he can reach the needed length of service” for his pension.""My offer of employment to Mr. McCabe is a legitimate offer to work on election security,” Pocan said. “Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of American democracy and both Republicans and Democrats should be concerned about election integrity.”The job offer idea has been mocked by Republicans.“Wonderful idea,” Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary under George W. Bush, sarcastically tweeted. “Every member of Congress should hire fired bureaucrats who lied to an inspector general in the course of a government investigation. Pensions before Honesty. Great slogan.”Despite the offers, it would be tricky for McCabe to make this work, federal employer lawyers said.Joanna Friedman, a partner at the Federal Practice Group in Washington who focuses on federal employment law, told Fox News McCabe would have to be hired into a law enforcement officer position to keep his eligibility. “I think it would be very difficult for a congressional member to hire him into the correct job series,” Friedman said. “I don’t really see how they have the authority or jurisdiction to put someone into a position like that.”But Friedman said there’s nothing to prevent a lawmaker in Congress from hiring McCabe just because Sessions fired him.“If someone wants to hire him, there’s nothing that stops it,” she said.Sessions’ decision to fire McCabe came as Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz is wrapping up a bureau oversight investigation of the Clinton email investigation.Horowitz determined that McCabe hadn't been forthcoming over questions about the FBI’s probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state. The inspector general’s finding sparked an FBI disciplinary process that recommended McCabe’s firing.On Friday, Sessions said he accepted that recommendation and was firing McCabe for making “an unauthorized disclosure to the news media” and lacking “candor − including under oath − on multiple occasions.”Fox News’ Jake Gibson and Brooke Singman contributed to this report."

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/19/former-trump-administration-officials-from-comey-to-tillerson.html","A growing number of people have left the Trump administration in just over a year – a group that includes FBI director James Comey, chief strategist Steve Bannon and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.Some, such as Comey and Tillerson, were fired by President Trump, while others resigned for a variety of reasons.Trump addressed the high turnover in the White House in a March tweet, denying that there is any ""chaos."" ""People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection),"" he said. Read on for a look at some of the staffers who have left since Trump took office.The dismissal was made on the recommendation of FBI disciplinary officials. A yet-to-be-released inspector general report allegedly concluded McCabe had authorized the release of information to the media and had not been forthcoming with the watchdog office as it examined the bureau's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.""The FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability,"" Sessions said in a statement after McCabe was fired. In a tweet, Trump said the firing was a “great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI.”The dismissal came after McCabe, a 20-year veteran of the FBI, was ""removed"" from his position as the No. 2 figure at the FBI and went on ""terminal leave"" in January, a source told Fox News at the time. He had repeatedly been criticized by Trump since 2016 when it was revealed that his wife, Dr. Jill McCabe, had accepted campaign contributions from the political action committee of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a close Clinton ally, during a failed state Senate run.Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil chief, served as the nation’s top diplomat since February 2017. Rumors of his departure had circulated for months, especially after he reportedly called Trump a “moron” in front of other Cabinet officials in July 2017.In a tweet, Trump thanked Tillerson for his service to the country. A senior White House official told Fox News that Trump made the decision to replace Tillerson ahead of a planned meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.Tillerson later told reporters that he is delegating his responsibilities to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan until his final day at the end of March.He was moved to Trump's 2020 campaign, where he will serve as a senior adviser for campaign operations, the Trump campaign said.""Gary has been my chief economic advisor and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again,"" Trump said in a statement. ""He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.”Cohn, who served as Trump’s chief economic adviser since the beginning of the administration, has reportedly been discussing with the president his transition out of the White House for several weeks. Cohn opposed Trump's planned tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum and tried to get the president to change course.White House officials told Fox News that Cohn's departure date is to be determined, but it's expected to be in a few weeks.Cohn drafted a resignation letter last year, following the president's response to the violence in Charlottesville, Va. Her resignation, which she said would take effect on May 5, comes amid strained relations between the two countries. She did not specify why she will be leaving her post but said on Twitter that she is “in search of other opportunities.”""I have come to the difficult decision that it is the right time to move on to new challenges and adventures,"" Jacobson wrote in her note. ""This decision is all the more difficult because of my profound belief in the importance of the U.S.-Mexico relationship and knowledge that it is at a crucial moment.""A career diplomat, Jacobson previously served as assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs and is seen as having a deep understanding of the region and the Mexico-U.S. relationship. She said she has spent more than 31 years in government service.Hicks, 29, is Trump’s longest serving aide, as she previously worked for him and his family before he announced his candidacy.“Hope is outstanding and has done great work for the last three years,” Trump said in a statement.“There are no words to adequately express my gratitude to President Trump,” Hicks, a former Ralph Lauren fashion model, said in a statement. “I wish the president and his administration the very best as he continues to lead our country.”The announcement came a day after Hicks acknowledged to a House intelligence panel that she has occasionally told ""white lies"" for Trump but denied lying about anything relevant to the Russia investigation. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Hicks' decision to leave the administration was “something that she’s been thinking about for a while.”Hicks, who largely worked behind the scenes during her tenure with Trump, found herself in the spotlight earlier this year when her relationship with former White House staff secretary Rob Porter was revealed. Porter left his job earlier in February after allegations surfaced that he physically abused his two ex-wives.Raffel joined the administration in the spring of 2017. He was hired to work on communications for the White House Office of American Innovation and also worked on behalf of Kushner and Trump. His portfolio of issues included tax reform and the Middle East peace process.In a statement, Ivanka Trump called Raffel ""honest, passionate and thoughtful,"" adding that his ""guidance was invaluable.""Raffel is expected to return to New York to join the private sector and tend to family obligations, Axios reported.Sorensen's ex-wife first told The Washington Post that he was violent and emotionally abusive during their marriage. He has denied the allegations. Sorensen's position did not require a security clearance, the White House said, adding that his background check was ongoing.Sorensen had worked as a senior adviser to Gov. Paul LePage, according to the Portland Press Herald. Brand, the No. 3 official in the Justice Department, served in the role for nine months before accepting a job with Walmart. She will serve as the retail giant's executive vice president, global governance and corporate secretary.In an interview with Fox News, Brand disputed claims that she left the administration due to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russia and the Trump campaign.Porter’s ex-wives told the Daily Mail that he was physically and mentally abusive.Porter denied the “outrageous allegations"" and resigned from his position.“I have been transparent and truthful about these vile claims, but I will not further engage publicly with a coordinated smear campaign,” Porter said.Two days after the resignation, Trump wished the former staffer well, saying he hopes Porter has ""a great career ahead of him."" He said the allegations were ""very sad"" and stressed that Porter has maintained his innocence.White House press secretary Sanders said on Dec. 13 that Manigault Newman’s last day with the administration would be on Jan. 20 – exactly one year since Trump’s inauguration.Manigault Newman reportedly drew scrutiny from White House chief of staff John Kelly. She also came under fire for bringing her 39-person bridal party to the White House for a photo shoot in 2017. Cordray’s resignation didn’t come as a surprise; he had previously said he would quit his job by the end of November. But many thought his resignation would set up Trump to appoint his own director of an agency that has been widely criticized by his administration and Republicans alike.However, before his resignation, Cordray elevated his chief of staff Leandra English to the deputy director position – meaning she would become acting CFPB director after he quit. But the White House announced Mick Mulvaney, head of the Office of Management and Budget, as its interim director.The move came after Price received major criticism following reports of his use of private planes.Price had promised to repay the government for the use of his costly flights and vowed never to take a private charter plane again while in his post as secretary but was ultimately let go anyway. White House officials told Fox News that Gorka did not resign but confirmed that he “no longer works” with the administration.However, Gorka insisted to the Washington Examiner that he did actually resign.A former Breitbart news editor, Gorka joined the Trump administration as a counterterrorism adviser and assisted with national security policy decisions alongside Bannon, according to White House sources.The Breitbart News chief joined Trump's presidential campaign and was later appointed to a senior adviser role after Trump won the election.Bannon, the hardcore populist, had become increasingly isolated inside the White House following John Kelly's appointment as chief of staff, White House sources and outside advisers told Fox News.A White House aide told Fox News that Bannon’s ouster wasn’t sudden; he submitted his resignation in writing several weeks prior, the aide said.But Scaramucci himself lasted only 10 days in the White House. He was reportedly removed at the request of new White House chief of staff John Kelly. Kelly was sworn in as chief of staff just hours before Scaramucci was removed. The replacement of Preibus as chief of staff came amid tensions between he and Scaramucci, the White House communications director at the time.“This is the problem with the leaking,” Scaramucci reportedly told reporters. “This is actually a terrible thing. Let’s say I’m firing Michael Short today. The fact that you guys know about it before he does really upsets me as a human being and as a Roman Catholic.”In his position, Shaub was often at odds with the Trump administration, particularly when it came to Trump’s business dealings.Shaub joined the Campaign Legal Center, an organization in Washington that mostly focuses on violations of campaign finance law.He said that he resigned due to “personal” reasons.Trump repeatedly criticized Comey’s handling of the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s personal email server, and Comey said after his firing that he felt uncomfortable by comments Trump made about the FBI’s investigation into Michael Flynn.Comey reportedly was speaking to employees in Los Angeles when news of his ousting came across the television. At the time, according to reports, Comey thought it was a prank.She left the White House to join the pro-Trump nonprofit America First Policies.Walsh came to the White House after serving in the Republican National Committee under then-chairman Reince Priebus.The Justice Department said attorneys general who were holdovers from the Obama administration needed to resign. Bharara refused to do so.“I did not resign. Moments ago I was fired,” Bharara tweeted. “Being the US Attorney in [the Southern District of New York] will forever be the greatest honor of my professional life.”“I have nothing to be ashamed for and everything to be proud of,” Flynn told Fox News at the time.Yates refused to enforce Trump’s controversial travel ban and issued a memo to the Justice Department not to defend the executive order.Fox News' Kristin Brown, Jake Gibson, Serafin Gomez, Alex Pappas, John Roberts, Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/19/jeanne-ives-makes-final-push-wide-open-illinois-governor-primary/","State Representative Jeanne Ives (R-Wheaton) is hoping to pull off an upset Tuesday against incumbent Republican governor Bruce Rauner, who is clinging to a narrow lead in the polls.Ives has run a conservative campaign focused on Rauner’s broken promises. He failed to stop the Democrat-dominated legislature from raising income taxes; failed to veto a bill to expand state funding for abortion, as he had indicated he would do; and signed legislation making Illinois a “sanctuary state” for illegal aliens.On the Democratic side, the race is also close. Frontrunner J.B. Pritzker is a billionaire heir to the Hyatt fortune and the choice of the party machine, led by State House Speaker Michael Madigan (D-Chicago).He is, however, closely pursued by left-wing State Sen. Daniel Biss (D-Evanston) and real estate magnate Chris Kennedy, the latest scion of the Kennedy clan to seek political office.Rauner’s defense against Ives’s challenge has been that she is “unelectable” because she is too conservative and openly supports President Donald Trump.However, opinion polls have shown that Rauner would lose to virtually any Democrat in the fall, partly because he lacks the support of his own base.Ives has also been targeted by the Democratic Governors Association, which is running ads against both Republican candidates — an indication of her strength. Her campaign accuses Democrats of meddling in the GOP primary.Pritzker is expected to win on Tuesday, but it is possible that Biss’s committed core of followers — many of whom also supported Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the 2016 presidential election — could make the difference.In low-turnout primary elections, enthusiasm can swing the results.Joel B.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/03/19/goldman-china-graduating-twice-many-doctorates-stem-fields-we-are/","David P. Goldman, economist, author, and Asia Times columnist whose pen name is “Spengler,” talked to Breitbart News Tonight co-hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak Thursday, warning of threats to America’s global position via China’s ascendance in science and technology.Goldman described China’s One Belt One Road project as placing the one-party state at the center of an increasingly prosperous economic region that is becoming more unified through digital and physical means. China’s increasing centrality to emerging Asian economies, he continued, may facilitate its rise to global economic preeminence.“Quietly, the rest of Asia, particularly Japan, is signing on to this Chinese [One Belt One Road] program, which is a trillion dollar budget to put in broadband, high-speed rail, all kinds of other infrastructure throughout Asia,” explained Goldman. “Like anything the Chinese do, it’s going to have mixed results. They’re not supermen. They make a lot of mistakes, but one of the most remarkable things that’s happening is that broadband and electronic commerce — the Chinese answer to Amazon, Alibaba, Jack Ma’s firm — is doing things which are transforming life in what used to be developing countries and bringing a couple of billion people into the modern world in a single generation, and it will have stunning economic effects and catapult China into, possibly, the leading position in the world economy. It’s an enormous challenge to us.”Goldman provided examples of China’s ascendance in science and technology relative to the U.S.“What I’m concerned about is the fact that China is testing a railgun mounted on a navy ship before the United States is and that China has the biggest quantum computing facility in the world about to open,” said Goldman. “It probably has more advanced research in quantum communications than we have, and they’re graduating twice as many doctorates in STEM fields than we are. That’s what really frightens me.”Goldman contrasted the status of airport and railway infrastructure between the U.S. and China. “Just stepping off a plane in Asia where all the airports are new, all the trains are fast, and all the escalators work; you get into JFK airport, it’s like going into a third world country. The people movers are busted. The escalators are busted. This morning I got to work on the brand new second avenue subway stop, which is the most expensive stretch of subway track in history; the escalator is broken. It’s frightening.”Goldman recommended a Reagan-style strategy — via state funding of research and development — to maintain America’s global scientific and technological edge.“Back in the Reagan administration … the United States spent about one percent to one and a quarter percent of GDP on basic fundamental scientific research,” recalled Goldman. “That’s the military stuff. Now, it’s about half that level. The one thing we’re better at doing than the Chinese is innovating. No question, we’re better. It doesn’t mean the Chinese can’t do it. It’s just that’s our advantage. It’s a tortoise and hare situation. If we throw resources into the frontiers of science and figure out how to knock missiles out of the sky, how to do quantum computing, how to trace Mr. Putin’s underwater drones with nuclear tips in the ocean — really tough problems and crack the — we’ll create new industries that nobody has dreamed of, and we’ll leapfrog the Chinese the way we leapfrogged the Russian empire during the 1980s. I think that’s the key to it.”Goldman assessed China’s news scientific and technological developments as a greater threat to America’s global status than Chinese theft of American intellectual property.[The Chinese] are developing a lot of their own science and technology themselves now,” stated Goldman. “A dozen years ago, Huawei … the single biggest telecom equipment producer in the world; they were caught with code from Cisco, which literally had the bugs in it. They basically stole the whole thing. Now Huawei spends as much on R&D as Microsoft or Google. They have bankrupted their competitors and hired all their engineers. Their biggest R&D centers aren’t in China; they’re in Ireland and Italy. I’m much more worried about what they’re doing going forward developing new stuff that we may not have than the old stuff that is stolen.”Mansour recounted Herb London’s description of Silicon Valley’s focus on social media services while China focuses on growing dominance in STEM fields.“We’re geeks in a new Roman Empire,” Goldman lamented.Goldman framed China’s modern instruments of social control as Orwellian tools that Joseph Stalin would have admired.“This is stuff Stalin couldn’t have imagined,” Goldman considered. “In China, they know where your smartphone is all the time, and they cross-check that against facial recognition cameras that they have every couple of hundred yards in cities. They check it against all of your social media postings, your online purchases. They have a database running in real time knowing where everybody is and what everybody is doing that Stalin couldn’t have imagined.”Goldman lamented what he described as the unlikelihood of political liberalization in China.“From the standpoint of delivering improvements in the basic conditions of life, the Chinese Communist party has done a pretty good job,” deduced Goldman. “And as long as it can continue to do so, the near-term prospects of regime change in China are about zero. I’m sorry to say that. I wish there was a way to change that, but I don’t think it’s a realistic assessment to say we can do something to make the Chinese government better than it is or do something that it doesn’t want to do.”“I think we should be very scared about China, but the question is, realistically, ‘What can we do to counter them?'” pondered Goldman. “We don’t want to throw them into chaos. That would mean war and depression and all kinds of terrible things. We want China to be secure but a lot weaker than we are, and I think that means doing what the Reagan administration did: going for breakthroughs in military technology that will establish American superiority in a way that nobody can doubt. That’s exactly what we haven’t done. Since the end of the Cold War, we’ve gotten lazy. We cut federal R&D. The great national labs are shadows of themselves. Big corporations like RCA and GE and IBM used to have big corporate labs that got funding from the Defense Department and built all this stuff that won the Cold War. They’re gone.”Breitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).LISTEN:Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/19/man-syndrome-tells-u-n-human-not-birth-defect/","John Franklin Stephens, a man with Down syndrome, told the United Nations that a world without people like him would be “a poorer world, a colder world, a less happy world.”In a moving speech before the 37th session of the Human Rights Council last week, Mr. Stephens told his audience that the most important thing that can be done to improve the lives of people with Down syndrome is to remember their status as human beings, equal in dignity to everyone else.“I am a man,” Stephens said. “See me as a human being, not a birth defect, not a syndrome. I don’t need to be eradicated. I don’t need to be cured. I need to be loved, valued, educated and, sometimes, helped.”Mr. Stephens was invited to speak at the U.N. days before the celebration of World Down Syndrome Day 2018, to be held on March 21.Ironically, his address came the day after an Ohio judge sided with the abortion industry and blocked a law that banned selective abortions targeting babies diagnosed with Down syndrome.“Federal law is crystal clear,” wrote Obama-appointee Judge Timothy S. Black of the U.S. District Court for Southern Ohio in a 22-page ruling granting a preliminary injunction against the state.Black wrote that the Ohio law “wrongfully” prohibits women from making the ultimate decision to terminate a pregnancy before viability. “It violates the right to privacy of every woman in Ohio and is unconstitutional on its face,” he added.Ohio Gov. John Kasich signed the “Down Syndrome Non-Discrimination Act” into law last December, banning selective abortions performed on babies diagnosed with Trisomy 21, or Down syndrome.In his speech before the U.N., Mr. Stephens brought up the uncomfortable comparison between aborting people with Down syndrome and other eugenic programs of the past.“How would the world react if a nation proclaimed that it would use genomic testing to make itself ‘Unpopular ethnic minority free’ by 2030?” he asked. “The U.N. has a name for this, but we need not go there.”“Instead,” he said, “let us pledge together to welcome diversity.”“Let us decide from this day forward to include, not exclude; educate, not isolate; and, celebrate, not terminate.”Despite the sober content of his talk, Mr. Stephens made room for humor as well.“People like me tend to be a little shorter because our arms and legs and shorter. Our faces are a little bit flatter because our cheekbones and noses don’t stick out from our faces as much,” he said. “All that adds up to a person who is a little bit uncommon, in my case, uncommonly handsome.”“Don’t worry, I am very accepting, very inclusive,” he continued. “I won’t think less of you just because I have more chromosomes than you do.”Stephens insisted that “a life with Down syndrome can be as full and exciting as any other,” using his own life as an example.He also thanked the Lejeune Foundation and Special Olympics for “freeing us from the prison of neglect,” saying that his generation owes such organizations “an awesome debt.”“I truly believe a world without people like me would be a poorer world, a colder world, a less happy world,” he said.To skeptics, Stephens pointed out the particular benefits provided by persons with Down syndrome to society at large.First, the extra chromosome present in persons with Down syndrome “makes us a blueprint for medical research in areas that include soft tissue cancer, heart disease, immune system disorders, and Alzheimer’s disease,” he said.In the second place, Stephens referenced a Harvard-based study that discovered that “people with Down syndrome, their parents, their siblings, and the people close to them are all happier than society at large” and therefore generate happiness for the world.They are also a reminder, he noted, of the dangers of eugenics and where it can lead. “Genomic research is not going to stop at screening for Down syndrome,” he warned. “We have an opportunity right now to slow down and think about the ethics of deciding that certain humans do not get a chance at life.”Watch the full speech here.Follow Thomas D.

Y’all better pay attention to this climate control, man, this climate manipulation,” White is heard saying on the video.“And D.C. keep talking about, ‘We a resilient city.’ And that’s a model based off the Rothschilds’ controlling the climate to create natural disasters so they can pay for to own the cities, man. Be careful,” he continued.The Rothschilds are a European Jewish family famous for generations of financiers and bankers and have been the subject of constant conspiracy theories.Local Jewish leaders were incensed by the councilman’s comments. Rabbi Daniel Zemel of Temple Micah in Northwest Washington slammed White’s remarks.“This kind of anti-Semitism is unacceptable in any public official. This so diminishes what America is about and adds to the oppressive feeling going on in the country right now,” Zemel said in a statement. “We all have to be better. Public officials have to learn not to say the first ignorant thing that comes into their head.”Initially, Councilman White did not understand why anyone would deem his comment anti-semitic. But after consulting with a representative of the Jewish community, White changed his tune.After the Post published a story revealing what he said, White apologized, saying he is a fast friend of the Jewish community.“I really do apologize. I work very closely with the Jewish community and never want to offend anyone, especially with Anti-Semitic remarks,” he tweeted on March 18.“I work hard every day to combat racism and prejudices of all kinds. I want to apologize to the Jewish Community and anyone I have offended,” White said. “The Jewish community have been allies with me in my journey to help people. I did not intend to be anti-Semitic, and I see I should not have said that after learning from my colleagues”:I really do apologize.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/19/9-democrat-lawmakers-ties-anti-semite-farrakhan/","Washington, DC, lawmaker Trayon White (D-Ward 8) is publicly blaming the Jews for creating the kind of weather conditions that will allow them to “own the cities”; thus, we can again see that anti-Semitism is a serious problem within the Democrat Party — that this hatred is tolerated, most especially, by a national media that do everything in their power to protect their allies on the political left.Therefore, this seems like a good time to look at all the elected Democrats associated with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a rabid and open anti-Semite.Just last month, at his annual Saviours’ Day address, Farrakhan gave a speech where he said the following:This is nothing new coming from Farrakhan. He has been spreading this poison for decades. Nevertheless, here are nine Democrat lawmakers with connections to the hate preacher, starting with a former president:The media merely attempted to downplay Obama’s troubling 20-year relationship with hate preacher Jeremiah Wright and his associations with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers. When it came to this photo of Obama and Farrakhan together, which was taken a mere three years before Obama ran for president, until Obama was safely out of elected office, the media completely covered it up.According to numerous reports, Ellison’s connections to Farrakhan are not only deep; the Democrat congressman has repeatedly lied about them. Nevertheless, he remains a deputy chairman of the whole Democrat Party.According to the Daily Caller, this powerful congresswoman, who constantly smears President Trump as racist, not only attended a Farrakhan speech, but was treated as a guest of honor.“We have Maxine Waters here,” Farrakhan said to a cheering audience, “our great congresswoman from this area.”Here is 2006 video of Farrakhan meeting with numerous members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Waters. The two of them hug like old friends at the 3:47 mark:In the same 2006 video embedded above, Lee is present.Davis, who has been in Congress for 21 years, has nothing but praise for the racist, anti-Semitic Farrakhan.“I personally know [Farrakhan], I’ve been to his home, done meetings, participated in events with him,” Davis told The Daily Caller. “I don’t regard Louis Farrakhan as an aberration or anything, I regard him as an outstanding human being who commands a following of individuals who are learned and articulate and he plays a big role in the lives of thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of people.”Carson met with the hate preacher in a hotel suite in 2015, refused to condemn his anti-Semitism, and will not rule out future meetings.Clyburn is the third-highest-ranking Democrat in the House, and in 2011, he shared a stage with Farrakhan. Clyburn also refused to denounce the Nation of Islam leader.Green can also be seen with Farrakhan in the video embedded above.Meeks met with Farrakhan in New York in 2011.  Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Worse, many of the users banned under this rule appear never to have broken Twitter’s rules, advocated violence, or made any threats against anyone.Social media plays a key role in driving the news cycle and political debates. It has become an important mechanism allowing individuals to participate in public affairs and interact with politicians, journalists, and government officials directly. In last year’s decision in Packingham v. North Carolina, the Supreme Court described social media sites like Facebook and Twitter as “the modern public square.” Selectively kicking off users with controversial viewpoints or off-platform affiliations thus poses a serious threat to American’s ability to freely express themselves.The current crackdown on conservatives using social media sites such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter has generated a great deal of controversy. It has also, understandably, sparked a number of lawsuits. We are counsel on one such suit, involving Jared Taylor, a self-described “race realist.” While Taylor’s views are controversial, that only reinforces the fact that his efforts to respectfully share those views must be protected. In the words of the late Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., “if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other, it is the principle of free thought — not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.”Our suit relies on a legal doctrine precisely tailored to this situation, developed by the state of California. In Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979), the California Supreme Court held that its state constitution’s protections for freedom of speech and petition apply to not just to the government, but to privately-owned public forums as well. Thus, students could not be prohibited from handing out “pro-Zionist” leaflets in a privately-owned shopping center. In a 1980 U.S. Supreme Court decision, the High Court found no conflict between California’s doctrine and the U.S. Constitution, squarely rejecting the shopping center’s argument that it had “a First Amendment right not to be forced by the State to use [its] property as a forum for the speech of others.” Thus, Twitter, though a private entity, cannot ban users because it disagrees with their viewpoints or off-platform affiliations.Professor Noah Feldman has argued that Twitter isn’t a public forum for others’ speech. Rather, it’s a “platform designed to deliver … Twitter’s expression.” In other words, all the millions of tweets, tweeted all over the world, all are “intended to express [Twitter’s’] own political values.” Therefore, the Pruneyard case would not apply; Twitter is no public forum and is free to ban anyone it disagrees with.But to claim that its platform expresses “its own political values” would be news to Twitter. Twitter’s stated corporate mission is to “[g]ive everyone the power to create and share ideas and information instantly, without barriers.” Its self-proclaimed corporate value is that it “believe[s] in free expression and believe every voice has the power to impact the world.” Twitter freely acknowledges that it is “the public square,” not a platform for its own corporate speech.Feldman argues that Twitter’s act of passively allowing millions of users across the globe to post their thoughts, feelings and media is equivalent to Twitter posting the exact same content from its own account. We contend this is absurd. Even Feldman acknowledges that “no one thinks that Twitter is doing the talking when individuals tweet from their own accounts.”How can Twitter be regarded as expressing itself through the Tweets of individual users when “no one thinks Twitter is doing the talking when individuals tweet from their own accounts”? Feldman does not explain, and his failure to do so is telling. It was for this very reason that the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the argument that California’s rule violates the First Amendment rights of the owners of public forums to prohibit speech on their premises. The Court found that there was no serious risk that the views expressed by individuals on the forum would be identified as those of the owner.Moreover, Twitter would never want to claim that all of its tweets express its “own political values.” If it did, it would run afoul of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. This federal statute grants “interactive computer services,” such as Twitter, Google, YouTube and Facebook , near total legal immunity from being held liable as “publishers” of their users’ content. For instance, Twitter is not liable for any libelous tweets on its platform.Most other industries do not enjoy Section 230’s extraordinary gift of “publisher” immunity. Classified ads can form the basis for legal liability for newspapers, and restaurants may have liability for libelous graffiti scrawled on their bathroom stall walls.
But Section 230 immunity is predicated on Twitter’s not being the speaker or publisher of its users’ tweets. Contrary to Professor Feldman, Twitter assuredly does not want its platform to “express its own political values” lest it face a blizzard of legal liability for every tortious statement made by any user of its platform.In our lawsuit, we argue Twitter can’t have it both ways. Either Twitter is a closed platform with liability for everything published therein, or it is an open platform that respects the rights of its users to respectfully share their views. What it cannot be is an unaccountable censor of public debate. Congress’s intention in drafting Section 230 was not to provide legal cover for large Internet companies to trample on the free speech rights of their users, but the exact opposite: to promote the development of the Internet as a forum for “a true diversity of political discourse” and “encourage the unfettered and unregulated development of free speech on the Internet.” Our lawsuit simply says that these large corporations cannot have their cake and eat it too — immunity from “publisher” liability, and the unfettered power to censor.Feldman accuses us of seeking to “turn[] social media platforms into free speech zones.” Instead, our suit contends that that’s precisely what they are already. As the Supreme Court noted in Packingham, “social media users employ these websites to engage in a wide array of protected First Amendment activity on topics as diverse as human thought.” Twitter has consistently marketed itself as an open forum for members of the public to express themselves. Having made this choice, Twitter must obey the laws that protect the public’s free speech rights in such forums. While the First Amendment does not apply to Twitter as a public entity, California has consistently held that its constitutional protection for free speech is broader than that of the First Amendment and applies to private entities that host public forums.California’s broad protection for free speech on public forums is also good public policy. Indeed, the implications of not recognizing Twitter as a “free speech zone,” but holding instead that it may practice viewpoint discrimination at will, are quite disturbing. It has been stated that no political candidate can win election without a Twitter presence. Can Twitter shut down the nascent political campaigns of those who disagree with its corporate policies by banning them? Will the precedent set by Twitter allow other social media platforms like Facebook and Google to search through users’ posts at will and delete ones it disagrees with?Feldman is incorrect in asserting that our lawsuit would leave social media platforms powerless to prevent abuse of the forum or protect other users. California law holds that Pruneyard public forums can impose reasonable “time, place and manner” restrictions on expressive activity, so long as those rules are enforced even-handedly. And Section 230 protects “any action voluntarily taken in good faith [by an interactive computer provider or user] to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.” This section was designed to allow website hosts to keep their sites “family friendly” without thereby being subjected to “publisher” liability for the statements of its users. It protects certain forms of regulation by website hosts, but with two important limitations: 1) the regulation must be undertaken in “good faith,” and 2) the restricted content must involve or be similar to pornography, graphic violence, obscenity, or harassment. But users who share their viewpoints in a respectful manner, and refrain from posting content that is obscene, violent, harassing, or the like, pose no threat to anyone. Section 230 provides no immunity for attempts to ban such users based on their controversial viewpoints or alleged off-platform affiliations.In today’s world, much of our public debate occurs on the “vast democratic forums of the Internet in general, and social media in particular.” Indeed, the Supreme Court in Packingham identified social media websites as “the most important places . . . for the exchange of views” in the modern day. Twitter now seeks to censor the expression of certain views on social media.Allowing Twitter to play this new role of viewpoint censor poses a direct threat to our “profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.” Our nation has a long and cherished tradition of protecting the rights of communists, radicals, religious minorities, and other speakers with controversial or unpopular views to speak in the public square.Discarding California’s Pruneyard Doctrine in the Internet age, as Feldman wishes to do, is dangerous and naïve. It would allow corporate America to destroy the vast power social media places in the hands of individuals to shape public debate. Like the shopping center in Pruneyard (which, as Feldman notes, strictly banned any expressive activities not related to commercial purposes), social media platforms could use their power to shut down any sort of meaningful debate. Perhaps Feldman, Twitter and others would prefer for public debate in the Internet age to be less wide-open and robust, and more timid and deferential. But allowing large tech companies to impose viewpoint censorship in hopes of achieving a better-mannered public debate is a fool’s bargain. It would have devastating consequences for our democracy for generations to come.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/03/19/cardinal-joseph-zen-china-no-truth-everything-fake/","The redoubtable Cardinal Joseph Zen has denounced proponents of an “imminent” accord between China and the Vatican, saying that the Church is setting itself up for a major disaster.The present historical reality we face in China is that of “a tiny flock being persecuted by a gigantic atheist power,” Zen said in a March 19 essay, and a Vatican capitulation to the terms of President Xi Jinping is the equivalent of “surrender,” something the Church has no reason to do.“Why surrender?” Zen asks. “Doesn’t the Vatican see that many churches survive in the underground community, such as in Hebei and Fujian?”“Doesn’t the Vatican know that in cities like Shanghai, many priests celebrate Sunday Mass in private homes for their faithful? There is still a certain degree of freedom for the ‘birds outside the cage.’ But now things are going to change. The Vatican is coming to help the Government to push everybody into the cage,” he added.In his essay, Cardinal Zen was responding to several recent articles critical of his position and supportive of full integration with the government-controlled Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association, a church set up by the communist party in 1957 as an alternative to the Church of Rome.In one of those articles, Fr. Jeroom Heyndrickx, a Belgian missionary priest and advisor to the Vatican, wrote that if the Vatican signs an agreement with the Chinese government on the appointment of bishops, “then 2018 may become the ‘Year of Truth’ for the Church in China.”The signing of an agreement would be a “blessing” for the Catholic faithful in China, Fr. Heyndrickx asserts, “because it will enable them to openly celebrate their faith in one community,” something that is “crucial” for all Christians.In his article, the priest criticizes “Catholic experts” who have expressed reservations regarding the pact, especially the claim (which Cardinal Zen has often repeated) “that the Vatican does not know China from the inside.”These critics have the situation backward, Heyndrickx claims, since Vatican experts have “visited China personally several times,” they have met with Chinese bishops “both official and nonofficial,” and they have “discussed problems personally with civil authorities.”“There is no other place in the whole Universal Church — not even in Asia — where more information on the real situation of the Church in China can be found” than in the Vatican, he states, adding that “nobody is better informed on the Church in China than the Pope.”The problem with Fr. Heyndrickx’s assertion is that recent statements made by the pope and his closest co-workers suggest that their knowledge of the situation of the Church in China may not be as comprehensive as he thinks.Last year, Pope Francis publicly defended Communist China’s practice of religious liberty, insisting that in China churches are full and religion is freely practiced, an assertion contradicted by reports by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) as well as Christian persecution watchdog groups.“In China the churches are full,” Francis insisted. “You can practice your faith in China.”In its most recent annual report, however, the USCIRF once again designated China as a “country of particular concern,” noting that the Chinese government is guilty of “particularly severe violations of religious freedom.”“As the Chinese government aggressively asserts itself on the global stage, at home it aggressively violates the human rights and religious freedom of its citizens,” said USCIRF Chairman Thomas J. Reese, S.J.The pope is not alone in his seemingly naïve assessment of life in China. The chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, fellow Argentinean Bishop Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, shares the pontiff’s rosy outlook on Chinese society, and recently declared that China provides the best model of a country that implements Catholic social teaching.The Chinese “look for the common good and subordinate other things to the general welfare,” Sánchez insisted.“You don’t have shantytowns, you don’t have drugs, young people do not take drugs. There is like a positive national consciousness, they want to show that they have changed, and now they accept private property,” he said.In his essay, Cardinal Zen said he could not help reacting to Fr. Heyndrickx’s “pathetic sermon,” referring to him derisively as the “Godfather” of China experts.Saying that 2018 could be “the year of truth” for Chinese Catholics is ironic, the cardinal notes, since the truth is on very short supply in China.“The truth doesn’t enjoy good health or high esteem nowadays in China,” Zen wrote. “Everything is fake, from food to medicine. You are not expected to tell the truth, just say what the boss wants to hear.”As for the signing of the agreement being a “blessing” because it will enable the Catholic faithful in China “to openly celebrate their faith in one community,” Zen is not convinced.“Where? In a church registered with the Patriotic Association, under surveillance cameras, listening to a priest preaching the latest instruction from the reigning President-Emperor?!” Zen wrote.“Surely this is not a normal way to profess the faith, as it is done in any Catholic church in the world!” he added.“Fr. Heyndrickx has learned a lot from the Chinese, who are masters of word play,” Zen said. “Beautiful words: ‘To openly celebrate their faith in one community,’ and ‘restoring church unity and normalization in China.’”“The Reality is this,” Zen concludes. “People who for years, bearing all sorts of discrimination and harassment, kept their loyalty to the true faith under the authority of the Pope, are now forced by the Vatican into the same ‘prison,’ led by Government officials dressed up as ministers of God.”Follow Thomas D.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2018/03/19/media-fail-60-troubled-deep-states-public-policy-manipulation/","With the news that 74 percent of Americans believe a Deep State exists, a Monmouth University poll reveals just how little influence the disgraced national media have over public opinion and perception.The Deep State, which is correctly defined in the polling question as “a group of unelected or appointed government officials who have too much influence in determining federal policy,” has been a national issue since the rise of President Donald Trump. Ever since this conversation started, though, the media have been slashing away at the discussion as a fevered conspiracy ginned up by conservatives.The media pushback has obviously failed because there is no notable partisan distinction in the poll. Monmouth reports, “This is a worrisome finding. The strength of our government relies on public faith in protecting our freedoms, which is not particularly robust. And it’s not a Democratic or Republican issue. These concerns span the political spectrum.”Moreover, only 21 percent think the Deep State does not exist.While 47 percent say it “probably exists,” 27 percent believe it “definitely exists.”As far as “unelected or appointed government officials hav[ing] too much influence in determining federal policy,” 60 percent agree. This includes 59 percent of Democrats, 59 percent of Republicans, and 62 percent of independents.Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians believe more strongly in the existence of a Deep State. While 35 percent believe it “definitely exists,” only 23 percent of whites agree.According to the poll, “Non-whites (60%) are also somewhat more likely than whites (50%) to worry about the government monitoring them and similarly more likely to believe there is already widespread government monitoring of U.S. citizens (60% and 49%, respectively).”NRA members are more likely than non-NRA members to believe a D.C .Deep State “definitely exists,” 43 percent to 25 percent, respectively.A whopping 80 percent believe the government spies on American citizens. A majority of 53 percent believe this is widespread. Only 18 percent believe this spying is justified.Despite the media’s best efforts to laugh off our concern about unelected bureaucrats making policies that affect all of our lives, part of the reason the American people might be so unified in this belief could be due to those times when the Deep State has revealed itself.The FBI has been involved in a number of scandals that appear to involve the manipulation of the 2016 presidential election in favor of Hillary Clinton. We have also seen powerful politicians, such as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), openly warn politicians, including Trump, about the ways in which the unelected intelligence community can punish the American people’s elected representatives — a terrifying thought to anyone who does not want to live in a country run by secret police.While the far-left mainstream media want us to believe the Deep State does not exist, they also want us to believe that the federal bureaucracy and intelligence community are the adults in the room. This is especially true now that voters have given Republicans total control over the federal government. This poll shows that the American people are not buying either media argument — that they still believe policy should be created only by those elected by the people to make policy. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

It may not be universally true or easy to hear, but yes, it’s a dynamic still at play in our society. I know this because even I spent parts of my life wondering if I could achieve the same as male leaders, and a lot of that insecurity stemmed from my gender and how society views women. When I was serving in various roles in public life, I was always more popular when I was working for or defending a man then when I was out there on my own.She admitted that she may have upset some people but insisted that she “meant no disrespect to any individual or group” with her comments.Clinton concluded by again sounding the alarm of Russian election meddling and “fake news” on social media.She also challenged Trump’s winning presidential campaign slogan, insistent that she did not agree with it.“’Make America Great AGAIN’ suggests that to be great we have to go back to something we are no longer,” Clinton wrote. “I never accepted that and never will.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

They argue the disclosures are so broad and onerous “that it is difficult, if not impossible, for unlicensed centers to advocate their own pro-life message in most media.” The centers are also forced to “begin their expressive relationship with an immediate unwanted or negative message that crowds out and confuses their intended message.”The U.S. District Court ruled against the centers, and the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, but the U.S. Supreme Court took the appeal.The Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) network of 3,200 faith-based attorneys is now representing the Christian centers.

The names of both women have been withheld in news reports.The couple turned to a Danish clinic for assisted procreation, which used the sperm from an anonymous donor to fertilize an ovum of the American woman. The Italian birth certificate issued at the time carried only the name of the American birth mother who carried the child to term, noting that the baby was conceived through heterologous in vitro fertilization.“Our child is registered only as the son of my wife, and since she is American, I cannot confer Italian citizenship on him, which means a lot to us, despite the fact that our country does not treat us as equals to all other citizens,” the Italian woman told local media. “We decided to have him born here because this is home, but Italy considers the child a foreigner with only one parent.”“In my country, the child would be immediately registered as the son of both,” the American partner said. “I feel my blood freeze when I think that in Italy he is denied such a basic right.”After the registrar’s refusal to indicate both parents on the birth certificate, the two women appealed to the Court of Pisa.“If the child had been born in the United States, the birth certificate with the double maternity would be transcribed here without problems,” said the women’s attorney, Alexander Schuster. “But since the birth took place in Italy, the United States must now rely on the Italian document that indicates only one parent and it cannot add the other mother in drafting its documents.”Judge Marco Viani of the Court of Pisa said he doubts the constitutional legitimacy of the law that does not allow for the drafting of a birth certificate in Italy in which two persons of the same sex are recognized as parents of a foreign national, because it “unreasonably restricts the right of persons who, according to the applicable foreign law, are bound by a parental-filial relationship to have their union fully recognized in Italy.”The judge also recalled that “the best interests of the child must be a primary consideration” in determining how to apply existing laws, which may mean giving precedence to the American law that allows for the recognition of both women as parents to the child.The case is now in the hands of constitutional judges who will have the final say over whether or not to accept the ruling of the Court of Pisa.Prior to Italy’s March 4 national elections, the Democratic Party (PD) pushed for the recognition of homosexual civil unions as part of its campaign platform and hung posters to this effect around major cities.The PD was trounced in the elections, falling to a record low of 18.7 percent of the vote.

And I’ve always been a supporter of those policies,” he said. Speaking of the third congressional district where he is running, Tarkanian said, “It’s a district that has more conservative voters out there and it’s a seat that … it’s very winnable.”Asked whether he is still fighting for the same things that Trump is, Tarkanian said his strong convictions for his political beliefs are very much in line with Trump’s America First agenda. “I don’t flip-flop on my positions,” he added.“I support President Trump and what he’s trying to do,” Tarkanian said of his reasons for first entering the U.S. Senate race and now having moved to run for the third district congressional seat.Tarkanian recalled messages from Nevadans, asking him to run against Heller before he took up a primary challenge to the senator. But when Trump asked him to move to the congressional race to best serve the America First agenda, Tarkanian did so to support the president.Host Amanda House asked Tarkanian about his comparison between the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump and Dean Heller. He stated that Ivanka Trump herself would likely call herself a moderate. “Everybody knows Dean Heller is not a conservative, he’s more of a moderate and he flip-flops on positions. That isn’t something that’s debatable if you look at his record. He’s one of the lowest scores on all of the conservative scorecards.”Boyle asked Tarkanian to explain the need for a wall on the U.S. southern border.“Common sense tells you you can’t have a sovereign country with a rule of law if you can’t protect who’s coming in and out of the country and what’s coming in and out of the country,” replied Tarkanian.The now-congressional candidate then slammed Democrats for obstructing construction of a southern border wall after they “voted for the wall in the early 2000s.”“They’re only against it now because President Trump and the Republican Party want to have it done,” he charged. He said that when not identified with Trump’s request, an “overwhelming majority” of Nevadans would support a wall.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

I went off to Chicago trading cattle and then around the world trading currencies and worked for Goldman Sachs and several financial firms. I was in the hedge fund business for a while in Mississippi along with a couple other businessmen here, started a bank that’s been successful in Mississippi and employs over 500 people.The Mississippi Republican said, “I want to give back and grow Mississippi incomes and I think I can do that, Matt, I’m learning a lot about running for office.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/18/what-would-theodore-roosevelt-do-an-anti-trust-reckoning-for-the-tech-lords/","Roosevelt Lives! Theodore Roosevelt, our 26th president, left the White House in 1909, and yet his spirit — larger than life and larger, even, than death — is still with us. And that is in no small part because many of the problems that the Great Trustbuster grappled with back then seem so similar to the problems we confront today.For instance, here is a headline that appeared in The Seattle Times over the weekend: “Big Tech needs to face a Theodore Roosevelt-style trust busting.”Perhaps that piece, by columnist Jon Talton, caught the eye of the world’s richest man, Jeff Bezos, whose company, Amazon, is based in Seattle. And yet columnist Talton is clearly not a fan of his tech homeboys, nor of the other big tech firms further down the left coast:Big Tech’s greatest sins are locking in a winner-take-all economy, decimating the middle class and exercising monopoly-like powers that cause the free market to fail. Competition is stymied. Power is in the hands of too few.As we old Romans like to say say, Aperta sunt prata et quod puts in quo equi non pervenit (That puts the hay down where the horse can get it).We might note that the Seattle area is also home to the world’s second-richest man, Bill Gates, who co-founded another tech giant, Microsoft, way back in 1975. Talton writes unkindly of that older company — which was formally judged to be an “abusive monopoly” in 2000 — describing it as “the original gangster.”Yet the newer tech companies, Talton asserts, are no better, even if they have better people skills:Unlike Microsoft, which was typecast early on as the “Evil Empire,” Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon have combined savvy public-relations efforts with sophisticated political lobbying operations.Indeed, politically correct schmoozing has kept the new tech titans out of trouble — at least until recently. And yet now the political wheel is turning as many in the chattering class join Talton in calling for anti-trust action. As Virgil noted recently, every day brings a new revelation — or at least a new accusation — against Big Tech.So it’s no wonder that just as TR is making a comeback, so too is the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890. Indeed, that comeback is bipartisan: “The Democrats rediscover antitrust” was a 2017 headline in The Hill, a D.C.-insider publication. Meanwhile, Josh Hawley, the Republican attorney general of Missouri, is going specifically after Google. (Hawley, it is worth noting, was the author, a decade ago, of an admiring book on TR; he is now running for the U.S. Senate, and, in fact, this month, President Donald Trump appeared at a St. Louis fundraiser for him.)During Teddy Roosevelt’s time in office, 1901-1909, his administration filed some 40 anti-trust actions, although perhaps the most famous application of the Sherman Act was resolved only in 1911, after Roosevelt had departed office. That was the case of U.S. vs. Standard Oil, which broke the vast oil monopoly into 33 different corporate pieces.Without a doubt, anti-trust breakup is a drastic remedy, but it is not that drastic, in the sense that it does not involve forfeiture of assets. And so, for example, even though Standard Oil was legally smithereened, its owner, John D. Rockefeller, did not lose any money; he simply took separate ownership of the newly separated entities. Indeed, the mogul soon discovered that the new constellation of companies was actually worth more than the old consolidated Standard Oil.And so today, as the Trump Justice Department’s anti-trust suit against AT&T’s attempt to buy Time Warner goes to trial, we can observe that even if the DOJ suit prevails, AT&T and Time Warner will be fine; they will simply continue to be indvidually profitable mega corporations.Looking ahead, we can see that more antitrust litigation is inevitable, and some of it may yet be painful to the defendants. For instance, we might note that private anti-trust litigation is also possible. And under the provisions of the Clayton Anti-Trust Act of 1914, a successor to Sherman, economic victims of monopolistic abuse can sue, through private action, for treble damages. In other words, all the myriad media companies that have suffered so much financial damage from Facebook and Google might have a legal remedy.Yet before the new anti-trust train gets too far down the track, we might stop and ask ourselves: What is the desired end goal here? That is, do we think the problem is that Big Tech is too big or simply that it’s misbehaving? That is a distinction worth pausing over because big doesn’t automatically mean bad, and small doesn’t automatically mean good. To put it another way, the quality of a company might well be different from its quantity. Virtue, or not, comes in all sizes.To illustrate, let’s suppose that, say, Facebook finds itself trust-busted. Such an outcome might be satisfying for many, but the change might prove to be illusory.That is, if the dangers Facebook poses today are that it is liberal, biased, and careless with its data, we must ask: Would any of those flaws be lessened if the company was broken up into five, or fifteen, or twenty-five different social-media companies?After all, as with Standard Oil a century ago, those pieces would all still be owned, and likely controlled, by Mark Zuckerberg and his corporate-culture allies. That is, even in the wake of a trust-busting — which could take a decade or more to work through the courts — it is quite likely that the same Silicon Valley liberals would control each and every piece.Moreover, precisely because of their profusion, the pieces would be harder to monitor. And finally, crucially, they might be harder to secure against hacking and manipulating. Why is that? Because security is expensive, and smaller companies would be more tempted to scrimp.So we can see: It is not at all certain that simply taking a hammer to big obnoxious companies does anything other than turn them into a bunch of smaller obnoxious companies.Interestingly, one keen observer who shared this concern, in his time, was Theodore Roosevelt.What Roosevelt Believed In: A Square Deal for AllRoosevelt came into office in 1901 firmly convinced that something needed to be done about corporate abuses. TR was essentially conservative in his views — he was, after all, a well-off patriotic war veteran — and yet he could see that reform was needed.Indeed, as early as 1883, when he was still in his twenties, TR had worried that abuses, if left unchecked, could lead to unrest, even revolution:There is a strong and growing feeling of indignation among the people at the actions of these great corporations. It is incumbent upon us to see that this feeling takes a lawful shape … For the sake of protecting honest capital, we ought to punish, if we legally can, the deed of the dishonest wealthy for fear that some day an uprising might come that will overwhelm innocent and guilty alike.In these words from the young Roosevelt, we see many of the key themes that would guide his entire public career: “Public outrage is justified, and yet we don’t want socialism or communism — instead, we want prudent reform.”In that conservative reformist vein, TR used the phrase “Square Deal.” In 1901, for example, he called for “a square deal for every man, big or small, rich or poor.” That is, everybody should be included, even as nobody should be ripped off.So while President Roosevelt was fully aware of the Sherman Act — and was, as we have seen, willing to use it — his actual preferred solution was regulation, not litigation. His argument can be stated simply: If corporations are doing wrong, then the thing to do is to pass a law to stop them from doing wrong, right away. By contrast, the narrower anti-trust solution is, at best, retroactive, and at worst, so slow as to be ineffective at stopping abuse.Arguing on behalf of the regulatory remedy in 1907, TR declared:The design should be to prevent the abuses incident to the creation of unhealthy and improper combinations, instead of waiting until they are in existence and then attempting to destroy them by civil or criminal proceedings.Once again, TR’s idea was to use regulation to get ahead of a problem. Using litigation after the fact — that is, to go chasing after the problem after it had manifested itself — was better than nothing, and yet it was not best.Indeed, six years earlier, in 1901, TR had called upon Congress to create a new Cabinet body, a “Department of Commerce and Industries,’’ to oversee commercial activity “in the broadest sense.” In Roosevelt’s telling, it would be……a comprehensive and far-reaching scheme of constructive statesmanship for the purpose of broadening our markets, securing our business interests on a safe basis, and making firm our new position in the international industrial world; while scrupulously safeguarding the rights of wage-worker and capitalist, of investor and private citizen, so as to secure equity as between man and man in this Republic.So again, we see the essence of the Rooseveltian Square Deal: TR did not want to pit one interest or class against another; he wanted to see all treated fairly.Indeed, amidst the worker protections that TR wished to guarantee, we might pause over another phrase from that 1901 communique: “making firm our new position in the international industrial world.” Here Roosevelt was talking the muscular talk of economic nationalism. That is, even as he wanted social justice for Americans at home, he wanted economic advancement for American firms abroad. After all, he reasoned, the better for American capitalists, the better for American workers. As TR said in 1904, “We shall have to work out methods of controlling the big corporations without paralyzing the energies of the business community.”Today, such thinking is put in the category of aiding “national champion” industries. And of course, it is not limited to the U.S.; just about every modern country seeks to help its companies succeed in the global market.Back then, TR’s idea for a new department was embraced by Congress, but it was also somewhat changed; in 1903, the Department of Commerce and Labor was established. A decade later, the “labor” part was peeled off to become the separate Department of Labor, and then, in 1914, the regulatory functions of the Commerce Department were turned over to the new Federal Trade Commission.To be sure, some will look back at these bureaucratic formations with a certain distaste, perhaps even outright libertarian disdain. And yet it is hard to imagine what American life would be like today without key business regulation.Or maybe it isn’t so hard to imagine it because what we’re seeing, today, is what it’s like when Big Tech is essentially unregulated.Yet in the meantime, according to the polls, most Americans support more regulation — and as the disturbing revelations about Big Tech keep mounting, it is hard to see how that support won’t continue to grow. The challenge is to make it the right sort of litigation, so that our companies can expand in ways that help both their owners and the nation as a whole — and not in ways that hurt the nation.So yes, in a way, it’s like we are back in the days of President Theodore Roosevelt. And if so, it is worth understanding the actual legal and political mechanics of the Square Deal. We ought to learn from the master himself.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/18/coulter-trump-prototypes-wall-ridiculous/","New York Times best-selling author and populist conservative columnist Ann Coulter says President Trump’s border wall prototypes sitting in the San Diego, California, desert are “a ridiculous waste of time.”During an interview on KABC Los Angeles, Coulter mocked Trump’s border wall prototypes after the president visited the structures last week, as Breitbart News reported. According to Coulter:They’re very good at stopping any illegal alien prototypes. … I don’t know why we need prototypes, except that it’s all just a fakeout and the whole thing about building a wall is just ‘I’m going to get four years saying I’m going to build the wall and inspecting prototypes, but I’ll never actually build the wall.’ … No, it’s a ridiculous waste of time. [Emphasis added]Coulter said the U.S. should model its illegal immigration policies on Israel’s successful effort that has ended all illegal immigration into the country, as noted by Breitbart Israel Bureau Chief Aaron Klein. Coulter said:I’ll take whatever Israel has because it’s working 100 percent. … They have a huge problem with illegal aliens and they’re fantastic. I mean, I have a whole chapter in ‘Adios, America’ about ‘Why can’t we have Israel’s plan on immigration?’ … They take illegal aliens and just fly them to other countries and drop them off in the desert.Klein noted at the beginning of 2018 how Trump’s effort to stop illegal immigration pouring across the U.S.-Mexico border should be modeled off Israel in five simple points:As Breitbart News previously reported, despite more than a year now into Trump’s presidency, a border wall remains unconstructed along the southern border with no clear vision in sight of when the project will break ground.The border wall prototypes in San Diego have been collecting dust in the desert for over half a year now, though some experts say none of the prototypes will ever be chosen and that the border wall will be mash-up of multiple elements from each prototype.In the meantime, wage growth for American workers is at risk as illegal immigration is set to majorly increase this year.Wage Growth for American Workers Threatened by Lack of Wall, Expected Rise in Illegal Immigrationhttps://t.co/4c0aYxs73j— John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) March 16, 2018Princeton Policy Adviser President Steven Kopits says illegal immigration in 2018 is likely to increase by 70 percent—or about 590,000 border-crossings for 2018.Such an increase, Kopits told the Washington Examiner, would put 2018 as the “second highest year since 2010” for illegal immigration on the southern border.In Kopits’ most recent report on illegal immigration, he notes that California’s farm wages for Americans have increased because of slower illegal immigration throughout 2017 and increased enforcement, with the caveat, “However, the more enforcement succeeds, the higher wages will go, and the greater the incentive to evade the ban. In California, for example, tougher border enforcement has raised farm wages to $16 / hour, up perhaps $5 / hour over earlier times.”Those wages gains, though, risk being depleted this year. Also running the risk of being depleted is history-making wage growth for American workers in the construction industry, the garment industry, for workers employed at small businesses, and black Americans.A whistleblower in the California construction business most recently revealed how mass immigration and illegal aliens contributed in driving down Americans’ wages in the industry, Breitbart News reported:WHISTLEBLOWER: If I hired a framer to do a small addition [in 1988], his wage would have been $45 an hour. That was the minimum for a framing contractor, a good carpenter. [Emphasis added]…Now, the average wage in Los Angeles for construction workers is less than $11 an hour. They can’t go lower than the minimum wage. [Emphasis added]Every year the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million illegal and legal immigrants, consisting of mostly low-skilled foreign nationals who are only entering the country because they have foreign relatives already living in the U.S. In 2016, the illegal and legal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

He detailed how the Chinese regime purchases political influence in America via the cultivation of economic relationships with prominent politicians’ family members, including, as Schweizer’s book reveals, the son of Joe Biden, the father- and sister-in-law of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and the son-in-law of President Donald Trump.In his interview Friday with Breitbart Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour, Mosher praised Schweizer’s past work, as president of the Government Accountability Institute, in exposing government corruption.“I have to say that Peter Schweizer — who I’ve known for many years and I regard as a friend — is just a bulldog when it comes to this kind of thing,” Mosher said. “He does his research, he’s gone into the Chinese language websites of some of these firms and translated them into English and made accessible to us information that we would never otherwise know. It’s an amazing piece of research.”Mansour and her guest co-host, actress and author Sam Sorbo, detailed the revelations in Schweizer’s book concerning the Chinese government’s influence peddling in America, including the close ties between the Chinese regime and the family shipping business founded by Elaine Chao’s father. Elaine Chao is Mitch McConnell’s wife and President Trump’s Transportation Secretary. McConnell’s sister- and father-in-law both sat on the board of China State Shipbuilding Corp. (CSSC), a state-run shipbuilding company described by Schweizer as “a state-owned defense conglomerate … at the heart of the Chinese government’s military-industrial complex.”Mansour further noted that, according to Schweizer’s research, the Chinese government-controlled Bank of China appointed McConnell’s sister-in-law, Angela Chao, to its board of directors “shortly after President Trump was elected.” “The bank’s board of directors up until that point included all senior Chinese officials and one lone Dutch banker,” said Mansour, before sarcastically remarking, “Now, I’m sure it was all based on [Angela Chao’s] qualifications, and she was the most qualified member of Mitch McConnell’s family to get that position. So I don’t think we have anything to worry about.”Mosher described China’s influence peddling as a “reverse King Midas effect,” drawing on the Greek mythological figure’s ability to turn things to gold with a touch. The Chinese, he said, held gold in their hands as they sought to purchase influence from various figures and companies. He further explained how corrupt influence peddling is deeply rooted in Chinese political history. “What we see in China is kind of a reverse King Midas effect,” said Mosher. “We all remember the Greek story of King Midas, who whenever he touched something it turned to gold. Well, whenever the Chinese communists touch anything, they have gold in their hands and they want to pass it along to the person or company they’re dealing with, so it really is all buying influence. This has a long history in China, by the way, going back a couple of thousand years.” Mosher explained, “When Chinese officials were appointed to govern a province or …. a county, the emperor who appointed them did not give them a budget, he just gave them permission to go to that county [or] province and extort, accept bribes, accept fees of various kinds, and tax the people into poverty. They were expected to raise their own money [and] budget to support themselves, their households, and all their employees in the official government residence…. They would be on the take from the get-go. That’s what was expected of them, so it was officially sanctioned corruption.”“The political culture of China from the beginning has been based on this kind of corruption of officials using their authority [and] power to make money [and] to use money to make even more money,” said Mosher. “What we now see on the international stage is this whole Chinese gold play that happens inside of China — it’s happened for hundreds of years — now it’s being exported to other parts of the world like the United States, and again, the reverse King Midas effect, how they’re corrupting everything they touch including the family members of American politicians who actually may not be that hard to bring around to the Chinese point of view.”“What did China get in exchange?” Mansour asked Mosher.“I think there’s no question that China wants something in exchange,” replied Mosher. “These are not free gifts. This is not a market-based investment, for example, into the Rosemont Seneca firm that was set up by Hunter Biden [and] Devon Archer, as [Peter Schweizer] reports. This was a calculated effort to buy influence with the son of the vice president of the United States. … Had you or I walked in with the same proposal, we wouldn’t even have gotten past the receptionist. These people were able to get in because of their parents [and] their family connections to see very high-level officials who consciously wanted to ink a deal in order to rope them into the Chinese way of seeing and doing things.”Mosher explained the revelation in Schweizer’s book concerning a billion-dollar investment firm established by Hunter Biden — Joe Biden’s son — and the state-run Bank of China.“In [Peter Schweizer’s] account that was published in the New York Post, it’s very clear that one of the consequences of this one-billion dollar investment fund that was set up and guaranteed by China — by the way, so you can’t lose money, again, it’s not a market-based decision; if the Chinese government is guaranteeing the fund then it’s a no-lose proposition — and they went out and bought an American company that had a dual-use technology that was useful in not just a commercial sense, but in a military sense, as well, and for some reason this sale, which should have been blocked, was approved,” related Mosher. “So, I think you can see how it works.”In 2015, the Obama administration approved a Chinese state-owned company’s 51-percent-majority purchase of Henniges, an American “dual-use” parts manufacturer involved in the production of “anti-vibration” automotive technologies with possible military applications. The deal was approved by the the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), speculated Mosher, in part due to a Biden-linked firm’s purchasing of the remaining 49-percent-minority stake in Henniges.Sorbo noted how Thornton Group —  a “politically connected consultancy firm” connected to Rosemont Seneca — documented its meeting in China with Hunter Biden on the Chinese-language side of its website, but omitted such details from its English-language website.“On the Chinese side, they were happy to brag about how they had managed to win influence and buy friends in the United States, and yet their American partners were much more reticent to reveal exactly what was going on,” stated Mosher. “I wonder why.”Sorbo framed Chinese purchasing of political influence as a function of a self-serving domestic political class: “This is what you get when you get a political class, an elite class, and they feel that they’re untouchable, and they’re using their political power and their access to their own benefit.”“It’s influence peddling of the worst kind,” concurred Mosher. “Going back a hundred years, Warren G. Harding got in trouble because his energy secretary was dealing in oil leases. This is far worse than the kind of scandals and corruption we’ve seen in American history because it deals with a selling out America to a hostile foreign power. China does not wish us well. China wishes to replace us on the world stage, and they’re buying influence and buying companies and stealing technology piecemeal. But they have a plan. This is not happening just by chance. They’re targeting the family members of powerful influential American politicians, offering them sweetheart deals knowing that once the deal is inked that they will have that family not in their pocket necessarily, but they’ll certainly get a sympathetic hearing on any China issues that comes up.”Mosher didn’t question Joe  Biden’s patriotism, but noted that when the company or firm of a politician’s family member receives “enormous benefits from these sweetheart deals… it has to soften their views on America’s stance towards China.”Sorbo challenged Mosher’s assessment of Biden’s intentions: “I might have a bit of a harder line than you on this, because my understanding is that Biden flew over [to China] for meetings and brought his son. So he’s the one parading his son around saying, ‘Look at my fine young man. Can you do anything for him?'”Mosher also noted China’s efforts to influence Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor, by offering him $600 million towards an outstanding debt on a Manhattan property owed by Kushner’s family business.“The Chinese came in and offered [Jared Kushner] $600 million to prop up his loan for the 666 Fifth Avenue building, which is heavily in debt,” said Mosher. “He turned down the offer, but you can see how the Chinese are playing this game. They pick targets of opportunity. Sometimes they succeed. Sometimes they don’t, but every time they succeed they chisel away at American resolve to confront what is, after all, I think a mortal danger to the American republic, a mortal danger certainly to the rule of law in the world and the current world order.”Peter Schweizer’s new book Secret Empires will hit bookstores nationwide on Tuesday, March 20.Breitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).LISTEN:Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

He added that the Czech president also planned to host an Israeli Independence Day celebration at his residence next month.“The discussions [on this issue] continue and we have learned that a ministerial team was also set up, including the president’s adviser, the deputy foreign minister and the prime minister’s adviser for internal coordination on the possibility of transferring the embassy to Jerusalem,” Meron wrote.A local Czech paper two weeks ago reported that Zeman wants to follow the lead set by the U.S. and expedite the embassy relocation process. However, the Lidové noviny newspaper also said that the Czech foreign ministry was against the move because of concerns about a backlash from its European Union partners.“It makes me truly happy because, as I said during my visit to Israel four years ago, I would appreciate the transfer of the Czech embassy to Jerusalem, and had it happened, we would have been the first to do so,” said Zeman in December. “Now we may sooner or later follow the United States.

It is one of three “sanctuary state” laws that is being challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice on constitutional grounds.According to legal experts, it is the only one of the three laws that has a chance of surviving. However, Los Alamitos is not waiting for the courts to rule.The Orange County Register notes:The state law, which took effect Jan. 1, “may be in direct conflict with federal laws and the Constitution of the United States,” reads the proposed local law.Stating that council members have taken an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution, the ordinance says the council “finds that it is impossible to honor our oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States” and at the same time be in compliance with the new state law.Supporters of the proposed city ordinance say that the city council members took an oath to defend the Constitution when they assumed their local offices, and that their duty supersedes the state legislature’s effort to resist federal immigration law.However, critics say that the state law does not conflict with the Constitution.Orange County has traditionally been a conservative stronghold, but the county was won by Hillary Clinton in 2016, and Democrats hope to build on that showing to unseat several Republicans in the U.S. House this year.The Los Alamitos ordinance is one of several efforts by conservative regions of the state to chart a different path from the Democrat-dominated state government.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/news/apnewsbreak-some-wanted-florida-suspect-committed-in-2016/","MIAMI (AP) — Officials were so concerned about the mental stability of the student accused of last month’s Florida school massacre that they decided he should be forcibly committed.But the recommendation was never acted upon.A commitment under the law would have made it more difficult if not impossible for Nikolas Cruz to obtain a gun legally.Cruz is accused of the shooting rampage that killed 14 students and three school employees at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Feb. 14. In addition, 17 people were wounded.But more than a year earlier, documents in the criminal case against Nikolas Cruz and obtained by The Associated Press show school officials and a sheriff’s deputy recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation.The documents, which are part of Cruz’s criminal case in the shooting, show that he had written the word “kill” in a notebook, told a classmate that he wanted to buy a gun and use it, and had cut his arm supposedly in anger because he had broken up with a girlfriend. He also told another student he had drunk gasoline and was throwing up. Calls had even been made to the FBI about the possibility of Cruz using a gun at school.The documents were provided by a psychological assessment service initiated by Cruz’s mother called Henderson Behavioral Health. The documents show a high school resource officer who was also a sheriff’s deputy and two school counselors recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be committed for mental evaluation under Florida’s Baker Act. That law allows for involuntary commitment for mental health examination for at least three days.Such an involuntary commitment would also have been a high obstacle if not a complete barrier to legally obtaining a firearm, such as the AR-15 rifle used in the Stoneman Douglas massacre on Feb. 14, authorities say.There is no evidence Cruz was ever committed. Coincidentally, the school resource officer who recommended that Cruz be “Baker Acted” was Scot Peterson — the same Broward Sheriff’s Office deputy who resigned amid accusations he failed to respond to the shooting by staying outside the building where the killings occurred.David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor, said that an involuntary commitment would have been a huge red flag had Cruz attempted to buy a firearm legally.“If he had lied, hopefully the verification of the form would have pulled up the commitment paperwork,” Weinstein said.The documents do not say why Cruz was not committed under the Baker Act or whether he may not have qualified for other reasons. The law allows a law enforcement officer such as Peterson to initiate commitment under the Baker Act.An attorney for Peterson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Sunday.Cruz, 19, is charged in a 34-count indictment with killing 17 people and wounding 17 others in the attack. He faces the death penalty if convicted, but his public defender Melisa McNeill has said he would plead guilty in return for a life prison sentence.In the Henderson Behavioral Health documents, Cruz’s mother Lynda is quoted as saying she had fresh concerns about her son’s mental state after he punched holes in a wall at their home in Parkland. The clinicians at Henderson came to the home for interviews and said Cruz admitted punching the wall but said he did so because he was upset at a breakup with his girlfriend.Cruz also admitted cutting his arm with a pencil sharpener.After a Sept. 28, 2016 interview, the documents say Cruz “reports that he cut his arms 3-4 weeks ago and states that this is the only time he has ever cut. (Cruz) states that he cut because he was lonely, states that he had broken up with his girlfriend and reports that his grades had fallen. (Cruz) states that he is better now, reports that he is no longer lonely and states that his grades have gone back up.”He also told the clinician he owned only a pellet gun and was not capable of doing “serious harm” to anyone.The documents show that Cruz was very much on the radar screen of mental health professionals and the Broward County school system, yet very little appears to have been done other than these evaluations.Other red flags have also surfaced, including calls to the FBI about Cruz’s potential to become a school shooter and numerous visits by county law enforcement officials to his home – both before his mother died in November and after, when he lived briefly with a family friend in Palm Beach County.Again, very little was done.It’s not clear from the documents who the recommendation was forwarded to or why it was not followed up.___Follow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/MiamicurtMOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Ten years later, that number had increased to somewhere between $9.2 million and $36.5 million.One source of the windfall, according to a new book from Peter Schweizer, was a 2008 gift from Chao’s father, James Chao, for somewhere between $5 million and $25 million. But this gift could be seen as more than just a gift. It may have been acquired, according to Schweizer, thanks to the couple’s fealty to China, the source of the Chao family fortune. And that fealty may have occurred at the expense of the nation they had pledged to serve.…While politicians and their spouses are often subject to rigid regulations on what gifts they can accept and what sort of business they can conduct, others around them — like their friends or children have no such obstacles. So while a politician could theoretically wind up in prison for accepting $10,000 for doling out favors, establishing overseas connections that could land your children multi-million-dollar deals is harder to detect, and often legal.“Foreign governments and oligarchs like this form of corruption because it gives them private and unfettered gateways to the corridors of Washington power,” Schweizer writes. “Foreign entities cannot legally make campaign contributions, so using this approach creates an alternative way to curry favor and influence America’s political leaders. Simply camouflaging these transactions as business agreements provides another shield of plausible deniability.”As Schweizer tells it, the Chao family fortune derives from the Foremost Group, a shipping company that Chinese native James Chao, a classmate of former Chinese president Jiang Zemin at Jiao Tong University, founded in New York in 1964. Chao remains Foremost’s chairman today, and his daughters Angela and Christine are the company’s deputy chairwoman and general counsel, respectively. Elaine Chao worked there in the 1970s, and has been quoted as saying, “Shipping is our family tradition.”The success of Foremost is largely due to its close ties to the Chinese government, in particular the China State Shipbuilding Corp. (CSSC), a corporation with which Foremost has done “large volumes of business.”Read the rest of the story here.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/18/ap-kushner-companies-filed-false-documents-nyc/","NEW YORK (AP) — When the Kushner Cos. bought three apartment buildings in a gentrifying neighborhood of Queens in 2015, most of the tenants were protected by special rules that prevent developers from pushing them out, raising rents and turning a tidy profit.But that’s exactly what the company then run by Jared Kushner did, and with remarkable speed. Two years later, it sold all three buildings for $60 million, nearly 50 percent more than it paid.Now a clue has emerged as to how President Donald Trump’s son-in-law’s firm was able to move so fast: The Kushner Cos. routinely filed false paperwork with the city declaring it had zero rent-regulated tenants in dozens of buildings it owned across the city when, in fact, it had hundreds.While none of the documents during a three-year period when Kushner was CEO bore his personal signature, they provide a window into the ethics of the business empire he ran before he went on to become one of the most trusted advisers to the president of the United States.“It’s bare-faced greed,” said Aaron Carr, founder of Housing Rights Initiative, a tenants’ rights watchdog that compiled the work permit application documents and shared them with The Associated Press. “The fact that the company was falsifying all these applications with the government shows a sordid attempt to avert accountability and get a rapid return on its investment.”Kushner Cos. responded in a statement that it outsources the preparation of such documents to third parties that are reviewed by independent counsel, and “if mistakes or violations are identified, corrective action is taken immediately.”“Kushner would never deny any tenant their due-process rights,” it said, adding that the company “has renovated thousands of apartments and developments with minimal complaints over the past 30 years.”For the three Queens buildings in the borough’s Astoria neighborhood, the Kushner Cos. checked a box on construction permit applications in 2015 that indicated the buildings had zero rent-regulated tenants. Tax records filed a few months later showed the company inherited as many as 94 rent-regulated units from the previous owner.In all, Housing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos. filed at least 80 false applications for construction permits in 34 buildings across New York City from 2013 to 2016, all of them indicating there were no rent-regulated tenants. Instead, tax documents show there were more than 300 rent-regulated units. Nearly all the permit applications were signed by a Kushner employee, including sometimes the chief operating officer.Had the Kushner Cos. disclosed those rent-regulated tenants, it could have triggered stricter oversight of construction crews by the city, including possibly unscheduled “sweeps” on site by inspectors to keep the company from harassing tenants and getting them to leave.Instead, current and former tenants of the Queens buildings told the AP that they were subjected to extensive construction, with banging, drilling, dust and leaking water that they believe were part of targeted harassment to get them to leave and clear the way for higher-paying renters.“It was noisy, there were complaints, I got mice,” said mailman Rudolph Romano, adding that the Kushner Cos. tried to increase his rent by 60 percent. “They cleaned the place out. I watched the whole building leave.”Tax records show those rent-regulated units that numbered as many as 94 when Kushner took over fell to 25 by 2016.In Kushner buildings across the city, records show frequent complaints about construction going on early in the morning or late at night against the rules, improper or illegal construction, and work without a permit.At a six-story walk-up in Manhattan’s East Village that was once home to the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg, the Kushner Cos. filed an application to begin construction in late 2013 that, again, listed zero rent-regulated tenants. Tax records a few months later showed seven rent-regulated units.“All of a sudden, there was drilling, drilling. … You heard the drilling in the middle of night,” said one of the rent-regulated tenants, Mary Ann Siwek, 67, who lives on Social Security payments and odd jobs. “There were rats coming in from the abandoned building next door. The hallways were always filled with lumber and sawdust and plaster.”A knock on the door came a few weeks later, and an offer of at least $10,000 if she agreed to leave the building.“I know it’s pretty horrible, but we can help you get out,” Siwek recalls the man saying. “We can offer you money.”Siwek turned down the cash and sued instead. She said she won a year’s worth of free rent and a new refrigerator.New York City Council member Ritchie Torres, who plans to launch an investigation into permit applications, said: “The Kushners appear to be engaging in what I call the weaponization of construction.”Rent stabilization is a fixture of New York City that can bedevil developers seeking to make money off buildings. To free themselves of its restrictions, landlords usually have to wait until the rent rises above $2,733 a month, something that can take years given the small increases allowed each year.Submitting false documents to the city’s Department of Buildings for construction permits is a misdemeanor, which can carry fines of up to $25,000. But real estate experts say it is often flouted with little to no consequences. Landlords who do so get off with no more than a demand from the city, sometimes a year or more later, to file an “amended” form with the correct numbers.Housing Rights Initiative found the Kushner Cos. filed dozens of amended forms for the buildings mentioned in the documents, most of them a year to two later.“There is a lack of tools to go after landlords who harass tenants, and there is a lack of enforcement,” said Seth Miller, a real estate lawyer who used to work at a state housing agency overseeing rent regulations. Until officials inspect every construction site, “you’re going to have this incentive for landlords to make life uncomfortable for tenants.”New York City’s Department of Buildings declined to comment specifically on the Kushner documents but said it is ramping up its monitoring of construction, hiring 72 new inspectors and other staff under laws recently passed by the City Council to crack down on tenant harassment.“We won’t tolerate landlords who use construction to harass tenants — no matter who they are,” said spokesman Joseph Soldevere.Exactly how much money the Kushner Cos. earned from the buildings mentioned in the documents is unclear. Of those 34 buildings, only the three in Queens and a fourth in Brooklyn appear to have been sold. The company also likely made money by reducing the number of rent-regulated tenants and bringing in those who would pay more.Jared Kushner, who stepped down as CEO of the Kushner Cos. last year before taking on his advisory role at the White House, sold off part of his real estate holdings as required under government ethics rules. But he retained stakes in many properties, including Westminster Management, the Kushner Cos. subsidiary that oversees its residential properties. A financial disclosure last year showed he still owns a stake in Westminster and earned $1.6 million from the holding.Back in Queens, the mailman Romano was one of the few rent-regulated tenants who fought back.He hired a lawyer who found out he was protected from the Kushners’ 60 percent rent hike by law, something Romano did not know at the time. And his rent, which was set to increase to $3,750, was restored to $2,350.Romano is still in the building where he has lived for nine years, with his wife, four children and his guests from the construction days — the mice.“I still haven’t gotten rid of them.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/18/john-brennan-tweet-confirms-donald-trumps-concerns-politicized-intelligence/","Former CIA Director John Brennan reacted to the firing of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe — and President Donald Trump’s celebration of it — by tweeting a strident attack against Trump:When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history. You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America…America will triumph over you. https://t.co/uKppoDbduj— John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) March 17, 2018The president’s critics seem to like Brennan’s tweet. In fact, it confirmed what Trump has been saying all along: that the senior leadership of the intelligence and federal law enforcement services had become highly politicized.That impression was only reinforced further by a tweet from former UN Ambassador Samantha Power — whose full role in “unmasking” Americans who appeared in foreign intelligence wiretaps has yet to be exposed:Not a good idea to piss off John Brennan. https://t.co/VLg94OLL2R— Samantha Power (@SamanthaJPower) March 17, 2018Power’s warning echoes that of Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-NY), who warned Trump last January — in the midst of heavy leaks to the media by the FBI and intelligence services: “You take on the intelligence community — they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.”For these Democrats, it seemed natural to threaten the president with retaliation by the intelligence community. They showed no concern for the abuse of power that might entail.(By contrast, when evidence emerged in 2014 that the CIA had spied on staffers on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Republicans joined Democrats in condemning the agency’s behavior, calling it “treason.”)Power later tried to walk back her tweet:Whoa! Just home & see much misinterp. of earlier tweet. It’s testament to polarized times that it cd be misread as referring to something other than Brennan’s indignation. So will translate: not a good idea to upset @JohnBrennan bc/ he will raise an angry (& eloquent) voice. https://t.co/YgIjeKGAlp— Samantha Power (@SamanthaJPower) March 18, 2018Given her own role in “unmasking” American citizens. that revision may be less than convincing.In his own statement upon being fired, McCabe blasted the president for having “politicized” law enforcement, accusing him of trying “to taint the FBI, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals more generally.”Brennan’s public comments, McCabe’s leaks, and the whole sorry saga of Hillary Clinton’s non-investigation suggest that the politicization happened long before.Joel B.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-lawyers-mueller-russia-investigation.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s legal team was poised for a shake-up on Monday, according to two people briefed on the matter, as he openly discussed firing one of his lawyers, another considered resigning and a third — who pushed theories on television that Mr. Trump was framed by the F.B.I. — joined the roster.Mr. Trump has weighed aloud in recent days to close associates whether to dismiss his lawyer Ty Cobb, who had pushed most strongly a strategy of cooperating fully with the special counsel investigation. The president reassured Mr. Cobb that he had no plans to fire him, according to a person who spoke with the president late Monday, in part to prevent a narrative that his team was in disarray after The New York Times began making inquiries.Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer, John Dowd, has contemplated leaving his post because he has concluded that he has no control over the behavior of the president, the two people briefed on the matter said. Ignoring his lawyers’ advice, Mr. Trump has reverted to a more aggressive strategy of publicly assailing the inquiry that he initially adopted in the weeks immediately after the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was appointed. Now the president has begun attacking Mr. Mueller himself.The shift in tone appears to be a product of the president’s concern that the investigation into possible ties between his associates and Russia’s election interference is bearing down on him more directly. And the legal team’s collapse comes as his lawyers are confronting one of their most critical tasks: advising the president on whether to agree to sit for an interview with the special counsel’s office.Mr. Dowd said he had no plans to leave the team. “I’m sitting here working on the president’s case right now,” he said in a telephone interview on Monday night. Mr. Cobb has told people that the president has recently implored him to stay.In another sign of the president’s more aggressive posture, on Monday he hired Joseph E. diGenova, a longtime Washington lawyer who has appeared regularly on Fox News in recent months to claim that the F.B.I. and the Justice Department had manufactured evidence against Mr. Trump to aid Hillary Clinton.“There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he said on Fox News in January. He added, “Make no mistake about it: A group of F.B.I. and D.O.J. people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.”Little evidence has emerged to support that theory.Mr. Trump is also discussing adding other lawyers to the team, according to one person with knowledge of the matter.The tumult marked the greatest instability on the team since Mr. Trump pushed aside his personal lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, last summer, and was passed over by many of Washington’s top lawyers before he settled on his current crop of attorneys.“It’s never a good idea to see legal teams change dramatically and for competent lawyers to be replaced by others,” said Roger Cossack, a longtime legal analyst. “It shows that there is chaos and that whoever the client is — in this case the president — is unhappy and is searching for the magic bullet. And it’s never a great strategy to search for the magic bullet. The president clearly wants it to end and wants to put an end to it.”Mr. Cobb, Mr. Dowd and another lawyer, Jay Sekulow, took over last summer from Mr. Kasowitz, a feisty New Yorker who had represented Mr. Trump in high-profile lawsuits and urged an aggressive posture toward Mr. Mueller, who was appointed last May.Mr. Trump insisted to his lawyers that he did nothing wrong and they pushed for cooperation with the special counsel, arguing it was his best way to have his name cleared. Working inside the White House, Mr. Cobb oversaw the production of thousands of pages of documents and emails that were turned over to Mr. Mueller’s office and said that the president should not assert executive privilege over the records to keep from slowing the process. The lawyers told the president they hoped to get Mr. Mueller to acknowledge by the end of the year that Mr. Trump was not a target of the investigation.Mr. Mueller’s investigation is continuing.As it goes forward, Mr. Trump has questioned his lawyers’ approach and clashed with them about whether to be interviewed by Mr. Mueller. The president believes he is his best spokesman and can explain to Mr. Mueller that he did nothing wrong. The lawyers see little upside.Mr. Dowd and Mr. Sekulow became concerned about their standing with the president in the past two weeks after they learned Mr. Trump had met with another veteran lawyer, Emmet Flood, who represented President Bill Clinton during impeachment proceedings, about joining the team.Both publicly and privately, Mr. Trump tried to reassure his lawyers that they had not fallen out of favor with him. “I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter, assailing a New York Times article about his discussions with Mr. Flood. “They are doing a great job.”Mr. Dowd, in turn, called on the Justice Department over the weekend to end the special counsel investigation. Mr. Dowd said at first that he was speaking for the president, but later backtracked. But according to two people briefed on the matter, he was in fact acting at the president’s urging.Mr. Dowd’s statement set off a stream of negative coverage of Mr. Trump on cable television, to which he is closely attuned. His lawyers were criticized for being undisciplined, and Mr. Dowd’s remarks prompted concern that the president was going to order that Mr. Mueller be fired. Mr. Cobb tried to douse that speculation on Sunday, saying that the president was not considering dismissing the special counsel.The president’s newest lawyer, Mr. diGenova, has worked in Washington legal circles for decades, including as a United States attorney for the District of Columbia appointed by President Ronald Reagan. He has served as an independent counsel in government waste, fraud and abuse investigations, notably a three-year criminal inquiry into whether officials in the George Bush administration broke any laws in their search for damaging information about Bill Clinton, then a presidential candidate.Mr. diGenova is law partners with his wife, Victoria Toensing. She has also represented Sam Clovis, the former Trump campaign co-chairman, and Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor Blackwater and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Prince also attended a meeting in January 2017 with a Russian investor in the Seychelles that the special counsel is investigating.Ms. Toensing also represents Mark Corallo, the former spokesman for the Trump legal team who has accused one of the president’s advisers of potentially planning to obstruct justice with a statement related to a 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information about Mrs. Clinton.Mr. diGenova was one of several former independent counsels who, in the late 1990s, argued that the role be narrowed. In 1999, Congress let the portions of the law allowing for an independent counsel expire.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-new-hampshire-opioid-plan.html","MANCHESTER, N.H. — President Trump made his first visit to New Hampshire since the 2016 campaign on Monday, unveiling a plan to combat the opioid epidemic that includes a push for the death penalty for drug dealers and a crackdown on illegal immigrants.Mr. Trump spoke in a state with the nation’s third-highest rate of deaths from overdoses and where opioids are a potent political issue. In a speech at a community college here, he offered up more tough talk than he did specifics about his plan, or how he would pay for it.The president said that most of the heroin in the country comes in from the southern border, “where eventually the Democrats will agree with us and build the wall to keep the damn drugs out”; he denounced so-called sanctuary cities, which he blamed for an uptick in overdoses; and he called for harsher penalties for drug dealers.“If we don’t get tougher on drug dealers, we are wasting our time,” Mr. Trump said, later adding, “That toughness includes the death penalty” — a position that was at odds with what White House officials told reporters on Sunday.The president said that he had spoken to leaders of Asian countries “where they don’t play games,” an apparent reference to conversations he has described having with President Xi Jinping of China and President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines, who told him that the death penalties in their countries meant there was less of a drug problem.White House officials would not answer what type of hypothetical case would involve the death penalty, referring questions to the Justice Department.Mr. Trump also urged Congress to lower the threshold to use mandatory minimum sentences on opioid dealers, and said he will look for tougher criminal sentences on traffickers of certain drugs, such as fentanyl. He brought a series of people to the podium, including an ICE agent and parents whose eldest son died of a fentanyl overdose, to tell their stories.The plan the president described, which was based on recommendations by an opioid commission the president appointed last year, has the goal of reducing the supply of illicit drugs with better interdiction and tougher penalties, reducing opioid prescriptions and overall demand for opioids, and expanding access to treatment and recovery tools like the overdose-reversing drug naloxone.The plan seeks to cut the number of opioid prescriptions filled by a third within three years, a restriction that will face opposition from critics who argue it could have unintended consequences for people with chronic and even acute pain, and that it instead could force some users to seek more dangerous drugs, like heroin and synthetic fentanyl.Officials were vague about how the prescriptions would be reduced, saying only that a main goal would be for prescribers for Medicaid, Medicare and other federal health programs to follow guidelines that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published two years ago. Those guidelines recommended that doctors first try ibuprofen and aspirin to treat pain, and that opioid treatment for short-term pain last no more than a week.The plan says little about how addiction treatment would be expanded besides a vague goal of expanding access to “evidence-based addiction treatment” in every state, particularly for members of the military, for veterans and their families and for people leaving jail or prison.Drug overdoses killed roughly 64,000 people in the United States in 2016, according to initial estimates from the C.D.C., and have become the leading cause of death for Americans under 50.Mr. Trump has declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency and in his budget plan last month proposed spending $10 billion on the epidemic over the next two fiscal years. But he did not put a specific price tag on the plan’s cost. Congress recently allotted $6 billion to address the epidemic over the next two years, which public health experts have described as a good start but not anywhere near enough.The president also called for repealing the Affordable Care Act, which expanded Medicaid to cover much of the addiction treatment provided around the United States over the past few years.In his State of the State address last month, Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican who was on hand for the president’s speech, called the opioid crisis the state’s “most serious challenge.”Voters have agreed, with 53 percent saying in a Granite State poll last year that drugs were the biggest problem facing the state — the first time in the poll’s history that a majority labeled a single issue the most important.Mr. Trump’s push for the death penalty for drug traffickers could play well with voters here, as New Hampshire is the only state in New England that still allows capital punishment, though it has not executed anyone since 1939.In statements after Mr. Trump’s speech, the state’s two Democratic senators — Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan — said they generally supported many of Mr. Trump’s proposals. Neither senator’s statement directly addressed the president’s call for the death penalty for traffickers, but Ms. Hassan’s aides said that in comments earlier in the day, she had opposed the death penalty for traffickers.“I think it reflects a lack of a broader understanding of the factors in this crisis,” Ms. Hassan told Fosters.com, a news site. “We have to go after demand as well as supply, and law enforcement have been the first people to tell us we can’t enforce our way out of this.”Asked for clarification of her view on Monday, Ms. Shaheen — who, when she was governor of New Hampshire in 2000, vetoed a bill that would have repealed the state’s death penalty — said through her spokeswoman: “Frankly, whether a drug dealer, after exhausting all of their legal appeals, gets the death penalty 20 years from now has no impact on our immediate crisis.”She said Mr. Trump should be providing more money for the police, emergency medical workers and families in need of treatment.Civil liberties lawyers were highly critical of Mr. Trump’s endorsement of the death penalty for traffickers and said it would be unworkable.“There has never been an execution under the one part of United States law that allows the death penalty as a punishment for traffickers,” said Ames Grawert, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York. “The Supreme Court has consistently refused to sanction the use of the death penalty in crimes other than homicide.”
                Maggie Haberman reported from Manchester, N.H., Abby Goodnough from Washington, and Katharine Q. Seelye from Boston.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/trump-tweets-comey-mccabe.html","WASHINGTON — Usually, top intelligence and law enforcement officials withdraw to lives of tight-lipped relative anonymity after their careers end. (Suffice it to say, they are not exactly known for viral Twitter battles.)But as President Trump has voiced his grievances against the F.B.I. with a series of insult-laden tweets, his targets have responded nearly in kind, turning a conflict that would in the past have stayed behind closed doors into a brawl for all to see.Throughout the weekend, the president attacked “lying James Comey,” the F.B.I. director he fired last year.He also celebrated the dismissal of Mr. Comey’s onetime deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, calling it on Friday “a great day for Democracy.”Mr. Comey struck back on the president’s preferred digital soapbox. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon,” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday, in what was most likely a reference to his coming book. “And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not.”Mr. McCabe, through his lawyer, tweeted a similar message, though with a biting flourish. “We will not be responding to each childish, defamatory, disgusting & false tweet by the President,” said the lawyer, Michael R. Bromwich. “The whole truth will come out in due course.”Other former officials who have been the subject of the president’s taunts have also had choice words for him on Twitter. John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director who now refers to himself as “a nonpartisan American who is very concerned about our collective future,” attacked the president’s character on Saturday.“When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude, and political corruption becomes known, you will take your rightful place as a disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history,” wrote Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Trump once called “one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.” “You may scapegoat Andy McCabe, but you will not destroy America...America will triumph over you.”Throughout history, presidents have found themselves in private conflict with members of law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Bill Clinton clashed with Louis J. Freeh, who oversaw the F.B.I. during the Lewinsky scandal. Richard M. Nixon fired the independent special prosecutor in the “Saturday Night Massacre,” and his attorney general and deputy attorney general resigned in protest.But those tense interactions, experts say, seem almost quaint compared to the public mudslinging unfolding now.“We’ve never had anybody so blatantly go after a president before,” Gary J. Schmitt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who was once an intelligence adviser to President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview. “It’s also unprecedented to have a president so overtly going after various intelligence officials.”He added, “It’s a race to the bottom.”The president, who has no qualms about publicly attacking individuals as well as institutions, has grown only more frustrated as the investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia continues well beyond the timeline given to him by his lawyers. On Saturday, one of them, John Dowd, said that he thought the investigation was baseless and should end.The president followed up with a pair of Twitter posts singling out the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, for the first time.“Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!” Mr. Trump wrote.The White House did not respond to questions about the former officials’ criticism of the president, but Mr. Trump’s outrage spoke for itself. He kept lobbing tweet-size insults until Sunday morning, when he left the White House for a round of golf.In one, he took aim at news that Mr. McCabe, who was one of the first officials at the F.B.I. to look into possible Russian ties to the Trump team, had kept contemporaneous memos about his interactions with the president. (Mr. Comey also kept memos.)“Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?”Jeremy Bash, who served as chief of staff to Leon E. Panetta in his roles as C.I.A. director and defense secretary during the Obama administration, said in an interview that current and former officials were alarmed to see a president so intent on eroding the public’s trust in the F.B.I. They are keenly aware, Mr. Bash said, that Mr. Trump’s insults have a way of making it to TV, and vice versa.“It seems to be a very short distance between the president’s Twitter device and the megaphone of Fox News and other allies on Capitol Hill,” Mr. Bash said. “I think most professionals I speak with think he will ultimately fail, but they worry we are a few Fox News segments away from more and more people in that conspiracy theory echo chamber.”Some experts question the decision of Mr. Comey and others to publicly hit back at the president. Mike German, a former F.B.I. agent who is now at the Brennan Center, a public policy and law institute, said the public exchanges were further proof of an eroding of trust between the head of the executive branch and its traditionally apolitical civil servants.He said the former officials’ willingness to speak out against the president could spell problems for Mr. Mueller.“I would imagine from Bob Mueller’s point of view having potential witnesses tweeting back and forth with the president is the last thing you want,” Mr. German said. “The credibility of everyone involved is being torn to tatters in broad daylight.”Vicki Divoll, a former general counsel for the Senate Intelligence Committee and a former assistant general counsel for the C.I.A., said remarks by former officials like Mr. Comey and Mr. Brennan reflected a larger frustration that others, including Republican members of Congress, were not speaking out against transgressions that would have felled other politicians.“Comey and Brennan are perfect examples who do not seek the limelight,” Ms. Divoll said, “who do not do anything but speak publicly and privately in very measured ways. But the gloves are off. That’s not happening anymore.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/us/politics/mnuchin-trump-tariffs-g20-meeting.html","BUENOS AIRES — President Trump’s plan to hit countries around the world with stiff tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum has dominated a gathering of world economic leaders amid fears that the United States is on the cusp of starting an international trade war.On Monday, Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, was peppered with requests from several countries for exemptions from the tariffs, which are being imposed in the name of national security. In a series of what Mr. Mnuchin called “direct” conversations with leaders here for the Group of 20 finance ministers meeting, the Treasury secretary defended Mr. Trump’s “America First” economic policies, while trying to soothe his counterparts’ concerns.In an interview on the sidelines of the meeting, Mr. Mnuchin suggested exemptions to the tariffs could be announced “relatively quickly.”“I think we’ve been very transparent in describing our positions; I don’t think anything should be a surprise,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “This is all about free and fair and reciprocal trade.”Mr. Trump has already said he would exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs upon a successful renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he has indicated that other countries could also get exemptions. But the United States has yet to detail what would qualify a country for an exemption, other than a vague reference to protecting the United States’ national security and reducing bilateral trade deficits.Trump administration officials have said that the tariffs are aimed primarily at combating cheap metals from China, which they say are flooding into the United States through other countries. The Commerce Department has ruled that those imports pose a threat to national security because they degrade the United States industrial base.Countries including France, Argentina and South Korea pressed Mr. Mnuchin on Monday about being freed from the metals tariffs, arguing that, as United States allies, they should not be penalized on national security grounds. Mr. Mnuchin said that decisions were being made on a case-by-case basis and that there was not a one-size-fits-all approach to deciding which countries would be exempt. The tariffs go into effect on Friday.Mr. Mnuchin said he was confident that the United States was acting in compliance with the World Trade Organization, and argued that the Trump administration was not trying to start a trade war.“I think we have the right combination here of doing something to protect U.S. industry from dumping and unfair competition in the appropriate way,” he said. “The objective is not to put tariffs on everybody but to solve the issue.”But many are fearful that steel and aluminum tariffs are just the beginning of a broader effort to erect trade barriers that could upend a globally integrated economy.The Trump administration is expected to announce at least $30 billion in new tariffs on China this week, and tensions between the two economic superpowers are on the rise. David Malpass, Treasury’s under secretary for international affairs, said at a forum here on Sunday that China was reversing decades of progress in liberalizing its economy and that formal economic discussions between the two countries, known as the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, had stalled as a result.Mr. Mnuchin declined to comment on the coming China tariffs but said he made his concerns about the United States’ access to the Asian nation’s market known to his Chinese counterpart at the G-20.“We’re having very direct discussions with China about reciprocal trade, discussed this morning about market reforms in China,” Mr. Mnuchin said. “We look forward to them hopefully moving in that fashion.”While Mr. Mnuchin said that other countries had started to adapt to the United States’ new trade policy, it was evident in Argentina that anxiety levels were high.Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, said Monday that he told Mr. Mnuchin that the entire European Union must be exempt from the steel and aluminum tariffs. In what he characterized as a “frank” discussion, Mr. Le Maire warned that time is running out to reach an agreement and that bilateral negotiations with European countries on the matter were not acceptable. Mr. Trump detests multilateral negotiations and that has been a sticking point with the United States when embarking on trade talks.“We are waiting for the United States to show some good will towards Europe,” Mr. Le Maire said, adding that while France agrees that China’s steel overcapacity is a global concern, a trade war is not the answer. “Going the way of protectionism will lead nowhere.”He added, “It will make only losers, not winners, including the United States.”Before the meeting, Olaf Scholz, Germany’s finance minister, also sounded an alarm. “I am seriously concerned that the foundation of our prosperity — free trade — is being put at risk,” he told the German newspaper Bild.At the G-20, concerns about rising trade barriers muted enthusiasm about the recent run of strong economic growth around the world. The International Monetary Fund listed in a report prepared before the meetings that “inward-looking policies” could pose a risk to the global economy. Timothy D. Adams, the president of the Institute of International Finance, warned that a trend toward “de-globalization” could harm consumers.“Protectionism is creeping and seeping in all corners of the economy,” Mr. Adams said.The Trump administration’s trade agenda is provoking consternation among veterans of previous administrations, who lament the United States’ abdication as a vocal promoter of the gains from free and open markets.“We worked very hard to drive the agenda toward having open markets, free trade, inclusive growth and not interfering in currency in an unfair way,” Jack Lew, who served as Treasury secretary under President Barack Obama, said in an interview this month. “I don’t know if that’s where the U.S. is pressing the G-20 to go right now. It doesn’t seem to be.”Desmond Lachman, a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute and a former deputy director for policy at the International Monetary Fund, said it was remarkable to see the United States adopting an isolationist policy.“The Europeans are furious with what the U.S. is doing,” Mr. Lachman said. “For 70 years, the United States has been the leader in the call for open markets and global markets. Now they are in the opposite position.”Supporters of Mr. Trump, however, have cheered Mr. Mnuchin’s approach to China on steel and intellectual property.“It is a bit rambunctious for the Trump administration to approach the issue this way, but it’s certainly more effective than continuing the polite conversations that have been avoiding the real challenges for some time now,” said Scott Paul, the president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing. The group is among those supporting the tariffs, seeing them as a way to protect United States manufacturers against the forces of global trade.In the interview on Monday, Mr. Mnuchin was unapologetic about Mr. Trump’s tariffs and insisted that the United States was merely responding to unfair trade practices of others countries.“We’re not going to be afraid to defend our trade positions,” he said. “We don’t want to get into trade wars, but we also want to protect U.S. companies and U.S. rights and have free and fair trade.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/us/politics/education-secretary-devos-reorganization-plan-union.html","WASHINGTON — Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will go before a House panel on Tuesday to defend her agency’s budget, including a sweeping overhaul of the Education Department that has strained relations within her agency and with Congress — and defies the White House’s budget office.In recent weeks, Ms. DeVos has clashed fiercely with department staff members over the plan, which they say she tried to withhold from Congress as she imposed on the department what they call an illegal collective bargaining agreement.Ms. DeVos will testify before the House Appropriations Committee, whose staff was told a week ago that her office had withheld vital information from it regarding the department’s budget for the fiscal year that begins in October. The budget request calls for a 5 percent spending cut, eliminates dozens of programs and pitches a $1 billion school choice proposal. It also includes a shake-up of several divisions that is already underway.A career department official unveiled details of Ms. DeVos’s “Education Reform Plan” in an email to staff members on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The email, obtained by The Times, said information driving budget decisions was omitted from budget justifications submitted to Congress.“Our concern is about a breakdown in communication, a culture of secrecy and a fear of retaliatory action that has prevented Budget Service from providing House and Senate appropriators and staff, and for that matter, the public, with key information about the department’s plans for fiscal year 2019,” the email said. “Given the potential for some of these proposals to radically impact the way the department carries out its mission, Congress should probably see this.”Among the proposals outlined in the 56-page plan, obtained by The Times, was the consolidation of a number of administrative offices, cutting the number of regional offices in the Office for Civil Rights and acquiring several programs run by the Department of Labor.Department officials said they have since abandoned the civil rights proposals, which were sure to be the most controversial part of the plan. They said the plan remained in flux. It was created last fall to comply with President Trump’s executive order to curb the reach of federal agencies and cut duplication and inefficiency.Liz Hill, the Education Department spokeswoman, said that it was “absolutely not true” that the department intentionally withheld details from Congress, and that “no final determinations have been made and therefore there is nothing to present.”“The deliberative reorganization document is just that — a deliberative document not in final form,” she said. “We are following normal protocols for department reorganization.”Though the plan presents a long-term vision, through 2022, some of its contents were presented in a 14-page presentation to employees in February shortly after the department’s budget requests were released. And last week, the department announced it would reassign its budget director, the first move toward disbanding the budget office. The decision was made over the opposition of the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, according to Politico. Several other staff changes were announced for 2019.Some department employees denounced the move as an effort to dismantle an agency that would provide a critical check on the department’s overhaul plans, but other experts said it made sense.“Budget offices, because they have so much power and institutional knowledge, can be seen as obstacles by reform-minded government leaders,” said Andy Smarick, a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. “Many new government officials think they’ll only have to fight policy battles, when in fact there are lots of ways, including in the budget process, for their efforts to get scuttled.”The plan aligns with measures Ms. DeVos has taken to shrink her agency, which she has described as bloated. She has shed hundreds of regulations, and hundreds of staff through attrition and buyouts.For the most part, Ms. DeVos’s restructuring plan involves consolidating offices, such as merging the office that oversees charter and private schools with the main office that oversees elementary and secondary education in public schools. The plan would eliminate the Office of the Under Secretary, a position that has helped shape higher education policy, and create a new Office of Lifelong Learning. It would also reduce the number of political appointees.The proposal also seeks to acquire several programs run by the Department of Labor. The department proposed to take over adult and unemployed worker programs run by the Labor Department, and to redirect the funding for those programs to federal Pell grants so that unemployed workers can enroll in higher education and vocational programs. The department would acquire an “out-of-school youth” program from the Labor Department, as well as a program that helps reintegrate ex-prisoners.Details of the plan surfaced amid a bitter contract dispute between the DeVos administration and the union that represents the department’s 3,900 employees. Union leaders believe the contract gutted all protections that would allow its members to defend themselves in the department’s overhaul.Most notably, the contract cuts down the use of “official time,” which employees could use to do union activities, a benefit Congress extended 40 years ago, and instead requires that representatives take unpaid leave for such activities with permission from their supervisors.The goal of the collective bargaining agreement, Ms. Hill said, “is to treat all employees and the American taxpayers fairly.”Union officials say the agreement also stripped out previously negotiated provisions for pay increases and promotions, performance evaluations, work schedules, child care and overtime. It also limits the issues that can be brought up as a grievance and eliminates a guarantee against retaliation for filing one.“This agency contends that their mission is so very important, but how can it be when they’re creating a hostile work environment, where employees are coming and going and worried about what’s going to happen to them on a daily basis?” said Sharon Harris, executive vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Council 252, which represents Education Department employees.The union said the agreement came “after months of anti-union proposals and hostile behavior at the table,” which concluded with the department’s bargaining team effectively walking away from negotiations before they even started.The department said the union failed to negotiate in good faith, ignoring multiple invitations to resolve the impasse and blowing multiple deadlines to submit counteroffers. The department imposed its final offer.The fight speaks to a larger theme at the department, the employee wrote to congressional staffers.“Things have gotten pretty awful here,” said the email from the Education Department official, which noted that the department would start requiring screening of all communication with Congress. “And at this point, employees are willing to accept whatever fallout comes with exercising a right to make sure Congress gets information it needs. Employees are tired of seeing their colleagues deputized into misleading Congress.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/business/economy/economy-recovery.html","Americans have spent much of the past decade wondering when the economy would recover from the crippling Great Recession. Now, they are considering another question: When, and how, will that recovery end?This month is the 10th anniversary of the collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns, the first stirrings of what became a global financial crisis. Next month, in another milestone, the current recovery will become the second-longest American economic expansion on record.There is no sign that the rebound will end anytime soon. Unemployment is low, job creation is strong and the overall economy seems to be gaining momentum, not losing it. Most economists expect the expansion to continue well into next year, which would make it the longest ever. Many think it could last for years, raising the possibility that President Trump could run for re-election amid the most sustained economic growth in a generation.Even the Federal Reserve’s intention to impose three interest-rate increases this year — with the first expected on Wednesday — has done little to cloud the outlook.But many economists also argue that the seeds of the next crisis are being sown today, even if it is several years before they poke above the surface. Good times are meant to give governments an opportunity to get their fiscal houses in order and address long-term challenges. Instead, the United States is piling on debt and adopting policies — immigration restrictions, increased trade barriers, looser financial regulation — that many economists view as counterproductive.“We’re adding to the structural issues,” said Veronique de Rugy, an economist at the Mercatus Center, a libertarian think tank. “This is the thing that’s the most disconcerting. We’re not just not addressing it, we’re adding to it.”Investors may be starting to worry about whether the recovery could be, if not ending, at least entering a riskier phase. In February, markets tumbled after a report showing unexpectedly strong wage growth revived long-dormant fears of inflation. The markets rebounded but have remained volatile, dropping again this month when Mr. Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum that are expected to take effect this week.Economists said that any fears investors have would not be unfounded, but might be premature. It is possible that the tightening labor market — the unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is the lowest since 2000 — could force companies to pay higher wages. That could lead to inflation and prompt the Fed to raise rates more quickly than planned, and the tighter credit for businesses and consumers could cause a recession.The likelihood of such a chain of events may have increased in recent months with the Republican tax bill’s passage and the adoption of a big spending package in Congress, which together could pour hundreds of billions of dollars in fiscal stimulus into the economy. Mr. Trump’s tariffs could also increase consumer prices by limiting cheaper imports from abroad.“We already had a tight economy, and then you add fiscal stimulus, and then you add on top of that trade protections,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank. “It’s close to the perfect storm coming together with these risks of overheating.”So far, the threat remains hypothetical. Inflation has crept up but remains below the Fed’s 2 percent target, and wage growth remains anemic — even the surprising figure for January was later revised down. If inflation does pick up, it will not result in a recession overnight.The impact of a potential trade war is harder to assess. The tariffs announced by Mr. Trump so far are small and unlikely to have much effect on the overall economy. But if he pursues broad-based tariffs against China — something he is reportedly considering — and prompts retaliation by the European Union or other trading partners, the consequences could be much greater.“We know from history that’s lose-lose,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a pro-trade think tank. “It reverberates throughout the U.S. economy.”Beyond the issue of trade, most experts see few threats likely to derail the recovery in the short term. That is partly because it would take a fairly substantial shock to knock the economy off course. Tax cuts and spending increases may raise the specter of inflation, but they also provide extra insulation against such a shock. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal recently put the odds of a recession in the next year at 14 percent.“I think we’re going to go gangbusters for the rest of this year,” said Martin N. Baily, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton and is now an economist at the Brookings Institution.Economists are famously terrible at predicting recessions. Few saw the last one coming. And although the current expansion has been durable, it has not been particularly strong. Quarterly annualized growth in gross domestic product has averaged just 2.2 percent since the recession ended, compared with 5 percent for the typical recovery since 1950. The economy has basically experienced a long smolder rather than the kind of rapid conflagration common in the past.“You can look at it with time as your metric and say, ‘Wow, this is really long,’” said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist for Credit Suisse. “Or you can look at output and say, ‘It’s actually surprisingly weak.’”Some parts of the country have experienced little recovery at all. And many families are still earning far less than they were before the recession. As a result, some economists, especially on the left, argue that policymakers should be less worried about the economy overheating than about the recovery ending too soon.“You just see a pervasive attitude in markets that says, ‘Oh, no, workers are starting to get a piece of the pie, time to take it away,’” said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, said there was evidence that the economy could keep growing without faster inflation. Even a little more inflation, Mr. Summers said, would not necessarily be a bad thing.“A strong, fully employed economy — where firms looking for workers is a larger issue than workers looking for firms — is the best social program we know,” he said. “It is shortages of labor that induce firms to figure out how to train felons, to move beyond their traditional prejudices, to figure out how to skill unskilled workers, to reach into distressed or depressed communities.”That argument puts economists like Mr. Summers and Mr. Bernstein in odd political company. Mr. Trump’s economic advisers — including the incoming head of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow — have played down the threat of inflation, and Mr. Trump has indicated in the past that he would like the Fed to keep interest rates low. That could pay electoral dividends: If the Fed allows the economy to accelerate, it could bolster Mr. Trump’s re-election chances, even if it raises the risk of a recession in his second term.So far, the Fed does not seem inclined to cooperate. Jerome H. Powell, the newly appointed Fed chairman, has said he plans to continue the policy of gradual rate increases adopted by his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen. But Mr. Powell hinted in recent congressional testimony that the central bank could be forced to move more quickly if the economy continued to gain strength.“Some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,” Mr. Powell told lawmakers last month.In any case, research has found that economic expansions do not “die of old age.” Rather, they end because something — a policy mistake, an asset bubble, an outside shock — causes them to.Nellie Liang, who led the Fed’s financial stability efforts after the financial crisis, said the United States had stayed out of trouble since then partly because regulators learned lessons that made banks and other financial institutions far stronger.But Ms. Liang said that after years of low interest rates and steady gains, investors could be caught off guard when the economy hits a speed bump.“Recessions don’t have to come every 10 years or so,” Ms. Liang said. But avoiding them, she added, required vigilance.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/us-south-korea-joint-military-exercises.html","WASHINGTON — The United States and South Korea will resume their annual joint military exercises on April 1, the Pentagon announced Monday, restarting drills that have aroused the ire of North Korea and were suspended during the Olympics and Paralympics.Washington and Seoul had agreed to delay the drills after South and North Korea announced they were beginning a diplomatic rapprochement, with the North sending a delegation to the Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.The exercises, code-named Foal Eagle and Key Resolve, will involve some 23,000 American troops and more than 300,000 South Korean troops. The scale this year is similar to that of previous years, Defense Department officials said.South Korean officials have told reporters that North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, who is expected to meet with President Trump by May about the North’s nuclear program, has appeared unexpectedly flexible about the exercises this year. During previous drills, Mr. Kim has conducted multiple missile tests.But during talks with South Korean envoys early this month, Mr. Kim said that “he could understand why the joint exercises must resume in April on the same scale as before,” Chung Eui-yong, South Korea’s national security adviser, said this month.Choi Hyun-soo, a spokeswoman for South Korea’s Ministry of National Defense, said the North Korean military was notified on Tuesday of the schedule and “defensive nature” of the drills. Such notices are delivered through Panmunjom, a contact point established on the North-South border when the Korean War was halted in a truce in 1953.The drills are always high profile, largely because the United States and South Korea seek to use them as a statement of unity and purpose in the defense of South Korea against the North. Because of that, the exercises always seem to anger North Korea.“Our combined exercises are defense-oriented, and there is no reason for North Korea to view them as provocation,” said Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. “These routine training exercises are not conducted in response to any D.P.R.K. provocations or the current political situation on the peninsula,” he added, using the abbreviation for the North’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.This year, the exercises are bound to be even more delicate, as the Trump administration rushes to prepare for first-of-their-kind talks between an American president and a North Korean leader.White House officials are scrambling to figure out how Mr. Trump will handle the negotiations, which will pose a stiff challenge to an administration that has built its North Korea policy around imposing crippling sanctions, backed by the threat of military action. Before the announcement of talks this month, there had been little planning for how a negotiation between Washington and Pyongyang would unfold.The South Korean and United States militaries usually hold the exercises from late February through April.The Key Resolve exercise is largely a computer-simulated war game, while Foal Eagle has typically involved large-scale ground, air, naval and special operations field exercises, including amphibious-landing drills.The allied militaries did not immediately reveal when the exercises would end or whether any American aircraft carriers would participate, as they have in the past.The South Korean news media has speculated that this year’s drills will be shortened, ending before Mr. Kim and President Moon Jae-in are scheduled to hold their summit meeting in late April. Mr. Trump has agreed to meet with Mr. Kim by May.At the height of the tensions between North Korea and the United States last year, the United States frequently dispatched strategic bombers on training missions over the peninsula, along with what Mr. Trump called an “armada” of aircraft carriers and other warships to surrounding waters, as part of Washington’s “maximum” pressure campaign.The announcement about the exercises came as a senior North Korean official started unofficial talks with a delegation of former United States and South Korean officials in Finland. North Korean officials have held such informal talks periodically with former officials and scholars.Washington said that the American participants, including Kathleen Stephens, the former ambassador to South Korea, were not representing the United States government. But this year’s meeting drew unusual attention because of its timing before the anticipated meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/representative-louise-slaughter-house.html","WASHINGTON — As House members raced to the exits for an overdue summer break in August 2007, I bumped into Representative Louise M. Slaughter in the Capitol Rotunda. I asked if she had big recess plans to wind down from her hectic first months as chairwoman of the Rules Committee after the Democratic takeover of the House that January.“Well, Carl,” she said with a sigh, “I’m having a colonoscopy Monday, and you know what the preparation for that is like.”As that offhand remark illustrates, Ms. Slaughter did not hold much back from either a personal or a political standpoint. Her death last week at 88 after a fall at her home in Washington cost Congress one of its unique personalities — a rare lawmaker who was respected, admired and held in great affection by members of both parties even as she served in one of the most partisan positions in the House.Known universally to her colleagues simply as Louise, Ms. Slaughter was a remarkable figure in many ways. She was a trailblazer for women when entering politics was difficult and male counterparts could treat them with disdain and disrespect. She was a revered champion of women’s rights. She was also recognizable for the lilt of her native Kentucky accent but still managed to get elected to her Rochester-centered district in upstate New York 16 times — a formidable achievement.She was a tenacious legislator. But one characteristic that distinguished her from many in the current polarized environment is that while she might strenuously differ with her opponents, she didn’t hold them in contempt or dismiss them out of hand. She fulfilled the old political maxim of being able to disagree without being disagreeable.“Really, the thing that I keep coming back to is how she was tough, but unfailingly gracious,” said Speaker Paul D. Ryan as he ordered the flags at the Capitol to be lowered to half-staff in tribute to Ms. Slaughter, the only woman to lead the Rules Committee. “She was simply great.”That is not how speakers of one party typically talk about one of their chief adversaries in the other, even in times of grief. But Ms. Slaughter, whose funeral is set for Friday in Rochester, had earned it.“We have some very divisive battles in the Rules Committee, but I think she genuinely liked and appreciated everyone on that committee,” said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts, who served alongside Ms. Slaughter on the panel for 17 years. “We’d have these big fights and she would be asking someone, ‘How’s your son, your father, your mother?’ and tell them to try her homemade cures.”“But when the gavel went down, she was a fighter,” said Mr. McGovern, who would have been remiss had he not mentioned Ms. Slaughter regularly showing up with home-baked pies. “She had this talent where she was determined and forceful, but she also had a sense of humor and knew how to charm people and get her point across. She was very, very effective.”Tensions can run high at meetings of the Rules Committee, one of the original committees of the House and the forum where the majority party gets to exercise its muscle in setting the parameters of floor debate.With its 9-to-4 membership breakdown, it is heavily weighted toward the majority, and the minority can often get angry and frustrated as majority lawmakers essentially fix the debate to their advantage. It often meets at odd hours and in rushed circumstances, exacerbating the partisan sniping. Both as chairwoman and the top member of the minority, Ms. Slaughter found ways to keep things on an even keel.“She was a force to be reckoned with who always brought her spunk, fire and dynamic leadership to every meeting,” said Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas, who now leads the panel and jousted with Ms. Slaughter for years. “Louise was a fearless leader, deeply committed to her constituents, and a dear friend.” He added that he would always “cherish our friendship, camaraderie and, of course, her rhubarb pie.”Perhaps Ms. Slaughter’s biggest moment in the limelight was during House machinations over the health care bill in 2010. The loss of a crucial 60th vote in the Senate with the death of Edward M. Kennedy had handcuffed House Democrats who had no choice but to pass a Senate bill with some provisions they didn’t like if they wanted to send a bill to the White House. To limit the political pain, Democrats cooked up an approach that would have essentially deemed the bill passed under what is known in Congress as a self-executing rule, allowing Democrats to avoid a direct vote on those objectionable provisions.Though Republicans had done the same thing in the past, they howled and mocked Ms. Slaughter with catchy phrases such as “Slaughter House Rules.” Democrats eventually came up with another approach, but Republicans continued to complain, leading the plain-spoken Ms. Slaughter to fire back that their convoluted dispute over procedure was just subterfuge.“In reality, it’s about blocking much-needed health care reform in this nation,” she said. “Those who oppose the process don’t want any debate or votes on health care itself. They just want to make reform go away.”In recent years, one of her top priorities was an ethics measure intended to prevent lawmakers and other federal officials from profiting in the stock market from inside knowledge. This was one instance that cost her some friends in the House. Representative Chris Collins, a Republican from a neighboring New York district, described her to Fox News as a “despicable human being” after she complained to House ethics watchdogs about his efforts on behalf of a biotech company in which he owned stock.Ms. Slaughter, the oldest member of the House at her death, had been weighing re-election and was being encouraged to run again and perhaps regain her chairmanship should Democrats take back the House. Mr. McGovern said her energy and optimism remained high.“She genuinely loved this institution, she loved Congress and she cared deeply about people and policy,” he said. “Some people hang around here and get tired. I think she enjoyed her job up to the very last day she was here. She had a lot more to give.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/world/americas/trump-venezuela-sanctions-petro.html","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration announced on Monday that it was broadening sanctions against Venezuela, blacklisting four government officials and banning a digital currency President Nicolás Maduro created last month to circumvent financial sanctions on his economically strapped nation.The White House said the new measures were intended to send a message to Mr. Maduro’s government, which it has accused of corruption and repression, that the United States remains focused on the economic devastation in Venezuela, and holds the president and his associates directly responsible for creating the conditions there. The nation is in the throes of food and medicine shortages and a collapse of the health system as well as other government services, circumstances that have prompted hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans to flee.The intensification of sanctions comes as President Trump prepares to attend the Summit of the Americas next month in Lima, Peru, where the crisis in Venezuela will be a central issue. Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to deliver a speech this week at the Organization of American States in Washington, where he plans to call out “the Maduro regime’s lawless actions,” according to a spokeswoman, and urge swift action to address the humanitarian situation and restore political order.The sanctions also come just two months before Mr. Maduro is to stand for re-election in a race he is expected to win given his control of Venezuela’s political and judicial machinery. The United States is among the countries that have declared they will not recognize the results.“President Maduro decimated the Venezuelan economy and spurred a humanitarian crisis,” Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement announcing the newly blacklisted individuals. Mr. Mnuchin cited the individuals for “economic mismanagement and corruption” and blasted an attempt by the Maduro government to evade sanctions through the creation of a new digital currency known as Petro.“Instead of correcting course to avoid further catastrophe, the Maduro regime is attempting to circumvent sanctions through the Petro digital currency — a ploy that Venezuela’s democratically elected National Assembly has denounced and Treasury has cautioned U.S. persons to avoid,” he said.The sanctions brought an angry response from Mr. Maduro, who issued a statement that the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington “rejects and strongly condemns the alleged and unilateral new sanctions of the Donald Trump regime against the Venezuelan people and our financial and economic system.”The administration’s announcement came a few hours after Mr. Trump signed an executive order barring the use of any digital currency issued by the Maduro government since Jan. 9. Mr. Maduro announced last month that his country had begun a presale of the Petro, backed by the nation’s vast petroleum reserves. The Venezuelan government called the launch a response to a financial crisis that has prompted a profound devaluation of the national currency, the bolívar, and quadruple-digit inflation.Senior Trump administration officials said the sanctions were meant to apply to the Petro or any other currency issued by or on behalf of Venezuela. One official said the Petro should be viewed as directly supporting the Maduro dictatorship and its attempts to undermine democratic order in Venezuela, calling it a scam to defraud international investors. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sanctions and their purpose.Whether the sanctions will achieve their intended effect of destabilizing the government remains to be seen, but some experts cautioned that the moves could actually hurt Venezuelans in the short term.“It’s part of a pattern of escalating sanctions on the Maduro government in advance of the presidential elections later this year, with the idea that that will produce the collapse of the government,” said Cynthia J. Arnson, the director of the Wilson Center’s Latin American Program. “But it’s usually the case that governments dig in their heels all the more when they feel that sanctions are aimed at removing them from power instead of producing a change in behavior, and what this will do is certainly increase the suffering and the shortages that are happening now.”Mr. Mnuchin, who is attending a gathering of finance ministers in Argentina, said he and his counterparts had discussed “how to achieve our shared objectives of restoring Venezuelan democracy, combating the kleptocracy of the Maduro regime, and responding to the humanitarian crisis caused by Maduro’s economic policy.”“We urge Maduro to distribute humanitarian aid and stop blocking much-needed foreign assistance to the suffering people of Venezuela, and we again call upon the Venezuelan military to respect and uphold the Constitution,” Mr. Mnuchin said.The four people sanctioned by the Treasury Department on Monday are current and former officials who played key roles in Mr. Maduro’s government and political network. Américo Alex Mata García is a Venezuelan state bank director who allegedly solicited and funneled $35 million from Odebrecht, a Brazilian construction company involved in a worldwide corruption scandal, to Mr. Maduro’s presidential campaign in 2013, the department said. Willian Antonio Contreras heads the agency responsible for imposing price controls in Venezuela. Nelson Reinaldo Lepaje Salazar is the acting chief of the Office of the National Treasury of Venezuela, which has been the subject of previous corruption allegations, including that Mr. Maduro stole nearly $10 million from the agency. The department also designated Carlos Alberto Rotondaro Cova, the former president of the board of directors of the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security, the government agency in charge of providing patients with drugs for chronic conditions.The four will have any assets subject to United States jurisdiction frozen, and Americans are generally barred from engaging in financial transactions with the individuals.The sanctions announced on Monday notably did not include any restrictions on the oil sector in Venezuela, a drastic step that senior Trump administration officials say is still under consideration. Rex W. Tillerson, the departing secretary of state, has suggested that Mr. Trump is considering a ban on imports of Venezuelan crude to American refineries. That would be a crippling blow to the national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, since the United States is its biggest customer and few refineries outside the United States have the capacity to process Venezuelan heavy crude.One Trump administration official said on Monday that the step required further study because it would have serious ramifications not only for the Maduro government, but for the people of Venezuela and the American economy. The official said the administration was exploring both broad and surgical sanctions against Venezuelan oil interests.Venezuela is the first country to issue its own digital currency, and the government appears to view the Petro as its best hope for reaching the international markets at a time when most investors have turned their back on the country. The Treasury Department had already warned that buying the Petro could “expose U.S. persons to legal risk.”The executive order, with its explicit ban, is likely to serve as a warning for other countries that have been looking at issuing virtual currencies to work around international sanctions. Russian government officials have discussed creating a so-called crypto ruble for similar purposes, but have not moved ahead with the plan so far.Risa Grais-Targow, the director for Latin America at the Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis consultancy, said given that the Petro has not yielded significant benefits in Venezuela — the currency has not proved profitable despite Mr. Maduro’s grandiose claims, she said — the sanctions are unlikely to have a major economic impact.“It’s more symbolic,” Ms. Grais-Targow said of Monday’s measures. “The Trump administration’s desire here is to continue to gradually ratchet up sanctions on the Maduro government, and this is something that is lighter, maybe lower-hanging fruit as they consider sanctions on the oil sector that would be more politically controversial and produce a sharper economic bite,” both in Venezuela and in the United States.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/books/james-comey-book-higher-loyalty.html","James B. Comey’s upcoming book, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,” briefly jumped to No. 1 on Amazon’s best-seller list on Sunday, about a month before its publication date of April 17. The spike in preorders occurred a couple of days after the former F.B.I. deputy director Andrew G. McCabe was fired, prompting a string of tweets by President Trump in which he said Mr. McCabe was a “choirboy” next to Mr. Comey, whom he called “sanctimonious.”The early interest in “A Higher Loyalty” is comparable to the advance buzz for “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” Michael Wolff’s exposé of the current administration, which was published earlier this year. Mr. Wolff’s book also hit the top of the Amazon best-seller list before its release, and the publishing house and book sellers were unprepared for the demand.There appears to be an enormous appetite for books that give insight into the Trump White House. “Fire and Fury” has sold more than a million copies across all formats, and it remains at the top of The New York Times’s hardcover nonfiction best sellers list. It has been on the list for 10 weeks. Similarly, upon its release, “Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump” by Michael Isikoff and David Corn sold so quickly that Amazon temporarily shut down the buy button on the book’s page, according to Twelve, an imprint of Hachette Book Group and the book’s publisher, likely believing bots were manipulating the sales. It has sold 47,000 copies in its first week, and on Monday evening, it was right behind “A Higher Loyalty” on Amazon’s politics and social sciences best-seller list.Mr. Comey’s book dropped to No. 2 over all on Amazon on Monday, it was replaced with “A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo,” a parody book commissioned by John Oliver based on a picture book about the Pence family’s real-life rabbit, which was written by Mr. Pence’s daughter. Macmillan, which owns Flatiron Books, declined to comment on preorders but confirmed an initial printing of 450,000. Mr. Comey stoked anticipation for “A Higher Loyalty” by responding to Mr. Trump’s tweets on Sunday. “Mr. President, the American people will hear my story very soon. And they can judge for themselves who is honorable and who is not,” he said. In a statement, Macmillan said the book would “explore what good, ethical leadership looks like.”
         Correction: March 19, 2018  An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of the F.B.I. deputy director who was fired last week. He is Andrew G. McCabe, not McGabe.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/supreme-court-pennsylvania-voting-maps.html","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court rejected on Monday a second emergency application from Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania seeking to overturn decisions from that state’s highest court, which had ruled that Pennsylvania’s congressional map had been warped by partisan gerrymandering and then imposed one of its own.The ruling means a new map drawn by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court will very likely be in effect in this year’s elections, setting the stage for possible gains by Democrats. Under the current map, Republicans hold 12 seats while Democrats hold five and are expected to pick up another when the result of a special election last week is certified.The latest application was denied by the full Supreme Court without comment or noted dissents.In a  terse ruling in January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the state’s congressional map, saying that it “clearly, plainly and palpably” violated the state’s Constitution. The court told state lawmakers to redraw the state’s 18 House districts, which favored Republicans.Pennsylvania Republicans asked the Supreme Court to block that ruling, but their request was rejected last month by Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr.The Republican-controlled state legislature then drew a new map, but it was vetoed by Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat. The state court imposed a new map, prepared with the help of Nathaniel Persily, a Stanford law professor and an expert in legislative districting. The court said the map’s voting districts were not warped by politics and “follow the traditional redistricting criteria of compactness, contiguity, equality of population and respect for the integrity of political subdivisions.”The denial of the latest application, like the denial of the earlier one, was unsurprising because the Pennsylvania court had based its rulings solely on the state Constitution. On matters of state law, the judgments of state supreme courts are typically final.The Republican lawmakers in the Pennsylvania case argued that the United States Supreme Court could nonetheless step in, saying their case was partly governed by federal law. They pointed to Article I, Section 4 of the United States Constitution, which says that the times, places and manners of congressional elections “shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof.”The lawmakers said the State Supreme Court had usurped the legislature’s role in violation of federal law. That argument did not appear to gain traction with Justice Alito.In a brief urging the United States Supreme Court not to intercede, lawyers for Mr. Wolf wrote that there were practical reasons to let the state court’s rulings stand. “A stay at this point,” they wrote, “will force the congressional primaries to be rescheduled at an estimated cost of $20 million, or canceled entirely.”Hours before the Supreme Court issued its order, a panel of three federal judges rejected a third and quite similar challenge to the State Supreme Court’s map from Republicans in Pennsylvania’s State Senate. The panel of two United States district judges and one federal court of appeals judge said the Republican senators did not have standing to sue.While further court challenges are possible, Monday’s decisions make it very likely that this year’s congressional elections in Pennsylvania will be conducted using the new map, which will help Democrats.The Supreme Court has been intensely engaged with the question of partisan gerrymandering, in which the party in power draws voting districts to give its candidates lopsided advantages, in cases this term from Wisconsin and Maryland. Those cases are appeals from decisions of federal courts.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html","Our report that a political firm hired by the Trump campaign acquired access to private data on millions of Facebook users has sparked new questions about how the social media giant protects user information.Who collected all that data?Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm hired by President Trump’s 2016 election campaign, gained access to private information on more than 50 million Facebook users. The firm offered tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior.Cambridge has been largely funded by Robert Mercer, the wealthy Republican donor, and Stephen K. Bannon, a former adviser to the president who became an early board member and gave the firm its name. It has pitched its services to potential clients ranging from Mastercard and the New York Yankees to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On Monday, a British TV news report cast it in a harsher light, showing video of Cambridge Analytica executives offering to entrap politicians. Read more about how Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign became linked.What kind of information was collected, and how was it acquired?The data, a portion of which was viewed by The New York Times, included details on users’ identities, friend networks and “likes.” The idea was to map personality traits based on what people had liked on Facebook, and then use that information to target audiences with digital ads.Researchers in 2014 asked users to take a personality survey and download an app, which scraped some private information from their profiles and those of their friends, activity that Facebook permitted at the time and has since banned.The technique had been developed at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Center. The center declined to work with Cambridge Analytica, but Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American psychology professor at the university, was willing.Dr. Kogan built his own app and in June 2014 began harvesting data for Cambridge Analytica.He ultimately provided over 50 million raw profiles to the firm, said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who oversaw Cambridge Analytica’s data harvesting. Only about 270,000 users — those who participated in the survey — had consented to having their data harvested, though they were all told that it was being used for academic use.Facebook said no passwords or “sensitive pieces of information” had been taken, though information about a user’s location was available to Cambridge.Read more about the internal tension at the top of Facebook over the platform’s political exploitation.So was Facebook hacked?Facebook in recent days has insisted that what Cambridge did was  not a data breach, because it routinely allows researchers to have access to user data for academic purposes — and users consent to this access when they create a Facebook account.But Facebook prohibits this kind of data to be sold or transferred “to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.” It says that was exactly what Dr. Kogan did, in providing the information to a political consulting firm.Dr. Kogan declined to provide The Times with details of what had happened, citing nondisclosure agreements with Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.Cambridge Analytica officials, after denying that they had obtained or used Facebook data, changed their story last week. In a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Dr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.But the data, or at least copies, may still exist. The Times was recently able to view a set of raw data from the profiles Cambridge Analytica obtained.Read more about how Facebook allows third-party apps to collect users’ data.What is Facebook doing in response?The company issued a statement on Friday saying that in 2015, when it learned that Dr. Kogan’s research had been turned over to Cambridge Analytica, violating its terms of service, it removed Dr. Kogan’s app from the site. It said it had demanded and received certification that the data had been destroyed.Facebook also said: “Several days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.”In a further step, Facebook said Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm “to determine the accuracy of the claims that the Facebook data in question still exists.” It said that Cambridge Analytica had agreed to the review and that Dr. Kogan had given a verbal commitment, while Mr. Wylie “thus far has declined.”Read more about how to protect your data on Facebook.What are others saying?Facebook, already facing deep questions over the use of its platform by those seeking to spread Russian propaganda and fake news, is facing a renewed backlash after the news about Cambridge Analytica. Investors have not been pleased, sending shares of the company down around 7 percent on Monday.■ Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has pressed Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, to appear before the panel to explain what the social network knew about the misuse of its data “to target political advertising and manipulate voters.”■ The attorney general of Massachusetts, Maura Healey, announced on Saturday that her office was opening an investigation. “Massachusetts residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said in a Twitter post. Facebook’s lack of disclosure on the harvesting of data could violate privacy laws in Britain and several states.■ Damian Collins, a Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is leading a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian meddling in the country’s referendum on leaving the European Union, said this weekend that he, too, would call on Mr. Zuckerberg or another top executive to testify.Read more details on the fallout.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/cambridge-analytica-alexander-nix.html","WASHINGTON — Sitting in a hotel bar, Alexander Nix, who runs the political data firm Cambridge Analytica, had a few ideas for a prospective client looking for help in a foreign election. The firm could send an attractive woman to seduce a rival candidate and secretly videotape the encounter, Mr. Nix said, or send someone posing as a wealthy land developer to pass a bribe.“We have a long history of working behind the scenes,” Mr. Nix said.The prospective client, though, was actually a reporter from Channel 4 News in Britain, and the encounter was secretly filmed as part of a monthslong investigation into Cambridge Analytica, the data firm with ties to President Trump’s 2016 campaign.The results of Channel 4’s work were broadcast in Britain on Monday, days after reports in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.The weekend’s reports about the data misuse have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.Now, the Channel 4 broadcast appears likely to cast an even harsher spotlight on the company, which was founded by Stephen K. Bannon and Robert Mercer, a wealthy Republican donor who has put at least $15 million into Cambridge Analytica.The firm’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for the Trump campaign in 2016, though many have questioned their effectiveness.Less noticed has been the work that Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group, have done outside the United States. The operations of the two companies were set up with a convoluted corporate structure and are deeply intertwined.Mr. Nix, for instance, holds dual appointments at the two companies. Cambridge Analytica is registered in Delaware and almost wholly owned by the Mercer family, but it is effectively a shell — it holds intellectual property rights to its so-called psychographic modeling tools, yet its clients are served by the staff at London-based SCL and overseen by Mr. Nix, who is a British citizen.SCL Elections has clients around the world, and it has experimented with data-driven microtargeting techniques in the Caribbean and Africa, where privacy rules are lax or nonexistent and politicians employing SCL have been happy to provide government-held data, according to former employees.[ALSO READ: How Cambridge Analytica Harvested Facebook Data, Triggering a New Outcry]But in the footage broadcast by Channel 4, Mr. Nix offered services that go far beyond data harvesting. The Times did not work with Channel 4 on its report about Cambridge Analytica.“Many of our clients don’t want to be seen to be working with a foreign company,” he told the Channel 4 reporter, who was not identified. “We can set up fake IDs and websites, we can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists. There’s so many options we can look at.”The Channel 4 reporter posed as a “fixer” for a wealthy Sri Lankan family that wanted to help politicians they favored. In a series of meetings at London hotels between November and January, all of which were secretly filmed, Mr. Nix and other executives boasted that Cambridge Analytica employs front companies and former spies on behalf of political clients.The information that is uncovered through such clandestine work is then put “into the bloodstream to the internet,” said Mark Turnbull, another Cambridge executive, in an encounter in December 2017 at the Berkeley hotel in London.“Then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again, over time, to watch it take shape,” he added. “It has to happen without anyone thinking, ‘That’s propaganda.’ Because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda,’ the next question is, ‘Who’s put that out?’”The most damning footage, though, was of Mr. Nix’s suggestion that the company could entrap political rivals through seduction or bribery.At a meeting in January, also at the Berkeley hotel, Mr. Nix was direct about the techniques SCL could use to aid a client.“I mean, deep digging is interesting,” he said. “But you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s too good to be true, and make sure that that’s video-recorded, you know. These sorts of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption, putting it on the internet, these sorts of things.”Mr. Nix then suggested they could have someone pose as a wealthy developer. “They will offer a large amount of money to the candidate, to finance his campaign in exchange for land for instance,” he said. “We’ll have the whole thing recorded on cameras.”Or, Mr. Nix said, they could “send some girls around to the candidate’s house — we have lots of history of things.”The reporter asked what kind of girls, and Mr. Nix said they could find some Ukrainian women. “I’m just saying, we could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us you know,” Mr. Nix replied. “You know what I’m saying.”“They are very beautiful,” he said. “I find that works very well.”To be sure, though, Mr. Nix said that he was speaking only in hypotheticals. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done and what, what has been done,” he said.Cambridge Analytica, in a statement issued after the Channel 4 broadcast, said the report was “edited and scripted to grossly misrepresent the nature of those conversations and how the company conducts its business.”The company said that it was the undercover reporter who had raised the idea of entrapping politicians, and that the executives had been trying to assess his intent. Mr. Nix and Mr. Turnbull “humored these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to disclose his intentions,” it said.“They left with grave concerns and did not meet with him again,” the company said.For Mr. Nix, the footage comes at an already perilous moment. Earlier this month, he told a parliamentary inquiry into fake news and Russian interference in Britain’s referendum to exit the European Union that Cambridge Analytica never used or possessed Facebook data.But following the reports in The Times and Observer on Saturday, Damian Collins, the Conservative lawmaker leading the inquiry, said he planned to call Mr. Nix back to testify.“It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament,” Mr. Collins said in a statement this weekend.Elizabeth Denham, the British information commissioner, told Channel 4 News that on March 7 she asked for access to Cambridge Analytica, setting a deadline of 6 p.m. Monday. Ms. Denham said she did not accept the response as satisfactory and so would be applying in court on Tuesday for a warrant.“We need to look at the databases, we need to look at the servers and understand how the data was processed,” she said.In a statement, Facebook said that it had “hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica.”But Mr. Collins, who is chairman of the House of Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said he was concerned that Facebook might gain access to data before the information commissioner did.“What are they doing?” Mr. Collins asked on Channel 4 News. “Are they going in to physically recover data, to disturb the files? This investigation should be for the authorities.”Mr. Collins said that the former Cambridge Analytica employee who came forward to disclose his company’s actions, Christopher Wylie, would be giving evidence to his committee. He said he wanted Mark Zuckerberg, or another senior executive from Facebook, to do the same.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/nyregion/cuomo-leads-cynthia-nixon-and-gop-hopefuls-in-2018-re-election-poll.html","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is entering his re-election campaign with a commanding lead over both his Republican rivals and a possible Democratic primary opponent, the actress Cynthia Nixon, according to a new poll from Siena College.The survey shows Mr. Cuomo ahead of Ms. Nixon among Democratic voters by 66 percent to 19 percent. He leads her by a wide margin among every subgroup in the survey: men and women, moderates and liberals, black, white and Latino voters, upstate and New York City residents.Best known for her role in “Sex and the City,” Ms. Nixon entered the contest only Monday, after the poll had been completed, but had said she was exploring a bid and had been in contact with political strategists with experience running progressive campaigns. A longtime education activist in the state, Ms. Nixon has the benefit of name recognition, and yet remains broadly unknown to voters, with 60 percent saying they had no opinion of her.The poll showed Mr. Cuomo with a two-to-one advantage over both his potential Republican challengers, State Senator John DeFrancisco and Marc Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, who is expected to formally declare his candidacy at the beginning of April.Mr. Cuomo had a 52 percent approval rating in the survey, essentially unchanged from a month earlier.The survey was conducted as the two-month corruption trial of one of Mr. Cuomo’s former top aides, Joseph Percoco, ended in a guilty verdict last week. Mr. Cuomo and his team regularly emphasized that the governor himself was not charged with wrongdoing in the case.The State Democratic Party also spent $100,000 last week, while the poll was being conducted, on a television ad in the New York City area promoting Mr. Cuomo’s record on gun control.“Mostly, this survey provides the governor with good news,” said Steven Greenberg, who conducted the poll.Mr. Greenberg noted that Mr. Cuomo’s job-approval rating did slide to 42 percent, with the percentage of New York voters who said he was doing a poor job rising to 25 percent, equaling the high in a Siena College poll.Since his 2014 re-election, Mr. Cuomo has tacked to the left politically, passing an increase in the minimum wage, paid family leave and other measures as his political operation has tried to rebrand him as a progressive after a first term in which he emphasized governing from the political center.In the poll, more New Yorkers, 46 percent, rated Mr. Cuomo as a “liberal” than in any past survey. That is more than double the 21 percent who said in February 2011, his second month in office, that he was a liberal.But among Democratic voters, a majority, 52 percent, still viewed Mr. Cuomo as a moderate, compared with only 34 percent of Democrats who labeled him a liberal.Ms. Nixon is expected to challenge Mr. Cuomo from the political left. She has been in talks with former advisers to Mayor Bill de Blasio, Bill Hyers and Rebecca Katz, two architects of his 2013 mayoral bid.“One of the ideas that’s out there, that’s floating among the chattering class is that Cuomo has a problem with liberals,” Mr. Greenberg said. “That’s a canard. The truth is Cuomo has a problem with liberal leadership.”Over all, Mr. Cuomo’s standing heading into his re-election year appears to have slightly deteriorated from four years ago.In March 2014, a Siena College survey had 49 percent of New York voters saying they intended to vote to re-elect Mr. Cuomo, with 41 percent saying they preferred an alternative.This month’s poll showed a 48-percent-to-46-percent split on the same question.The statewide poll was conducted from March 11 to 16, with 772 registered New York voters, and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The sample of Democrats included 358 voters, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 6 percentage points. Mr. Greenberg noted that it was not a sample of likely Democratic primary voters.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/andrew-mccabe-fbi-firing-explained.html","WASHINGTON — Andrew G. McCabe, the former F.B.I. deputy director, was fired late Friday night — on the eve of his retirement. Here’s what we know.Who is Andrew McCabe?Mr. McCabe is a 21-year F.B.I. veteran who joined the bureau out of law school and rose to its No. 2 position in 2016. The deputy director is essentially the F.B.I.’s chief operating officer.Why does he matter?He oversaw two of the most politically charged cases in F.B.I. history: the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, and the investigation of Donald J. Trump’s campaign ties to the Russian government.Why was he fired?Mr. McCabe was questioned as part of a wide-ranging internal inquiry into the F.B.I.’s handling of the Clinton investigation and other matters. During the internal investigation, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, Mr. McCabe “lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions.” That is a fireable offense, and Mr. Sessions said that career, apolitical employees at the F.B.I. and Justice Department agreed that Mr. McCabe should be fired.At issue is whether Mr. McCabe was forthcoming with investigators about what Mr. Sessions said was an “unauthorized disclosure to the news media.”Was he leaking information to damage Mr. Trump?Not as far as anyone can tell. The story at the heart of the case was published  in The Wall Street Journal in October 2016, just days before the election as the F.B.I. raced to review newly discovered emails from Mrs. Clinton’s server. The Journal revealed a dispute between the F.B.I. and the Justice Department over how to handle a separate Clinton investigation, one into her family’s foundation.Mr. McCabe authorized an F.B.I. spokesman and lawyer to speak to The Journal to rebut suggestions that he had put the brakes on the investigation. These types of interactions between journalists and government officials — known as “background calls” — are common in all federal agencies and administrations as officials try to correct inaccuracies or provide details and nuance before reporters publish information.The Journal ultimately reported that while Justice Department officials did not authorize subpoenas, the F.B.I. in fact had pressed ahead with the case — a detail that if anything was damaging to Mrs. Clinton, not Mr. Trump.Did the White House fire Mr. McCabe?No. As a career civil servant, Mr. McCabe is not a political appointee who can be summarily dismissed by the president. But this is where the situation gets complicated. Mr. Trump has repeatedly used his Twitter account to attack Mr. McCabe. Months before the firing, he taunted Mr. McCabe about his pension.And he goaded Mr. Sessions into taking action against Mr. McCabe.On the eve of Mr. McCabe’s firing, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, called him a “bad actor.” Taken together, this unusual level of White House commentary created a political backdrop to what should have been an independent government personnel decision. Mr. McCabe’s lawyers seized on that as evidence of improper influence.“This distortion of the process begins at the very top, with the president’s repeated offensive, drive-by Twitter attacks on Mr. McCabe.” — Michael R. Bromwich, a lawyer for Mr. McCabeWhy was he fired so quickly?That is one of the big unknowns. F.B.I. disciplinary matters can drag out for extended periods, and it is not uncommon for officials to retire during that process. That did not happen here, and it is not clear why. The workings of the F.B.I.’s disciplinary office are kept confidential.Mr. McCabe’s lawyers say they were given little time to read and respond to the final report and were still receiving new evidence two days before his firing. Why the rush, they ask, if not to make sure that Mr. McCabe was fired?“This concerted effort to accelerate the process, in order to beat the ticking clock of his scheduled retirement, violates any sense of decency and basic principles of fairness,” Mr. Bromwich said.What’s the president’s beef with Mr. McCabe?Mr. Trump has seized on the fact that Mr. McCabe’s wife, Jill, ran for a Virginia State Senate seat as a Democrat and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from a political ally of Mrs. Clinton. He says Mr. McCabe never should have been allowed to oversee the Clinton investigation. He says the campaign donations are proof that a pro-Clinton bias within the F.B.I. explains why Mrs. Clinton was never charged.Mr. Trump brought up Mr. McCabe’s wife on several occasions, including a face-to-face meeting in which the president called her a “loser.”Does Mr. Trump’s criticism have merit?Yes and no. Mr. McCabe did not begin supervising the Clinton investigation until after his wife had lost the race, and records show that he sought ethics and legal advice inside the F.B.I. before deciding not to recuse himself. But some in the F.B.I. believe he should never have been involved because of his wife’s campaign donations.When he ultimately recused himself, late in the investigation, it only fueled the argument that he should have stepped aside from the beginning.Mr. Trump’s theory of Mr. McCabe as a pro-Clinton partisan, however, is on far shakier ground. Mr. McCabe has identified himself as a lifelong Republican and did not vote in the 2016 election. The newspaper story that Mr. McCabe authorized F.B.I. officials speak about was not a positive one for Mrs. Clinton.And, perhaps most importantly, in the months before the election, when the F.B.I. publicly disclosed information about its work on the Clinton investigation, it never revealed the existence and scope of a full-throated investigation into the Trump campaign’s Russia ties.What does this possibly have to do with Russia?Like so much at the F.B.I., Mr. McCabe’s firing has become inextricably entangled in presidential politics and the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. McCabe was one of only a handful of F.B.I. officials involved in the Russia investigation from the first days. He supervised it at every step and was involved in the decision to seek a wiretap on Carter Page, a former Trump foreign adviser. That wiretap application was approved by senior Justice Department officials, was reapproved by Mr. Trump’s own Justice Department and was signed by a federal judge based on evidence that Mr. Page was a Russian agent. Mr. Trump has declared that wiretap to be improper, however, and points to it as evidence of political surveillance by the F.B.I.Mr. McCabe also worked alongside the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who accused Mr. Trump of seeking a loyalty oath and pressing him to end the investigation. Those conversations are now part of an obstruction investigation. Mr. McCabe kept memos on his conversations with Mr. Comey, which could help investigators corroborate Mr. Comey’s account.Mr. McCabe argues that the Trump administration is trying to discredit him as a potential witness. The real target, Mr. McCabe said, is Mr. Mueller’s investigation. Mr. Trump’s team seemingly gave credence to that argument last weekend when the Daily Beast asked for Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer for a comment on Mr. McCabe’s firing and he responded with a call to end the Mueller investigation.From a political standpoint, if Mr. Trump discredits Mr. McCabe, he can raise questions about everything Mr. McCabe has touched — including the Russia investigation. Mr. McCabe’s allies have come to his defense.Well, he did lie, right?What we know right now is that Mr. Sessions found repeated examples in which Mr. McCabe “lacked candor.” And career officials — not Trump appointees — recommended dismissal. Mr. Sessions accepted that recommendation.“The F.B.I. expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability,” Mr. Sessions said.Mr. McCabe denies being untruthful. He says he answered every question honestly and, when he was misunderstood, he reached out to the investigators to correct the record.What’s next?We won’t be able to assess the allegations, or Mr. McCabe’s defense, until the inspector general’s report is released. That is expected sometime this spring. Mr. McCabe has seen it but cannot discuss it until it is public. When it is released, his lawyers say, he has a point-by-point rebuttal to offer.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/supreme-court-death-penalty.html","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday turned down a request that it take a fresh look at whether the death penalty is constitutional anywhere in the nation.The court also refused to consider a narrower question in the same case: Whether Arizona’s capital sentencing system, which appears to make virtually all murderers eligible for the death penalty, violates the Constitution.In a 2015 dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer had urged his colleagues to revisit the death penalty, saying that “it is highly likely” that it violates the Eighth Amendment, which bars cruel and unusual punishments. He said that there was evidence that innocent people have been executed, that death row exonerations were frequent, that death sentences were imposed arbitrarily and that the capital justice system was warped by racial discrimination and politics.Only Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the 2015 dissent, and the issue does not seem to have gained traction in the intervening years.Justice Breyer on Monday also issued a statement on the narrower challenge, saying that Arizona’s capital sentencing system may well be unconstitutional and inviting a further challenge with more evidence. Justices Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined Justice Breyer’s statement.The case concerned Abel Daniel Hidalgo, who agreed to kill Michael Cordova, whom he did not know, for $1,000 payment from a gang member. He committed the murder at an auto body shop in 2001, and he also killed Jose Rojas, a bystander who happened to be present.When the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 after a four-year moratorium, it upheld capital sentencing systems that sought to reserve the penalty for the worst offenders by insisting that juries find “aggravating factors” before a death sentence may be imposed.Arizona’s system includes so many possible factors, its critics say, that it does almost nothing to cull the worst offenders from others. Around 98 percent of convicted murderers, they say, are eligible for the death penalty there.Mr. Hidalgo pleaded guilty and was sentenced to death after a jury found that he had killed in exchange for money, committed multiple homicides and had committed another serious crime.Justice Breyer wrote that the record in the case, Hidalgo v. Arizona, No. 17-251, as too thin to adequately evaluate the argument that the state’s approach was unconstitutional.Using public records requests, Mr. Hidalgo’s lawyers had obtained information about 860 first-degree murder cases in one Arizona county. They showed that essentially every defendant was eligible for the death penalty under the state’s sentencing laws.“That evidence is unrebutted,” Justice Breyer wrote. “It points to a possible constitutional problem. And it was assumed to be true by the state courts below. Evidence of this kind warrants careful attention and evaluation.”But the state courts had rejected Mr. Hidalgo’s request for a hearing to develop and test the evidence, Justice Breyer wrote. The Supreme Court would be in a better position to consider the constitutionality of Arizona’s sentencing system, he wrote, after a more rigorous empirical inquiry.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/baseball-tax-law-.html","WASHINGTON — As President Trump congratulated the World Series champion Houston Astros at a White House ceremony last week, he also heaped praise on himself and congressional Republicans for passing a sweeping tax cut last year. He hailed Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the House’s chief tax writer and an Astros superfan, as “the king of those tax cuts.”What he did not mention is that the new tax law Mr. Brady helped draft, and which Mr. Trump signed, levies a large new tax on the Astros, and similar franchises across professional sports.The law changed a corner of the tax code that mostly applies to farmers, manufacturers and other businesses that until recently could swap certain assets like trucks and machinery tax-free. But by adding a single word to the newly written tax code — “real” — the law now allows only real estate swaps to qualify for that special treatment.That change is meant to capture more federal revenue, in order to partly offset reductions in business and personal income tax rates. It forces manufacturers, farmers and others to pay more in capital gains taxes, if they trade an asset for something more valuable. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the change will raise $31 billion over the next decade.It also means that the Astros and other sports franchises could now face capital gains taxes every time they exchange or trade their highly paid players.The provision is raising concerns and questions across Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, starting with: How do you value a player?“There is no fair-market value of a baseball player. There isn’t,” said Daniel R. Halem, the chief legal officer of Major League Baseball. “I don’t really know what our clubs are going to do to address the issue. We haven’t fully figured it out yet. This is a change we hope was inadvertent, and we’re going to lobby hard to get it corrected.”The N.B.A. is similarly perplexed. It sent teams an email this month detailing the disruption of the trading system under the new law, but told executives it was still figuring out how to respond.The confusion is only one of many side effects of the new tax law, which sped through the House and Senate in less than two months at the end of last year, resulting in a series of changes that were both intentional and inadvertent. Republicans say they weren’t trying to hamstring sports teams: The change in the like-kind provision, Senate staff members said, was simply an attempt to broaden the United States tax base.But that is little consolation to the teams who now join restaurateurs, independent agriculture businesses and multinational corporations on a long list of entities affected by the law in ways they did not see coming, and who now face long odds to secure changes or clarifications.Major League Baseball and N.B.A. officials expressed hope that Congress would revisit the provision, which is one of many parts of the law that could raise their taxes or hurt their revenues.It is unclear how aggressively the Internal Revenue Service would enforce the provision with sports teams. Mr. Halem, of Major League Baseball, said the league was asking the Treasury Department for guidance on how to come up with valuations for tax purposes. If such a system was the intended result of the law, he said, “then write some regulations, tell us what you mean.”I.R.S. officials declined to comment on whether the agency would issue future rulings on the tax treatment of sports trades. Treasury officials did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.Like many franchises, the Astros have aggressively worked the baseball trade market to improve their roster. Last year, on their way to their first World Series championship, they engineered a last-minute deal ahead of the league’s trade deadline to acquire Justin Verlander, a veteran starting pitcher midway through a six-year, $162 million contract, from the Detroit Tigers in exchange for three up-and-coming young players. Last month, the Astros acquired the veteran pitcher Gerrit Cole from the Pittsburgh Pirates in a similar trade.For decades, teams have not paid taxes on such trades, and thus have not had to account for the value of the assets they are exchanging, for tax purposes. A 1967 ruling from the Internal Revenue Service allowed baseball owners to depreciate the cost of player contracts over several years, thus reducing the team’s taxable income. It declared that “trades of player contracts owned by major league baseball clubs will be considered exchanges of like-kind property” under a section of the tax code.That distinction was crucial. Until this year, the “like-kind” provision allowed owners of similar types of property, such as machinery or fleet vehicles, to swap their assets without paying taxes on either party’s gains until the asset was sold. In a baseball or basketball trade, the assets aren’t players, they are the players’ contracts — and the I.R.S. was allowing them to be exchanged without fear of taxation.The new law breaks that peace, by limiting like-kind exchanges to “real property,” which is shorthand for land or other real estate.“I don’t think that they thought about baseball when they thought about this change,” said Kari Smoker, an accounting professor at SUNY Brockport who has consulted for the N.B.A. and National Hockey League players’ associations in legislative disputes over sports taxation. “It raises all kinds of issues, which I think were easier to ignore, probably, when we had a simple rule that it was a like-kind exchange.”Mr. Verlander, for example, was clearly a more immediately valuable asset to the Astros than the three prospects they traded to get him. He gave up only four runs in his five regular-season starts for the team, then won four straight starts to begin the playoffs. In very simple terms, he brought value to the Astros in a trade, and had the new law been in place last year, the team would have owed taxes on that added value.But what, exactly, was that value? Was it the size of his contract? Mr. Verlander earned $28 million last year, while the players traded for him drew minor league salaries. Was it the additional wins he brought to the team? Statisticians estimate Mr. Verlander gave the Astros nearly two more wins last season, a value that, depending on the statistician, could reach $20 million. Or was it some calculation of the total future value Mr. Verlander will bring to the team, minus the total future value it gave up in the prospects it traded away — and possibly adjusted for the amount the team will have to pay Mr. Verlander?Complicating matters further is that teams value players differently, and one player might help a certain team far more than another team. A struggling club with a surplus of starting pitchers might trade one to a playoff contender in desperate need of one, in exchange for position players who could improve a struggling lineup. In that case, both teams could, reasonably, be considered to have gained value in the trade, and thus would owe taxes on it.That is exactly how Adam Guttridge views the trade of Mr. Verlander — as a win-win for both the Astros and Tigers, which would have resulted in a capital-gains tax bill for each of them. Mr. Guttridge is a former manager of baseball research and development for the Milwaukee Brewers and a co-founder of NEIFI, a consultancy that has developed software to attach a dollar value to every professional ballplayer and his expected future performance.How to calculate such value for tax purposes “is the question that somebody has to answer, that nobody in the baseball space has,” Mr. Guttridge said. “There’s certainly no consensus among the 30 teams.”Several baseball executives declined to comment on the change and how it could affect their willingness to trade players in the future, including the general manager of the Astros, Jeff Luhnow.Basketball could be an even trickier proposition, because it taxes teams if they exceed a certain amount of total player salary for the season. This year, the Portland Trail Blazers traded a player with a modest contract in order to get under the tax threshold, saving themselves millions. The Cleveland Cavaliers made a series of trades that pushed them over the threshold. Some N.B.A. executives — who would not speak for publication — wondered if the Trail Blazers would need to pay federal tax on the money they avoided in league taxes as a result of a trade.The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, did not return a request for comment on whether he would be inclined to support a bill to change the law for sports teams. Neither did Mr. Brady, the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, who reveled in the Astros championship run last year.“At my desk,” he posted on Twitter, alongside a picture of himself, on Nov. 1, the day of Game 7 of the World Series, “wearing my #Astros tie, putting final touches on the first bold #TaxReform in 31 years.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/politics/europe-digital-tax-trade.html","WASHINGTON — A global attempt to prevent large, multinational companies from shifting their profits to lower-tax jurisdictions is setting off a fight between the United States and Europe, as policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic spar over efforts to impose new taxes on foreign firms.On Wednesday, the European Commission is expected to take aim at Silicon Valley’s tech giants with a proposal to seriously revamp how technology companies are taxed in the 28-nation European Union. The plan, outlined in a draft obtained by The New York Times, would tax digital media companies based on where they generate revenue, rather than where they have their regional headquarters, which are often in countries like Ireland and Luxembourg that have lower tax rates.The proposal comes in the wake of the new $1.5 trillion tax law that President Trump signed last year, which tried to crack down on profit-shifting by imposing a new minimum tax on the overseas earnings of any companies with United States operations. The international provisions in the United States tax law have angered some European leaders, who say they go too far and may violate World Trade Organization rules.The global tensions — and the dueling tax efforts — stem from a shared concern among foreign governments that large, multinational corporations are not paying their fair share of taxes to the countries where they do business. American tech giants like Amazon, Apple and Google have kept their tax bills low for years by keeping profits overseas in lower-tax jurisdictions.But there is no agreement about how to remedy such tax avoidance. The efforts are exacerbating the already heightened strain between the United States and Europe over a White House plan to impose stiff tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports.“Tax and trade have basically merged” as issues between the United States and Europe, said Jay Khosla, the staff director for the Senate Finance Committee.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has been trying to coordinate global efforts to combat tax evasion. In a report  on digital taxation issued on Friday, which was separate from the European Union proposal, the organization said that more than 110 countries agreed to review the international tax system, parts of which had been rendered obsolete by the digital economy.Officials from the organization said that debate over the proposed European digital tax had been intense at the gathering of the Group of 20 finance ministers in Buenos Aires on Monday. Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, assailed the concept as unfair to American companies.“We think that having gross taxes on internet companies is not fair,” Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting. “It is not the basis of how we think that they should be taxed, and we have been very clear in those discussions.”He added: “To the extent that there are issues with change in taxation systems regarding physical presence, that needs to be addressed. It should not be a two-tiered system where internet companies are taxed under a different standard.”Pascal Saint-Amans, the director of the O.E.C.D.’s Center for Tax Policy and Administration, said that the level of animosity could undermine what had been a coordinated, global effort to crack down on tax avoidance.“There are very positive aspects which should be conducive to conversation, but the background is tension, with risks,” Mr. Saint-Amans said, adding that his organization was trying to ensure that “these countries don’t go to war, at a time when there are some worries on that front.”The European Union’s new tax proposal is expected to hit Silicon Valley tech companies the hardest by forcing them to pay taxes to governments where they do business.For example, Amazon operates across the European Union, but lists its regional headquarters as Luxembourg, a tiny country but one with legal loopholes, sweetheart tax deals and low effective corporate taxes. The European Commission estimates that digital businesses pay an average effective tax rate of just 9.5 percent, compared with the 23.3 percent that traditional businesses pay.Amazon has been the focus of European officials in the past. Last year, Luxembourg was ordered by the European Union’s commissioner for competition, Margrethe Vestager, to collect around 250 million euros, or about $293 million, in unpaid taxes from Amazon.Amazon is not alone. European regulators have pressed technology companies on a range of issues, mounting an aggressive campaign against tax avoidance, the mishandling of private data and anti-competitive behavior. But that push has prompted complaints from American tech giants, which argue that they are being unfairly singled out by Brussels. European officials strongly deny those claims, arguing that Europe welcomes American technology, but not tax evasion.Within the past few years, the European Commission has ordered Apple to pay €13 billion in back taxes and levied fines against other tech giants for abusing their dominant market positions. In January, European antitrust officials fined Qualcomm, the chip maker, €997 million for illegally shutting rivals out of the market for certain smartphone and tablet chipsets for more than five years. Qualcomm said it would appeal the ruling.Last year, the European Commission fined Google €2.42 billion for using its search engine to favor its own comparison shopping service — called Google Shopping — in search results while demoting results of rival services. Google has appealed the ruling.Now, as the European Union prepares to institute comprehensive new data protection rules in May, European regulators have opened a novel line of attack. They are investigating the tech giants’ vast information-gathering operations as potential anti-competitive abuses.In December, Germany’s federal cartel office said Facebook had abused its dominant position by requiring its users to let the social network “limitlessly amass” data by tracking them through other online services — including the Facebook-owned platforms Instagram and WhatsApp. Antitrust regulators said they were “not convinced that users have given their effective consent” to Facebook’s data practices and that the extent of the data collection violated mandatory European data protection principles.In a blog post, Facebook said that it was cooperating with the German agency, but challenged the claim that it had a dominant position, saying that the social network was merely “popular in Germany.” The company also said it would “be working directly with relevant data protection officials” to ensure compliance with the upcoming European data regulation.The European Commission’s new proposed tax is likely to apply to companies with annual global revenue of more than 750 million euros, or about $925 million, and cover sales generated within the bloc that top €50 million a year. It would affect revenue coming from specific digital services, such as digital advertising, paid subscriptions and the selling of personal data. The relatively high threshold is intended to ensure that the tax affects only large companies with a significant presence in the European Union.The exact thresholds and rates have not yet been established, and the plan is not guaranteed to be put into effect, either. The proposals must still be approved by the parliament and the bloc’s member states, and although countries such as France and Germany have raised concerns over companies they say have not paid their fair share of taxes, other member states like Ireland have opposed changes to a system in which they can use tax policy to attract businesses.“The taxation will go to the biggest markets with the most sales, and that effectively means that activities which could be taxed in Estonia will be transferred to Germany,” said Peter Chase, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Brussels who focuses on the trans-Atlantic economy, trade and digital policy. “Some member states may question whether that redistribution is a good thing.”As the schism widens between the continents on how to ensure fairness on issues like market competition and data privacy rights in the digital era, it is not clear what steps Washington might take in response to a new European digital tax, but there could be calls for the Trump administration to retaliate.In 2015, when the European Union tried to go after American technology companies for tax avoidance, some lawmakers urged the Treasury Department to use the president’s authority to retaliate on the grounds that Europe was imposing discriminatory taxes on American businesses.But European leaders are not just rankled by American tech companies, they are rankled by United States tax policy as well. They have criticized provisions of the new law that tax multinational corporations with operations in the United States, particularly a provision that taxes the American subsidiaries of foreign banks for loans they receive from their parent companies, saying that goes too far and violates World Trade Organization rules.There is some concern among Republican lawmakers that Washington’s push to impose tariffs could allow Europeans to argue to the trade body that the United States is engaged in a pattern of protectionist actions, not just on trade, but on taxes. The dispute could heat up on the sidelines of the G-20 conference in Argentina this week, where Mr. Mnuchin is meeting with other finance ministers.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/us/native-american-woman-congress.html","ALBUQUERQUE — When Deb Haaland was a child, she would rise early on this state’s sun-beaten tribal land, sling a water jar around her waist and climb the mesa overlooking her pueblo.It was as high as she ever thought she would go.Now, she is among a historic number of Native American women running for elective office. None has ever served in Congress, but that could change this year if Ms. Haaland wins.In all, there are at least four indigenous women running for Congress, three more are bidding for governors’ offices and another 31 are campaigning for seats in state legislatures — from both sides of the aisle.The numbers far outstrip past election cycles, longtime observers of native politics say, and they are only partly driven by the liberal energy and #MeToo declarations that have flourished since President Trump’s election.More broadly, they are part of a decades-long shift in which native communities, long marginalized by United States voting laws and skeptical of a government that stripped them of land and traditions, are moving into mainstream politics.Montana has more than a dozen Native Americans running for the state House this year. Utah tribes are pushing the governor to make a seat for them in his cabinet. Five native people serve in the Minnesota Legislature, and four of them are women.“American Indians have been invisible for so long, in so many sectors in society,” said Denise Juneau, who was among the first native women in the country to be elected to a statewide executive position when she became the Montana schools superintendent in 2009. In that role, she developed an Indian history curriculum that is being replicated across the American West. “To be able to make inroads in the political world,” she said, “is huge.”Many of these candidates are running on a liberal platform fueled by opposition to the Trump administration, as Ms. Haaland is. But others are Republicans who don’t fit that mold at all.One is Andria Tupola, a Native Hawaiian lawmaker running for governor of Hawaii on a promise of tax cuts and small government. Another is Sharon Clahchischilliage, who was a co-chairwoman of Mr. Trump’s Native American coalition in 2016 and is running for re-election to the New Mexico House on a platform she calls “fighting the environmentalists.”Ms. Clahchischilliage is a fierce advocate for a coal-fired power plant that employs many Navajo people. She is hoping Mr. Trump will halt the threatened closing of the plant. Keeping it open, she said, could save 1,600 jobs.“What I love about Trump is that he understands,” she said. “He gets it. He is asking: What regulations need to change?”Here in Albuquerque, Ms. Haaland, a Democrat, recently won 35 percent of the vote in a six-candidate field at the state party convention. She is a “strong contender” to win the June primary, said Joe Monahan, a longtime New Mexico political blogger. (Her district covers most of Albuquerque and has elected Democrats for a decade).“We’re seeing a new generation of Native Americans who have seen more opportunity in education starting to knock down the doors in politics,” Mr. Monahan said. “And it’s not a loud movement, but it’s a steady movement.”Ms. Haaland is a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo, a sovereign nation west of Albuquerque that is one the country’s 573 federally recognized tribes. A child of military veterans, she attended 13 public schools before graduating from high school, then started a salsa company and worked as a cake decorator before putting herself through college and law school on a mix of food stamps and student loans.She entered politics in 2008 as a volunteer for Barack Obama, then spent years crisscrossing the state to register native voters in some of the country’s most remote corners. In 2015, she became the head of the state Democratic Party and helped to flip the New Mexico House of Representatives back to Democratic control.On the campaign trail, she frequently cites her heritage, and she makes the argument that many of the issues affecting native communities — the ubiquity of low-wage jobs, violence against women — afflict other groups as well.“I know what it’s like to get my health care from the Indian Health Service, and hold a sick child in the waiting room for three hours until you have a chance to see a doctor,” she said in an interview at her headquarters, a sparsely furnished office downtown splashed with political signs saying “Healthcare Not Warfare” and “¡Obámanos Nuevo México!”Her priority in Congress, she said, would be to turn New Mexico into a solar energy powerhouse, a message with appeal in an impoverished state that has struggled to diversify an economy dependent on oil and gas.She faces a field crowded with qualified candidates, including Antoinette Sedillo Lopez, a former law school dean who has spent a career building social justice programs.The main criticism of Ms. Haaland is that she is concealing a lack of policy depth by focusing on the historic nature of her candidacy. “That as a single theme could leave her vulnerable,” Mr. Monahan said.The United States did not grant native people full citizenship and the right to vote in federal elections until 1924, and for years they were mostly absent from federal government, according to Mark Trahant, a professor at the University of North Dakota who writes extensively about Native Americans in politics.That began to change in the late 1950s, when Washington instituted a policy known as termination, abolishing tribal governments and taking Indian land.Facing existential threats, native leaders began to exhort fellow Indians to vote and run for office. Men began to make elective inroads, and in recent years women have followed. In 2001, the coalition of tribes known as the National Congress of American Indians began a voting project that continues today.To be sure, Native Americans are just 2 percent of the population, and low voter turnout persists in many communities.But that is changing in some corners, and American Indians have the potential to sway elections in states like Montana, where they make up 7 percent of the voting-age population; New Mexico, where they are more than 10 percent; and Alaska, where they are more than 17 percent.Today there are two native men in the United States House of Representatives, both Republicans from Oklahoma. (Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, has discussed having native heritage but is not enrolled in a tribe.)Among the native women seeking office this year is Peggy Flanagan, a former director of a nonprofit organization who is running for lieutenant governor of Minnesota.In an interview, Ms. Flanagan said that if she wins, she will oppose a proposed pipeline across historic Ojibwe land; send money meant to help native people to tribes rather than county governments; and bring attention to the country’s many missing and murdered native women.But Ms. Juneau, the Montana school superintendent, warned that the hardest part of winning an election as an Indian woman is proving that you can represent the entire state, not just its tribes.“It’s not like, as a person of color or as an American Indian woman, you can walk into a room and say: ‘I’m qualified,’ and everybody looks at you like that,” she said. “You have to prove it. And we will — eventually.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/economy/mcdonalds-labor.html","The Trump appointee charged with enforcing federal labor rights is moving to head off a court ruling in a case against McDonald’s that could redefine the accountability of companies for their franchisees’ employment practices.The case, being tried before a special court of the National Labor Relations Board, was brought during the Obama administration, when the board was under Democratic control. Since President Trump’s election, Republican members have regained a majority, steering the board away from a pro-labor orientation.An adverse decision for McDonald’s could have enormous implications for the franchise business model, affecting millions of workers in the fast-food industry and beyond. Employees at disparate franchise locations could seek union representation to deal directly with parent companies, rather than be left to work out disputes with franchisees.But rather than push for a decision that could create a broad precedent, the board’s new general counsel has been scrambling to broker settlement terms among the company, its franchisees and the workers at the center of the case. A judge had halted the trial for 60 days to provide a chance to do so.On Monday, when a proposed settlement was presented, the judge said not so fast.The proposal would pay a range of roughly $20 to $50,000 to several dozen workers who alleged that McDonald’s franchises had violated their labor rights. The agreement would include no admission of liability by McDonald’s or its franchisees.McDonald’s argued in a motion that the terms were far more substantial than anything the government was likely to win in court. It noted that the settlement would save years of litigation, during which time workers would receive no monetary relief.Micah Wissinger, a lawyer for the Service Employees International Union and affiliated groups, which helped bring the charges against McDonald’s and has been an advocate for the workers, called the proposal a sham.“In a real settlement, McDonald’s would take responsibility for illegally firing and harassing workers fighting to get off food stamps and out of poverty,” Mr. Wissinger said in a statement after Monday’s court appearance.The judge, Lauren Esposito, told the lawyers that she would schedule a hearing on the proposed settlement so they could air their arguments, and said the agreement would not be valid without her approval.Nonetheless, some workers have already received portions of the specified payments, according to email correspondence between an official of the National Labor Relations Board and a union lawyer.The board did not respond to a request for comment.A central question in the trial is whether McDonald’s is a so-called joint employer of workers directly employed by its franchisees. A parent company is considered a joint employer if it controls their working conditions, although the legal criteria for determining control in this context has shifted in recent years.A finding that McDonald’s is a joint employer would make the company liable for labor-law violations committed by its franchisees, and would require it to bargain with restaurant workers who unionized.The workers in the case asserted that their bosses at McDonald’s restaurants had disciplined them, retaliated against them and in some cases fired them for taking part in protests beginning in 2012 in which they demanded a $15 hourly wage and a union.The general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, at the time an appointee of President Barack Obama, investigated their charges and issued complaints against McDonald’s and its franchisees in 2014. A trial began in 2015 and continued into this year.But in January, the labor board’s new general counsel, appointed by Mr. Trump, was granted a 60-day stay in the case — which expired Monday — to pursue settlement talks.The general counsel, Peter B. Robb, argued that two labor board decisions in December, one of which changed the legal standard for determining joint employment, might have weakened aspects of the case against McDonald’s and made a settlement more likely.In his request for a stay, Mr. Robb said a settlement could “facilitate far more prompt and immediate remedial relief for the employees impacted by the alleged unfair labor practices.”Before the December decision by the board, a parent company like McDonald’s could be considered a joint employer if it exerted indirect control over workers at a franchisee, or if it had the right to exercise control over workers that it nonetheless did not exercise.After the board’s decision in December, a company had to have direct and immediate control over workers to be considered a joint employer.At the time he sought a stay, labor groups argued that Mr. Robb’s logic was specious because the board’s case against McDonald’s did not hinge on which definition of joint employment applied.Lawyers for the Service Employees International Union argued that even if the general counsel preferred to seek a settlement, it made no sense to stop the trial, which was only days from concluding, in order to do so.In a court filing, they argued that stopping the trial would give McDonald’s an advantage by preventing union lawyers from cross-examining a key witness, and that it fostered “a game of hide-the-ball.”Then, last month, one of Mr. Robb’s primary arguments for a pause in the trial was upended when the labor board, on a procedural question, reversed its December decision narrowing the definition of a joint employer. At that point, the joint employer definition reverted to what it had been earlier in the trial.Several Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, stated in a March 7 letter that the board’s reversal “eliminates whatever support may have existed for your efforts to settle the McDonald’s case so near to the trial’s close.” They urged Mr. Robb to “swiftly resume and finish the trial.”But Mr. Robb’s office pressed ahead with its efforts to reach a settlement. Last week, lawyers from the labor board’s regional offices abruptly reached out to several former McDonald’s workers involved in the case. In one instance, a labor board lawyer called a worker and asked if she “was ok with $50k” for back pay as part of the settlement, according to an email between the board and Mr. Wissinger, one of the union lawyers. The offer was conditional on the worker’s waiving her right to be reinstated in her old job.Mr. Wissinger said that the calls created the impression that workers needed to accept the offers before they consulted with him or his colleagues or anyone else, and that at least two did.“It was a done deal by the time we found out,” Mr. Wissinger said. “They were completely cutting us out of the process.”Jennifer Abruzzo, who served as deputy general counsel of the labor board until 2017, said settlement discussions that excluded lawyers who backed the workers were a break with custom.“That’s unusual,” Ms. Abruzzo said. “The charging party is the one that the regions typically go to. And the charging party in this instance is the S.E.I.U.”

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/20/593675135/abortion-and-freedom-of-speech-a-volatile-mix-heads-to-the-supreme-court","The U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday in a case that pits the right to know against the right of free speech.On one side are self-identified ""crisis pregnancy centers"" that seek to prevent abortions, and on the other side is the state of California, which enacted a law to ensure that these centers do not intentionally or unintentionally mislead the women who walk through their doors.Supporters of the California law call the state's effort nothing more than seeking ""truth in advertising.""But anti-abortion pregnancy centers see the law as unconstitutional, compelling speech that turns them into mouthpieces for a government message they disagree with.Passions run high when it comes to abortion. Add the fact that most anti-abortion pregnancy centers have a firm Christian perspective, and you have quite a volatile mix.Notice requirements for unlicensed and licensed centersThe case before the Supreme Court began in 2015 when California passed a law known as the FACT Act. (It stands for Freedom, Accountability, Comprehensive Care and Transparency.) The impetus was two-fold — first, allegations that pregnancy centers opposed to abortion were using deceptive practices; and second, concern that lower-income women, in particular, weren't aware of the free pregnancy-related services California provides, from pre-natal and delivery care to birth control and abortion.The FACT Act requires unlicensed crisis pregnancy centers to post a sign or otherwise disclose to their clients in writing that the center is not a licensed medical facility and has no licensed medical provider who supervises the provision of services. The disclosure requirement extends to advertising, which anti-abortion pregnancy centers object to as an attempt to ""drown out"" their message.But even the aggressively anti-abortion Trump administration has sided with California in arguing that this provision is constitutional.The administration, however, opposes the second provision of the law dealing with licensed centers. It requires clinics that do not provide a full range of reproductive care, including services covered by Medicaid, to post a sign that says the state provides free or low cost access to pre-natal and delivery care, birth control, and other reproductive care, including abortion.The sign is to include the phone number of the county social services office for referrals. But licensed centers do not have to post the notice in their advertising.Protecting women from deception or trampling on the ""pro-life"" message?As the state sees it, the provisions for licensed and unlicensed clinics are neutral public health measures.""We're simply trying to make sure the recipient of health care information or advice understands exactly what he or she is entitled to in terms of services and that the information is accurate,"" said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in defending the law.That is not how the anti-abortion centers see it.The law ""is requiring a licensed center... that is pro-life and wants to help women choose life, point the way to an abortion,"" said lawyer Kristen Waggoner, who represents the anti-abortion pregnancy centers that are challenging the California law. That, she adds, ""is not simply information.""As for unlicensed centers, she said, there is no need to disclose the lack of a medical license. ""They're not doing anything that requires a license,"" she said, ""so why would they need to say that?""There are plenty of good reasons, replies Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights.""There has been an explosion of these fake health clinics that mislead women in ways that are very troubling and in some cases dangerous to their health,"" Northup said. ""If these fake medical centers had on their front doors, 'We're pro-life centers. We're here to help you decide to continue your pregnancy,' there's nothing wrong with that, and that's fine. But what they're trying to do instead is lure women in on false pretenses.""In recent years, the number of pregnancy centers that counsel against abortion has dramatically increased. Today there are about 2,700 of them around the country, more than three times the number of clinics that provide abortions.And just as some states provide taxpayer funds for abortions, 14 states directly fund anti-abortion pregnancy centers. From 2001 to 2006, the centers received an estimated $30 million in federal funding.There is no data on how many of the 2,700 anti-abortion pregnancy centers are unlicensed. But unlicensed clinics offer pregnancy tests, limited ultrasounds, and, to an unskeptical eye, they can look very much like a licensed medical facility.The personnel wear surgical scrubs or white coats and ask clients to fill out medical history questionnaires. Indeed, many clinics locate next to or across the street from a full service women's reproductive health center and some use similar sounding names.Manipulating search enginesDo these anti-abortion pregnancy centers deliberately locate close to abortion clinics? ""I sure hope so,"" said anti-abortion advocate Waggoner, ""because women should have both options. And they shouldn't see only a provider that has a financial incentive to get them to abort a child."" Waggoner is arguing in the Supreme Court on Tuesday on behalf of the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, NIFLA, an umbrella group of anti-abortion pregnancy centers.Some anti-abortion pregnancy center personnel are even more blunt.Jacob Hall is director of services and client care at Care Net, an organization that supports crisis pregnancy centers. At a recent Care Net conference, he advised the centers on how to use search engines to identify key words for their marketing and websites, the object being to attract women searching online for an abortion clinic to an anti-abortion pregnancy center instead.""I know 'abortion pill' is something people are searching,"" he said. ""'Abortion clinic,' 'abortion clinic near me,' 'abortion cost,'"" Hall said. ""Fantastic key words if those phrases are on your website. If they're not, easy, just add them. Just say, 'we're here to talk to you about abortion, including abortion pills and abortion surgery.'""At the same conference, Jana Pinson, director of a crisis pregnancy center in Texas, said she had great success with the term, ""planning parenthood."" Though her clinic opposes abortion, she changed her website tag to 'The Number One Source of Abortion Information in the Coastal Bend,' ""because we are,"" she said.Brian Fisher, of Human Coalition, another group that helps anti-abortion clinics, has also advocated using these tactics to attract women seeking an abortion in hopes of derailing their plans. This sort of marketing is necessary, he argued last year, because ""the abortion-determined woman will not walk into a pregnancy center voluntarily.""Several women NPR contacted were infuriated by these tactics.Annie Filkowski went to a clinic because it advertised free pregnancy tests. She spent hours there before learning she was not pregnant, and when she then asked a counselor to write her a birth control prescription or give her advice on which method to use, she said the counselor told her, ""Birth control causes infertility and can give you cancer"" and other ""crazy"" things.Dartricia Walker said she went to a clinic for a pregnancy that she very much wanted. She mistakenly thought it was a medically licensed facility, and that the person who conducted the ultrasound was a nurse. Neither was true. She then had a miscarriage that a doctor later told her might have been avoided had she received adequate medical care.""I was really upset that I was given the wrong date,"" Walker said, ""because if I had known that I was due sooner, I would have gone sooner to an ob/gyn.""There are excellent clinics that oppose abortion, too. For an example of those, NIFLA, which is challenging the California law, referred us to ""Informed Choices,"" a licensed clinic in Gilroy, CA, that has a staff of five, including two nurses, plus a volunteer ob/gyn who supervises medical procedures, and 20 other volunteers.Christine Vatuone, the executive director, said that while the clinic does oppose abortion, and will not refer patients to an abortion provider, all patients are clearly told that they have three options: abortion, adoption and parenting — and that every room in the center has a sign with five promises: ""that we will treat them with respect, that we will protect their privacy, that we will not pressure them, that we will support them, and that we will not lie to them.""Still there is room for confusion about the clinic. Google ""pregnancy, Gilroy, CA,"" and the first three results are for Informed Choices, while the fourth is Planned Parenthood.Google ""Abortion, Gilroy, CA"" and Informed Choices comes up too.And ""on advice of counsel,"" the clinic does not display the mandatory language in the California law advising patients that the state provides free access to a full range of care from pre-natal to abortion.Many patients who seek out clinics that will support their pregnancy say they are thrilled with the counseling and material support clinics like Informed Choices provide, everything from food to baby clothes, diapers, car seats, and emotional support.""It just gave me that push to let me know that, you know, I can do this,"" said Laura Wu after visiting a crisis pregnancy center in New York. ""It is possible for me to do this alone."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/20/594096515/the-wave-of-female-candidates-is-set-for-a-wave-of-losses-come-november","Lauren Underwood is optimistic about her chances of winning a seat in Congress.""This seat is 100 percent at play. It's winnable,"" the Democratic candidate says of the Illinois 14th Congressional District, which stretches along the western and northern sides of Chicago's outer suburbs.Her attitude is maybe unremarkable — every candidate says they're optimistic — except for the fact that the odds are stacked against her. She knows very well that this race is considered a pretty safe bet for the GOP in November — the nonpartisan Cook Political Report lists it as a ""likely Republican"" win, meaning Republican incumbent Randy Hultgren has an excellent chance of holding onto his House seat.Still, Underwood is undeterred.""We're not in an average year, and I'm not an average candidate,"" she says. ""I think that that matters. What we've seen in elections out of Virginia and Texas and the special [election] in Pennsylvania is that the candidate and the quality of the election that they're running matters a lot in the election outcome.""Underwood is in good company. This year's unprecedented crop of women running for office includes a glut of women running in races that, to put it mildly, will be a challenge for them to win in November.Lots more women running equals lots more women losingAn NPR analysis shows that the influx of women candidates, beyond being heavily Democratic, features a glut of Democratic women running in races currently considered to be easy Republican wins.In total, 49 percent of the Democratic women running for the House, Senate, and governor, not including incumbents, are in ""likely"" or ""safe"" Republican races. On the other side, 34 percent of Republican women running as non-incumbents are in likely or safe Democratic House, Senate, or governors' races.And even those running for seats that are within reach for their party will still have to get through sometimes crowded primaries.The bottom line is that a wave of female candidates is going to equal a wave of women losing in 2018.Importantly, this doesn't necessarily make women unusual, according to an NPR analysis of the FEC's total candidate dataset. That data isn't perfect — it includes some candidates who filed but never made it to the ballot, for example — but it suggests that large numbers of men, particularly Democrats, have filed in districts that would be very difficult to win. Indeed, while the number of women running has increased substantially this year, the level of women as a share of all candidates has not increased all that much.Interestingly, the districts featuring female candidates followed a similar pattern in the last midterms — with many Democratic women likewise running in solid Republican districts — according to data from March 2014 provided to NPR by both the Cook Political Report and Rutgers' Center for American Women and Politics, or CAWP.Both parties have seen increases in female candidates this cycle, though far more of the increase has been among Democratic women, who have been energized by their dislike of President Trump, as well as cultural forces like the #MeToo movement.The large number of Democratic female candidates in those ""solid"" and ""likely Republican"" districts may reflect that energy, as women like Underwood hope to unseat staunch conservatives.To be clear, the candidate field will narrow considerably in the primaries. Right now, according to the Rutgers data, there are 555 women in the running for 324 U.S. House, Senate or governors' races — a figure that includes incumbents, challengers and candidates in open races.But in November, that wave of women will face its real numbers test.How many women could be elected?One way to look at the data: If a woman won every possible House race this November, women would occupy 264 House seats — well over half, and a roughly 150 percent bump from the current level of 106.But take out all of those Democratic women in races that Cook considers ""solid"" or ""likely"" Republican and Republican women in ""solid"" or ""likely Democratic"" races, and there would be a potential 162 female House members. And that's potential — assuming all of those women won.To be clear, this still gives women — particularly Democratic women — a good chance of picking up significant numbers of seats in November.Toss-up races are one opportunity for this to happen. One easily overshadowed figure in the above charts is the number of women in toss-up races this year — twice as many GOP women as in 2014, and more than five times as many Democratic women.Some women will lose, though. And that's OK with Erin Vilardi, founder and CEO of VoteRunLead, a nonpartisan group that recruits and trains women to run for office. She says her group is ""coaching women to run to lose"" for a few reasons.""One, you might actually win, because this is such a crazy election cycle in 2018,"" Vilardi says. ""No political pundit knows what voter turnout is going to be. Is it going to be 16 points higher [than the last mid-term election]? Eight points higher? Five points higher? We have no idea.""In addition, Vilardi says, a first-time candidate's 2018 campaign could teach them about fundraising and campaigning, not to mention giving them more name recognition, setting them up for an easier campaign in 2020.Running a strong campaign in 2018 could also get a candidate more respect and power within her party in advance of future elections, Vilardi adds.""Maybe it's also that you go to the party and say, 'If we had 12 people running in this race,' or 'If we had a ticket up and down,' or 'If we had been tending to the Latino population in this community,' or 'I registered 15,000 new Latinos as a part of this campaign' — those people are only voting for you. You're bringing that body of people with you,"" she says.On top of all that, Vilardi adds, new candidates can give more visibility to otherwise ignored issues.For now, Underwood has other things on her mind than the long game. She faces off against six other candidates on Tuesday (all of them men) for the Democratic nomination. She knows she's a strong candidate, having outraised all of her opponents who have filed fundraising reports combined, according to FEC data. But she does know that, if she wins, she'll have a much tougher race to run.""We're going to need to raise two million dollars in the general,"" she says. ""This will be a challenge. We're rising to that challenge."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/19/595025070/sworn-to-secrecy-trumps-history-of-using-nondisclosure-agreements","President Trump may have brought one of his favorite tools for dealing with staff in the business world with him into the White House: confidentiality agreements.As a businessman, Trump routinely required employees to sign agreements promising not to reveal secrets of the Trump Organization. He did the same during his presidential campaign and the post-election transition period. And according to the Washington Post, Trump has imposed the same confidentiality requirements on some senior members of the White House staff.The administration took issue with the Post's story, which cited a draft version of a nondisclosure agreement that included a $10 million penalty for violators. That potential fine, at least, isn't correct, the White House said.""While nondisclosure agreements are commonplace and common practice for previous administrations, I can say the report that staff were required or asked to sign $10 million nondisclosure agreements is not true,"" White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters traveling on Air Force One. ""But past that, I can't get into security and obviously I can't get into that any further. ""Gidley added that he had not personally been asked to sign an agreement.""I've never seen one. I've never been asked to sign one. And I have never signed one,"" he said.Although nondisclosure agreements may be routinely used in the business world, critics say they have no place in the West Wing, where employees don't work for shareholders, but for the people of the United States.""Public employees can't be gagged by private agreements,"" Ben Wizner of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project said in a statement. ""These so-called NDAs are unconstitutional and unenforceable.""Trump has a long history of using nondisclosure agreements to protect secrets and discourage disparaging comments. In 2013, he successfully sued a Miss Universe contestant for $5 million after she complained publicly that the beauty pageant was rigged. Two decades earlier, Trump sued his ex-wife Ivana for allegedly violating the confidentiality agreement surrounding their divorce. That case was ultimately settled.Stephanie Clifford, an adult film actress who performs under the name Stormy Daniels, collected $130,000 in 2016 in exchange for her silence concerning an affair she allegedly had with Trump. Clifford's attorney has argued the agreement is nonbinding, but Trump's lawyer disagrees. Attorney Michael Cohen has argued that Clifford could need to pay at least $20 million in damages if she violates the agreement.As he campaigned for president, Trump said he imagined requiring White House staffers to pledge their secrecy.""When people are chosen by a man to go into government at high levels, and then they leave government and they write a book about a man and say a lot of things that were really guarded and personal — I don't like that,"" Trump told the Washington Post in 2016.Reporter Bob Woodward asked Trump if he thought such agreements were ""airtight.""""I think they're extremely airtight,"" Trump said. ""Let's put it this way: it's so airtight that I've never had ... you know, I've never had a problem with this sort of thing.""Woodward suggested it might be different in Washington.""The taxpayers are paying the other people in the federal government,"" he said.Federal employees and contractors who work with classified information are routinely asked to sign nondisclosure agreements. There's even a standardized government form for it: Form 312.But they're not always effective. A former Navy SEAL who took part in the raid that killed Osama bin Laden published a best-selling book about the operation. Threats of legal action by the Department of Defense only boosted readers' interest.Courts have sometimes refused to enforce nondisclosure agreements, especially in cases where the information sheds light on corporate behavior that might pose a threat to public health or safety.""The idea was, this isn't something that a company should be able to — by contract — hide from the general public,"" said law professor Jodi Short of the University of California's Hastings College of the Law.She added that nondisclosure agreements are generally governed by state law, so the rules can vary. But general principles of contract law dictate that employees can't be coerced into signing. And they must receive something of value in return for their silence, like the $130,000 paid to Clifford.A judge might be unwilling to nullify a nondisclosure agreement simply to satisfy public curiosity, Short said, if no broader health or safety issue were involved. But the power of such agreements to compel silence is limited.""You don't get put in jail for breaking a contract,"" Short said. ""All you have to do is pay damages. If you have enough money to pay damages, then nobody can stop you."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/19/594993409/supreme-court-delivers-blow-to-republicans-declines-to-take-up-pa-redistricting","Updated at 9:39 p.m. ETThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up a Republican challenge to the newly drawn Pennsylvania congressional map ahead of the 2018 elections.The decision means Republicans have few, if any, options remaining to try to stem a map that will almost certainly result in Democrats picking up potentially three or four seats and could make half a dozen or more competitive.Tuesday is the filing deadline for candidates for Pennsylvania's May 15 primaries.Last month, the Supreme Court also declined to block the state court decision that said the old GOP-drawn map violated the Pennsylvania Constitution.Republicans drew a gerrymandered map in 2011 that resulted in a 13-5 congressional district advantage. That was despite Democrats having won the state in five straight presidential elections at the time.Democrats need to win a net of 24 seats to win a majority in the U.S. House.The decision comes on the same day a federal court dismissed a lawsuit filed by Republican congressmen challenging the new map. It's a double gut punch to the GOP and all but guarantees that Democrats pick up a few seats, and in an election with control of Congress at stake, every seat counts.Legally, the challenge could also open the path to a slew of state court challenges. Challengers to the 2011 GOP-drawn map called into question its legality based on the state constitution, a rarity that could provide a road map for challengers in other states. The Supreme Court's decision Monday also shows a possible reluctance to weigh in on state law when it comes to redistricting.This is not the last say the Supreme Court will have, however, on redistricting. It is hearing arguments March 28 on a Republican challenge to Maryland's Democratic-drawn congressional map, and the court has a decision pending on a Democratic challenge to GOP-drawn state legislative districts in Wisconsin. Both cases deal with political rather than racial gerrymandering. While the court has ruled previously on racial gerrymandering, it has never ruled on political gerrymandering.The Supreme Court will hear arguments April 24 on racial gerrymandering in Texas as well. And the court also temporarily blocked a lower court's decision in a racial gerrymandering case in North Carolina ordering the state to redraw a map that was favorable to Republicans."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/19/594947772/hillary-clinton-drawn-into-2018-campaign-with-comments-about-trump-voters","Hillary Clinton has made her entrance into the 2018 campaign, but not by choice. The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee's name is nowhere on the ballot this year, but that's not stopping some Republicans from using her words, her image and her gaffes to energize the GOP base. At a conference in Mumbai, India, earlier this month, Clinton spoke candidly about her loss to Trump and made some controversial comments about his supporters, saying they were motivated by racial and gender intolerance.Clinton summed up Trump's argument, as she saw it. ""You know, you didn't like black people getting rights. You don't like women getting jobs. You don't want to see that Indian-American succeeding more than you are,"" Clinton said. ""Whatever your problem is, I'm gonna solve it."" Clinton apologized for her remarks in a lengthy Facebook post on Saturday, in which she said, ""I understand how some of what I said upset people and can be misinterpreted. I meant no disrespect to any individual or group.""But that's not stopping Republicans from running with her remarks. Clinton's comments were quickly seized upon by Republicans, eager to have one of their favorite foils back in the spotlight ahead of the midterms.And now a new ad from Missouri's attorney general Josh Hawley, the leading Republican in the race to challenge Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., for reelection, uses Clinton's ""backwards"" comments to suggest she other Democrats like McCaskill look down on Missourians. The state voted for Trump over Clinton in 2016 by about 19 percent. The ad begins with footage of Clinton in India describing her 2016 loss. ""If you look at a map of the United States, there's all that red in the middle where Trump won,"" she begins. The ad then shows McCaskill's early and enthusiastic support for Clinton. It continues with Clinton in India saying, ""I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic moving forward. And his whole campaign was looking backwards. You know, you didn't like black people getting rights, you don't like women getting jobs, you don't want to see that Indian-American succeeding more than you are, whatever your problem is ... He stirred that up"" The ad ends by declaring that ""this is what Claire McCaskill and 'her president' think of you."" Clinton is a potentially valuable asset for the GOP in a year when Democratic enthusiasm appears to be surpassing Republicans, in addition to House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. And Republicans are eager to suggest Clinton's comments are evidence of how Democrats are out-of-touch with middle America.     Many Democrats were quick to distance themselves from their party's 2016 nominee and her recent comments. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois said Clinton's comments about Trump voters were incorrect. ""My friend Hillary Clinton is wrong. Thirty percent of the people that voted for Donald Trump had voted for President Obama,"" Durbin told Fox News Sunday.Clinton's comments were reminiscent of one of her biggest missteps during the 2016 election when she described half of Trump's supporters as a ""basket of deplorables"" at a fundraiser. Clinton said they were ""racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic—you name it."" She later apologized for that criticism. But not before the Trump campaign had appropriated it. The campaign relished the ""deplorable"" label and used it as a badge of honor to remind voters of what Clinton thought about them.Clinton has largely stayed out of the limelight, and is reportedly planning a discreet midterm campaign strategy.

The president has discussed opioids repeatedly, including during a summit earlier this month, and has created a commission to tackle the issue. But many proposals remain in progress or unaddressed. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was in the audience as Trump spoke and applauded the president's focus on law enforcement.""At the Department of Justice, we have made ending the drug epidemic a priority,"" Sessions said in a statement. ""We will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate.""Trump conceded that not all Americans would be ""ready"" for such a crackdown, but he promised to push for it.""Unless you have really, really powerful penalties, led by the death penalty for the really bad pushers and abusers, we are going to get nowhere,"" he said.The president's plan also calls for expanded research into less-addictive pain killers and efforts to reduce the over-prescribing of opioids.Before the speech, the president and first lady visited a Manchester fire house where they met with first responders, who are often called upon to treat overdose victims.Trump praised the Adapt pharmaceutical company, which makes free and discounted samples of its anti-overdose medication, naloxone, available to schools and first responders.Every day, Trump said, 116 Americans die from an opioid overdose. He said the death rate in New Hampshire is twice the national average.""We will liberate our country from this crisis,"" Trump said. ""And we will raise a drug-free generation of children."""

You've heard of FLOTUS.But have you heard of BOTUS?That would be BUNNY of the United States. Real name: Marlon Bundo. Bundo for short.The little black-and-white bunny — named after Marlon Brando — belongs to Vice President Pence's daughter Charlotte and lives with the second family at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C.Monday, Bundo is out with his first book: Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President. It's published by the children's arm of Regnery Publishing, which specializes in conservative books.Technically, Bundo himself did not author this book — that was Charlotte (""Mom""). Second lady Karen Pence (""Grandma""), a former art teacher, did the watercolor illustrations. But Bundo is the star. In the book, he follows ""Grampa"" (Vice President Pence) around Washington — to meetings with the president in the Oval Office and to the Senate, and contemplates a painting of his home state of Indiana, and a Bible verse, Jeremiah 29:11: ""For I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.""Bundo got his name when Charlotte, then a film student, needed a rabbit to star in one of her movies, and brought him home. He was apparently a natural on camera, which is now paying off in his new role as celebrity pet.  He first appeared on the scene in May 2017, when the vice president and second lady brought him along to an event at the White House honoring military families. He immediately upstaged the Pences, especially among the younger crowd.At the time, Karen Pence told the kids gathered around, ""Marlon is kind of famous because he is the first bunny to ever ride on Air Force 2.""The bunny is also on Twitter (@realmarlonbundo — you'll know him by the telltale red baseball cap) and has more than 18,800 followers on Instagram.Given all of that, it's probably safe to say he's the most famous of the Pence family's pets, but he's not the only one. Bundo currently shares the vice presidential residence with a puppy and a kitten — Harley and Hazel — both adopted in recent months, after the Pences lost their beagle, Maverick; and two cats, Oreo and Pickle. There is also a snake named Sapphira.It remains to be seen whether Harley, Sapphira or Hazel will get books of their own.For now, it's Bundo who's hopping into the children's book world. He joins presidential pets Socks and Buddy, who also have a book — authored by then-first lady Hillary Clinton: Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids Letters To The First Pets.Proceeds from Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President will go to an art therapy program called Tracy's Kids and a nonprofit, A21, that's working to end slavery and human trafficking. It's unclear whether Marlon Bundo is going on the book tour, but he certainly seems eager to read the story of his adventures.Yet even Bundo has not escaped controversy. Sitting at the top of the Amazon Best Sellers list Monday was a parody of the Bundo book by HBO's Last Week Tonight with John Oliver (the original book is several spots lower on the list). Oliver's version ""explores issues of same sex marriage and democracy""; Pence has a history of criticism from the LGBT community and advocates. Proceeds from this book will go to The Trevor Project and AIDS United. In a statement to CNN, the publisher of Pence's book said, ""It's unfortunate that anyone would feel the need to ridicule an educational children's book and turn it into something controversial and partisan."""

Jerry Brown last year and became effective on Jan. 1, includes prohibiting state and local police agencies from informing federal authorities in cases when illegal immigrants facing deportation are released from detention.The vote caused diverse reactions among over 150 people participating in the council meeting.“They are asserting their right to ensure the constitutional remains the main law of the land,” Arthur Schaper, who supported the motion, told Fox Los Angeles.""The law is the law and has to be enforced all over the country,"" he told The Los Angeles Times. ""The country is a law-and-order country and you have to come here legally.""Others, upset that a council in California chose to decide whether to ignore state laws aimed at protecting illegal immigrants, showed up to protest the vote – causing a temporary delay.“What we don’t understand what we fear we kill. And that’s what we’re doing we’re killing the spirit of this nation which is American,” Joanne Abuqartoumy told the newspaper.The only dissenting voice on the council, Mark Chirco, wrote on Facebook after the vote that “I could not see how the ordinance proposed tonight would benefit our city” and will instead “place our city in danger of a costly and uphill battle with the State of California.”But many believe the example of the Los Alamitos Council may be a game-changer in California, where state officials have positioned themselves as against the immigration policies of the Trump administration.""We're just calling on the federal government to stand up on behalf of the city,"" she said, hoping the U.S. Department of Justice will support the city.The newly passed law will have to have a second reading in a month. It is expected that the ordinance will pass again.The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/19/are-some-states-headed-for-splitsville-movement-grows-to-allow-sections-states-to-break-away.html","When Donald Trump was elected, a lot of people in California signed a petition supporting the state’s secession from the U.S. It was hard to take the movement seriously—didn’t we fight a war over this?But there is another secession movement in California, and elsewhere in America, that is getting genuine attention from political pundits. While it may be unlikely to succeed, the idea of intra-state secession—a section of a state splitting off to form its own state—has been growing in popularity. And there’s even a Constitutional procedure for doing it.In recent decades, the political differences between rural areas and metropolitan areas seem to have become more severe. This has caused political splits in certain states, where, often, those rural areas, with lower populations, feel stifled by their city brethren.Kotkin feels this movement is driven by policies like the $15 minimum wage, “which makes sense in San Francisco, but doesn’t make sense in Fresno.”  He adds those running California are “fundamentally authoritarian” with “not a lot of tolerance for any kind of economic or political diversity.” As he puts it, their attitude is “’We know the truth, we know what’s right, and it has to apply to everyone.”This is why there’s a movement in New York for upstate to split from downstate.  As Republican state senator Joseph Robach puts it, “We’re completely overwhelmed...by the policies of New York City.” In 2009 and 2011 he introduced bills to hold a referendum on secession.  And in 2015 there was a rally in favor of carving out a new state, supported by more than a dozen groups frustrated by the policies of Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo.All this secession talk has captured the notice of University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds, who recently put out a new paper, “Splitsylvania: State Secession and What to Do About It.”He notes that Article IV, section 3 of the Constitution allows for new states to be admitted into the union, though no new state can be formed within an old state without the consent of the state legislature as well as Congress. That’s a pretty high hurdle. But, as Reynolds told Fox News, not insurmountable.It’s been done before, but long ago. For example, Vermont split from New York in 1791, Maine split from Massachusetts in 1820, and West Virginia split from Virginia during the Civil War in 1863. There haven’t been any states formed by secession in modern U.S. history.What’s more, Americans seem to have gotten used to the idea of 50 states, with Hawaii the last admitted to the Union in 1959. As Reynolds points out, “for most of the country’s history we added a new state every couple of decades...now we act as if 50 is set in stone. There’s a plausible argument that we would be better off with more states. It would be more representative.”While it would seem that state leaders wouldn’t want to give up power, Reynolds offers a scenario where politicians might greet the formation of a new entity. “If you’re a California politician, you spend a lot of time trying to fight your way to the top. And the trouble is it’s a really big state—there are a lot of other people trying to fight their way to the top...[If the state splits, there’s] a smaller pond, but you’re a big fish.”More important than forming new states, however, Reynolds feels we should address the disputes that make citizens support secession.  Part of the problem, he believes, goes back to the Supreme Court case “Reynolds v. Sims” (1964), which declared state legislatures (as opposed to the U.S. Senate) have to be apportioned according to population, not geographical area. As Reynolds explains, “under the old system, rural areas got more representation, and under the new system they got much less.”  This has helped lead to the present-day situation where rural areas feel underserved.Reynolds hopes there can be less dramatic solutions than secession, such as Congressional statutes (or in some cases executive orders) to ease the pressure. Reynolds thinks they have the Constitutional authority to remedy the situation, particularly under the Guarantee Clause, which states “The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.”Reynolds points to civil rights laws, passed to protect unfairly treated minorities, as a model for how Congress might take action.  He notes “most federal laws...are written to leave states the power to make stricter regulations, but if it seems like the burden...is falling disproportionately on a minority in a state that has no real political power...then I think it’s fair for the federal government to step in and protect them.” To Reynolds, this could mean laws limiting how far states can go regarding “the environment, firearms, wages and...things that people in rural areas are unhappy about.”This may seem like extreme intervention to some, but it’s a lot less extreme than secession.As Reynolds puts it, “when you have people talking about wanting to split from their state, and form a new one, there’s obviously some significant unhappiness, and if we can do things that are relatively low cost...to remedy it, I think probably we should.  At least we should think about it.”"
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/20/trump-rips-mueller-denounces-critics-escaping-his-cage.html","The firing of Andrew McCabe has opened the floodgates, both for President Trump and his media and political critics.The president is now denouncing Robert Mueller, and pundits and Democrats—with a sprinkling of Republicans—are criticizing Trump for what they view as open warfare against the FBI and the special counsel’s investigation.And this has spawned a broader media debate about whether Trump is now preparing to take unilateral action on a number of fronts despite the advice of top aides—and whether that could include firing Mueller.They coined a term for this behavior: Defiance disorder.The president now seems in full defiance mode as he gets rid of aides he no longer trusts and increasingly relies on his own instincts.The McCabe situation has been a Rorschach test for the press. The tone of the coverage—boosted by Trump spiking the football—is that his dismissal by Jeff Sessions hours before his retirement was a petty and politically motivated act.What has gotten less attention, except from conservatives, is that career prosecutors at Justice's Office of Professional Responsibility said McCabe should go both for leaking to the Wall Street Journal (debatable) and not being candid about it with investigators (a cardinal offense).White House lawyer Ty Cobb insists Trump has no plans to fire Mueller. But Trump's latest tweets about the ""witch hunt"" are fueling speculation: ""The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC.""For a year now, Trump's lawyers have been cautioning him to cooperate with the Russia probe and avoid attacking Mueller. But he is now breaking out of that box, and it's probably no coincidence that another of his lawyers, John Dowd, told the Daily Beast over the weekend that the Mueller investigation should be shut down.Maggie Haberman, the New York Times reporter who covered him in Manhattan for years—and has alternately drawn praise and criticism from Trump—writes that Trump's new assault on Mueller reflects ""a president who ultimately trusts only his own instincts, and now believes he has settled into the job enough to rely on them rather than the people who advise him.""A dozen people close to Mr. Trump or the White House, including current and former aides and longtime friends, described him as newly emboldened to say what he really feels and to ignore the cautions of those around him.""Given that Trump always trusts his instincts because he won a campaign that almost everyone thought he would lose, that does sound like what's happening now.The Times added that ""in his first year in the White House, according to his friends, he found himself feeling tentative and anxious, intimidated by the role of president, a fact that he never openly admitted but that they could sense, people close to the president said.""Some of Mr. Trump's allies have said that Mr. Trump was trapped in a West Wing cage built by Mr. Kelly, and has finally broken loose.""That was the word—""cage""—that some of his confidants used in the Reince Priebus days, generally when the president had bent the bars and escaped.The let-Trump-be-Trump camp knows that the president cements his ties to the base when he's roaming free and savaging his detractors. The question now is whether this keeps him in a different kind of cage, unable to break out with voters who remain skeptical of his unorthodox approach to the office."

McCabe, a regular target of President Trump's ire, has suggested that his departure was part of what he described as the administration's ""war on the FBI.""Speaking at Georgetown University, Holder accused Sessions of rushing to fire McCabe at Trump's behest.It may be that at the end of the day … [McCabe's] termination is appropriate,"" Holder said.

You run the damn Justice Department. You know? And you’ve got to have the guts to look at the president every now and again and say 'no.'""Trump had repeatedly condemned McCabe over the last year as emblematic of an FBI leadership he contends is biased against his administration. On Saturday, hours after McCabe was dismissed, Trump tweeted that it was a ""great day for Democracy"" and a ""great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI.""Holder said Trump's verbal assaults on McCabe were ""unconscionable"" and ""punching down.""Holder also gave his thoughts on special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials during the 2016 election.The former attorney general said it was ""entirely possible"" that Trump could order Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to fire Mueller.""I think this investigation’s proceeding along three tracks,"" Holder said. ""There’s the whole question of conspiracy – and stop calling it collusion. There’s no such thing as collusion – it’s conspiracy. There’s obstruction, and then there’s the question of what happened with the Trump businesses, enterprises, entities in Russia that I think Bob Mueller has to look at to try to, if nothing else, get context for the other parts of the investigation.""And I think it is that third strand that could lead the president to terminate Bob Mueller.""Trump has said that Mueller would cross a red line if the special prosecutor sought financial information from his family business.The Associated Press contributed to this report."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/20/supreme-court-should-not-allow-california-to-force-pro-life-pregnancy-centers-to-promote-abortion.html","What if the government required all Alcoholics Anonymous groups to recite an advertisement for a local bar before every single meeting? Imagine a group of people, struggling with alcohol abuse, trying hard to leave their addiction behind, being forced to endure a message about happy hour specials. And all this—delivered by an organization whose purpose is to aid people in overcoming alcohol dependency.You might wonder: How can a government force private organizations to speak a message that is directly at odds with their reason for existing? That would be ridiculous, right? This is exactly what California is requiring pro-life pregnancy centers to do. To make matters worse, only pro-life centers are subject to this law. Abortion providers are largely exempt from it. The state has decided to target pro-life centers simply because they speak a message that the state opposes. The Supreme Court has continually held that requiring citizens to speak a government-compelled message is held to the highest constitutional scrutiny under the First Amendment, because mandating a message necessarily alters the content of one’s speech. Moreover, the lopsided requirement that forces pro-life centers to speak the government’s message, while exempting pro-abortion speakers constitutes blatant viewpoint discrimination. This kind of message favoritism is routinely held to be unconstitutional. California attempts to justify its unconstitutional law by arguing that pregnancy centers are “deceptive” because they don’t offer or counsel for abortion. But the state never introduced any objective evidence to support the law. Pregnancy centers aren’t deceptive: They offer vital support, medical care, material assistance (such as diapers, clothing, and other baby supplies), and parenting classes to women who are experiencing an unplanned or crisis pregnancy. They do this because of their pro-life view, which supports both the woman and her unborn child. The state argues that abortion information is vital to pregnant women, yet the state does not even advertise these abortion services itself. Instead, they seem very concerned with getting the word out through the local pro-life pregnancy centers. The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, a member organization of pro-life pregnancy centers, as well as two pro-life pregnancy centers, challenged this law as a violation of the guarantee to free speech. A California federal court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit have both agreed with the state and allowed this unconstitutional law to stand. On March 20, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case and could reverse that within weeks. Courts have already declared similar laws in New York City; Baltimore; Montgomery County, Maryland; and Austin, Texas unconstitutional. Now the highest court in the land has the opportunity to invalidate these types of unconstitutional laws once and for all and protect the right of all citizens not to be forced to speak or promote messages that violate their beliefs."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/20/melania-trump-to-hold-first-public-event-on-cyberbullying.html","Amazon, Snap, Facebook, Google and Twitter are among the companies that are expected to attend the meeting. The Internet Association said it will also be represented.But the efforts so far have fallen short, leading to rampant abuses that even some of the companies acknowledge have driven away or tormented portions of their audience.It got so bad on Twitter, which has 68 million U.S. users, that the San Francisco company vowed last fall to crack down on hateful tweets. Among other things, Twitter adopted new policies aimed at protecting women who unknowingly or unwillingly had nude pictures of themselves distributed online -- a common bullying tactic.Online bullying takes many shapes, but some of the most common tactics include posting embarrassing or salacious photos, making demeaning or cruel remarks under a photo or in a general post about someone, and sharing screenshots of what at least one person thought was a private text.Harassment is widespread and extends beyond teenagers. A Pew Research Center poll last year found 41 percent of U.S. adults believed they had been harassed online.The popularity of and volume of content on major social media sites presents a huge challenge in policing what is being shared. Facebook, for instance, has 2.1 billion worldwide users who collectively share billions of posts on their pages daily.  More than 300 hours of video is uploaded to Google's YouTube site every minute.The companies are also constantly struggling to balance the desire to prevent harassment and other abuses and maintain a commitment to freedom of expression.In some cases, they see harassment and still look the other way. For instance, some of President Trump's more vitriolic tweets have openly mocked and denigrated people, prompting calls for Twitter to shut down his account and ban him from its service. But Twitter has declined, maintaining the news value of the president's tweets eclipse complaints about him being a bully.There is no federal law that applies to bullying. State laws vary, ranging from requiring public schools to have a bullying policy to requiring anonymous reporting systems, said Sameer Hinduja, co-director of the Cyberbullying Research Center and professor of criminology at Florida Atlantic University. The federal government can best help by giving schools more tools and money to provide programs, Hinduja said.Mrs. Trump announced in a speech near the end of the 2016 presidential campaign that her priority as first lady would be to fight cyberbullying. A native of Slovenia, she at the time lamented a U.S. culture that she said had grown ""too mean and too rough."" It was a curious speech for a woman whose husband uses Twitter to dismiss people as losers and taunt them with unflattering nicknames.The mother of a 12-year-old son, the first lady has made child well-being her focus in the White House, including an unexpected interest in how the opioid crisis is affecting youngsters.She has visited hospitals and care centers to see the effects first hand, and has embraced parents whose children died from drug overdoses. She accompanied the president to New Hampshire on Monday as he discussed a three-pronged effort to combat drug addiction, including applying the death penalty against those caught trafficking highly addictive substances.Mrs. Trump recently asked the spouses of U.S. governors to help promote values such as encouragement, kindness, compassion and respect in children. She has also spoken about limiting the amount of time children spend online, and helping them understand the content they are exposed to. "
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/20/cal-thomas-californias-pro-abortion-fact-act-is-attack-on-free-speech.html","On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments over whether pro-life pregnancy help centers in California should be required to post notices informing women of the availability of abortions elsewhere. The pregnancy help centers are contesting the law, disingenuously named the California Reproductive FACT Act, claiming it violates their free speech rights, as well as undercuts the reason for their existence.Some might ask in the interest of fairness and equality (two buzzwords the left likes to use in other situations) whether abortion clinics are required to post notices with information about alternatives to the procedure.According to Ingrid Duran, state legislation director for National Right to Life, the nation’s oldest and largest pro-life organization, “There is no provision in the California so-called Fact Act that would require abortion facilities to inform women about the resources available from pregnancy resource centers.” She adds, “It is not surprising that (the) pro-abortion lobby would threaten pregnancy resource centers that offer life-affirming alternatives, since this is in contradiction to their mission of the unfettered right to abort innocent unborn children.”It is the abortion industry, which makes money off these vulnerable women, that fears information, otherwise they would be posting signs in their facilities about alternatives and the kind of help available during pregnancy and after birth. The pregnancy help centers, unlike the abortionists, do not charge for their services, raising the question of who cares more about women?I once debated a liberal feminist about this. She said I was implying women aren’t smart enough to know what their choices are. I replied, “Fine, then let’s remove the labels from packaged products because women should be smart enough to figure out whether they contain corn or green beans.”If information is power, then we who are pro-life should favor more information, not less, so that the choices women make will be fully informed. This would include, in addition to information about pregnancy help centers, sonograms so that a woman seeking an abortion could see what she is about to terminate.I have heard stories of women who have viewed sonograms of their babies deciding against abortion. Many more view the sonograms and go through with the procedure. But if a sonogram will save even one life, shouldn’t we make them mandatory before abortions can be performed?That is a law that should be passed. By providing a full spectrum of information, such a law would empower women to make fully informed choices. It would be far better than the California FACT Act, which undermines the compassionate (and free) work of that state’s pregnancy help centers."

Occasionally this relationship goes beyond respect and develops into genuine friendship; a friendship which, in turn, extends to close families.We – the recent professional heads of the armed forces of the U.S., the United Kingdom and France – are fortunate enough to enjoy such a relationship.In part, our friendship derives from the fact that in recent times we often shared, with each other, the otherwise lonely burden of our national responsibilities. In particular, those responsibilities that involved the custodianship each of our nation’s military capabilities and our professional duty to advise our governments on the threats we faced and the risks we ran.The first concern is the need to recognize that the world has, quite suddenly, become a less certain, less stable and more dangerous place. The symptoms of this are easy to see: terrorism, mass migration, revanchist states.The second concern adds to the danger of the first. There appears to be a continuous decline in the effectiveness of international institutions. This creates an absence of empowered mechanisms by which to resolve these global problems; a lack of appreciation that it is only through collective action that, in a dynamic and changing world, stability can be sustained while beneficial change is accommodated.And our third concern completes the piece. A lack of commitment to collective and collaborative leadership means that there is an absence of any truly effective international will to resolve these global challenges. International leaders look increasingly inward, their focus firmly on domestic popularity. Yet the nature of power is changing, and the desire to remain “in control” is producing sub-optimal, expensive, temporary solutions to our problems.   Although we’re sure our successors would appreciate a bit more support and predictability in the budgeting process within each of our countries, none of what is written above is an appeal for defense spending or military solutions. Indeed, the best way to enhance military capability is through alliances built on trust. And the worst way to solve global challenges is to militarize them.All we wish to emphasize is the very grave risk that now exists to global security unless the dangers are recognized, leadership steps forward with an instinct to be inclusive, and collective solutions are identified.General Pierre De Villiers was the Chief of the general staff headquarters of the French Armies from 2014-2017.

Kamala Harris (D-CA), an avid open borders advocate, is praised in the latest edition of American Vogue by illegal aliens for being the illegal alien population’s “strongest ally.”Harris’s new profile in Vogue focuses much of its attention on her fight to give amnesty to the 12 to 30 million illegal aliens currently living in the U.S. – especially those who have been shielded from deportation by the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.The California Senator is particularly beloved by the open borders lobby and illegal aliens because she, herself, is the daughter of two foreign-born residents of the U.S. Her parents met while they were graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley.During one instance in the Vogue profile, ahead of the President Trump’s State of the Union (SOTU) address, a DACA illegal alien told Harris “you’re my Beyoncé.”The meeting ends. Before Harris heads to the Capitol, she must first stop by her office to welcome the date she’s bringing along, a DACA recipient named Denea Joseph, who emigrated from Belize at the age of seven and grew up in South Los Angeles. (She cofounded a Facebook group called “Slay, Kamala, Slay.”) At Harris’s office, Joseph is waiting on a beige couch, wearing a graphic-print blouse, black slacks, and heels. Harris settles down next to her while an aide runs through Joseph’s lineup of media interviews. “It’s about you, but it’s not about you,” Harris says to calm her nerves. “Think of all the people who are counting on you to deliver your message.” Before they leave, Joseph asks to take a selfie with the senator. I pretend not to be listening as Joseph, fumbling with her phone, tells Harris: “You’re my Beyoncé.” [Emphasis added]It’s not just DACA illegal aliens who fawned over Harris for the Vogue profile. Pro-mass immigration elected officials in California called Harris their “strongest ally” in the fight to crush Americans’ wages with a never-ending flow of mass low-skilled immigration.Plenty of national politicians wax poetic about Dreamers. Few can defend them with Harris’s command. “She’s the strongest ally we have in the fight,” says Eric Garcetti, the two-term mayor of Los Angeles, the city with the most Dreamers in it. At the same time, Harris has signaled that she won’t support a fix that comes with hard-line anti-immigration measures. For months, she has been pushing for a “clean” Dream Act—legislation that would offer DACA beneficiaries a path to citizenship, but would do so without being tied to other policies, in particular funding for Trump’s border wall. [Emphasis added]Harris’s open borders views have most recently been reflected when she said she “100 percent” supported a decision by Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf (D) to help criminal illegal aliens evade deportation ahead of a raid by federal immigration officials, Breitbart News reported.‘Important Alert!’: Oakland Mayor Warned Businesses with Illegal Alien Employees Before Announcing ICE Raidhttps://t.co/H1mDcERhpo— John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) March 15, 2018During a fundraiser for the YMCA’s “Y for Youth Luncheon,” Harris defended Schaaf, who made national headlines last month when she warned criminal illegal aliens of a coming raid in Oakland by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.Subsequently, Schaaf helped many criminal illegal aliens with sex crime convictions, drunk driving convictions, and armed robbery convictions escape arrest and deportation.Harris defended Schaaf, saying “I think Mayor Schaaf is doing exactly what she believes is in the best interest of her community, and I support that 100 percent,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The liberal senator said the Trump administration was attempting to “roll back the clock” by enforcing federal immigration laws.Most recently, Breitbart News exclusively reported how the sanctuary state policies of California — supported by Harris — is likely responsible for at least 5,000 crimes that were committed by criminal illegal aliens who were released by the state rather than being handed over to ICE agents for deportation.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/19/chicago-sun-times-praises-prohibition-era-gun-controls-that-dont-stop-school-shootings/","The Chicago Sun-Times is praising prohibition era gun controls that are still in place and have failed to stop school shooting after school shooting and mass public attack after mass public attack.The piece of legislation in view is the National Firearms Act (1934). It was technically put in place a year after prohibition ended, but it was crafted in response to the 1929 Valentine’s Day Massacre, which resulted from tensions between Al Capone and Bugs Moran.The Sun-Times observes:The original National Firearms Act imposed a tax on the making and transfer of certain firearms, as well as a special (occupational) tax on persons and entities engaged in the business of importing, manufacturing, and dealing in NFA firearms. The law also required the registration of all NFA firearms with the secretary of the Treasury. Firearms subject to the 1934 act included shotguns and rifles having barrels less than 18 inches in length, certain firearms described as “any other weapons,” machineguns, and firearm mufflers and silencers.The Sun-Times describes NFA as “surprisingly effective and non-controversial.” They note that “in 1986, Congress strengthened the NFA definition of ‘silencer’ by adding combinations of parts for silencers and any part intended for use in the assembly or fabrication of a silencer.”They then use the NFA as a blueprint for other gun controls that are currently being pushed, especially gun controls relating to school shootings. The problem with this suggestion is that it overlooks the fact that the NFA has not prevented mass public attacks from occurring. Moreover, it has not prevented school shootings from taking place either.In fact, if the prevention of such attacks is the measurement, the NFA has failed in every way, except for where it relates to giving money to the government via the federal tax on NFA-regulated items.Think about it—How many firearm-based mass public attacks have occurred since NFA was passed in 1934? How many attacks have occurred on schools? Here is a short list of mass public attacks and school attacks during the last 19 years:Seven individuals were killed in the 1929 Valentine’s Day Massacre. Many times that number have been killed in the numerous attacks which the NFA has been powerless to prevent.Thirteen were killed at Columbine, 32 were killed Virginia Tech, 12 were killed in the Aurora movie theater, nine were killed at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal, nine were killed at Umpqua Community College, 14 were killed in San Benardino, 49 were killed in Orlando, 26 were killed in the Texas church, and the list goes on.If NFA proved impotent to stop these attacks–which only represent attacks during the last 19 years–how can it be held up as a gun control to emulate going forward?AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

The Lincoln Bible had been used for President Lincoln’s swearing-in ceremony in 1861.Trump carried the Bible—which his mother Mary Anne gave to him—to his Sunday School classes at First Presbyterian Church in Queens, New York.“My mother gave me this Bible, this very Bible, many years ago,” Trump said in a campaign video from Trump Tower. “In fact it’s her writing right here. She wrote the name and my address, and it’s just very special to me.”The Museum of the Bible placed the president’s Bible alongside the Bibles of several other presidents—including Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush—in the museum’s “Bible in the World” exhibit on the second floor.The D.C.-based museum opened to the public in November.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/20/sessions-gives-nod-trumps-drug-dealer-death-penalty-already-law/","Attorney General Jeff Sessions stood by President Donald Trump in Manchester, New Hampshire, Monday as the president announced his new strategy to tackle the opioid crisis, including seeking the death penalty for certain drug dealers.“At the Department of Justice, we have made ending the drug epidemic a priority. We will continue to aggressively prosecute drug traffickers, and we will use federal law to seek the death penalty wherever appropriate,” Jeff Sessions said in a statement after he appeared with Trump.Trump’s support for executing drug dealers, citing the success of the policy in more authoritarian regimes, created a huge splash. But the death penalty is, theoretically, already on the books for certain “drug kingpins” who traffic in quantities on the order of hundreds of kilograms of heroin or cocaine, due to a 1988 law that was expanded in 1994. There is also a multitude of state and federal statutes that allow for the death penalty for drug dealers when someone dies as a result of using their wares.As a practical matter, however, no one has ever been sentenced to death under any of these laws. They are likely unconstitutional under current Supreme Court precedent. In 2008’s Kennedy v. Louisiana, the High Court found it a violation of the Eighth Amendment’s ban on “cruel and unusual punishment” to execute a man convicted of raping, but not killing, a child. The case built on 1977’s Coker v. Georgia, which found the same for an adult rapist.The strong implication of these and other Supreme Court cases is that the death penalty in the United States is only constitutional for murder and possibly for crimes against the state, such as treason, espionage, and desertion in wartime. In Kennedy, the second category was not addressed, and it was not decided whether “drug kingpin activity” could be considered a crime against the state. (Justice Samuel Alito’s dissent argued it was arbitrary to consider it one.) Regardless, changes on the Supreme Court since 2008 could potentially mean the constitutionality of the death penalty’s use for offenses other than murder or crimes against the state will be revisited.The last time any jurisdiction in the United States executed someone for a crime other than murder was 1964 when Alabama electrocuted a man convicted of robbery and Missouri gassed another for rape. Soviet spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, electrocuted for conspiracy to commit espionage in 1953, were the last non-murderers executed by the federal government.Theoretically, however, United States’ attorneys, acting under the direction of the attorney general, could seek the death penalty for top-level drug dealers without any further legislation from Congress.Sessions was broadly supportive of  Trump’s opioid plan, which includes a new anti-drug advertising campaign and wider distribution of the lifesaving anti-overdose drug, Narcan, in high schools and universities. He explained:Drug dealers show no respect for human dignity and put their own greed ahead of the safety and even the lives of others. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent and deadly business: if you want to collect a drug debt, you collect it with the barrel of a gun. As surely as night follows day, violence and death follow drug trafficking, and murder is often a tool of drug traffickers.…I want to thank the president for his strong leadership on this issue, and I join him in sending the message that business as usual has ended.It remains to be seen if the Trump administration will seek new legislation to support the plan to execute what the president described as “dealers and pushers.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

The U.S. Department of Justice is challenging SB 54 as one of three “sanctuary state” laws that, it claims, violate the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.Members of the city council were concerned that SB 54 required them to violate their oaths of office, which require them to uphold and defend the Constitution. Although legal experts say that there is a chance SB 54 will survive in the courts — since unlike the other two law it merely requires state and local government not to assist federal law enforcement, while the other two laws interfere with federal authority — city council members were still concerned,The Orange County Register notes that the city council debate on Monday evening was intense on both sides:While the crowd had dwindled both in and outside the chamber when the vote came, people erupted in cheers after the vote and began chanting “USA.” But on the pro-immigrant rights side, there was this chant: “The people united, will never be divided.”Someone shouted out to Councilman Warren Kusumoto, who introduced the legislation, “great American patriot!” while someone else screamed out “America first.”…Throughout the night, many in the crowd of more than 150 people from Los Alamitos, Long Beach and other communities engaged in heated debate – sometimes in front of the dais, other times with each other.Separately, Register also reported that Kusumoto was particularly concerned that SB 54 would require him to disobey the Constitution: “California legislators are bulling local elected officials into violating our oath of office,” he said.The council also voted to direct the city attorney of Los Alamitos — the county’s second-smallest city — to prepare an amicus brief on the side of the Department of Justice in its case against the State of California.Joel B.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/california/2018/03/20/jerry-brown-blasts-critics-of-high-speed-rail-costs-bullsht/","California Governor Jerry Brown blasted critics of his cherished high-speed rail project in a speech to labor leaders in Sacramento on Monday: “This is bullshit … “I’m so tired of all the nonsense that I read in the paper and you hear from other politicians.”Brown, according to the Los Angeles Times, was furious at recent news reports of the rising cost estimates and vowed that the project will be built with federal dollars once Democrats re-take control of Congress following the 2018 midterm elections.“People say, ‘How are you going to fund the railroad? … I’ll tell you how we’re going to fund the railroad. We’re going to take back the Congress and then a Democratic Congress is going to put the high-speed rail in the infrastructure bill and then we’ll get that trillion dollars and we’ll put America back to work.”Republicans have blocked funding to high-speed rail projects in California and other states, after Democrats passed such funding in the ill-fated “stimulus” bill of 2009. The Obama administration attempted to bully states into spending the money, with then-Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood threatening recalcitrant states with the loss of stimulus funds. Several called his bluff rather than face potentially crippling long-term costs for unproven projects.The recent alarm over rising high-speed rail costs comes was not raised by journalists or politicians, but by the California High-Speed Rail Authority itself. As Breitbart News reported Sunday:California’s bullet train appears to have released a “High Case” estimate of $98.1 billion to prepare the public for much higher tunneling costs.Breitbart News reported on March 9 that the California High-Speed Rail Authority’s (CHSR) new chief program officer, Roy Hill, had issued a 114-page “2018 Draft Budget” with a “Base Case” cost to build the 500-mile bullet train that had more than doubled to $77.3 billion, or $155 million per mile.That compared to the $37 billion, $74 million-per-mile plan that Gov. Schwarzenegger and other advocates claimed when they convinced voters to pass Proposition 1A in 2008.CHSR’s first comprehensive financial review in a decade acknowledged, “The worst-case scenario has happened.” But CHSR — for the first time — included a “High Case” estimate that warned costs could spike to $98.1 billion, or $196 million per mile.Brown insisted to labor leaders that the high-speed rail project would solve many of the state’s problems, including the lack of available low-cost housing in coastal cities — presumably by allowing workers to live in the interior of the state and commute to the coast.Joel B.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/20/sen-grassley-real-estate-lobbies-block-eb-5-chinese-visa-reform/","Two New York lobbying groups are using their Democratic allies to block a bipartisan reform this month of the scandal-plagued, EB-5 citizenship-for-sale program, says Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.Grassley declared Monday:The American people understand that our citizenship is a blessing, and shouldn’t be given away cheaply. Unfortunately, for too many years this body has witnessed the perversion and degradation of a program that sells, yes sells, our citizenship … in the last decade this program has been hijacked by big-moneyed New York City real estate interests. These developers now take almost all the foreign investment from this program, and for the last few years they’ve actively prevented this body from enacting any reforms …Today, I’m calling on the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader [Sen. Chuck Schumer], and all my colleagues who value the integrity of our lawful immigration system to stand with me and end the regional center program.The American people deserve better than this. Our citizenship means more than this.The two business groups can block the reform from being added to the March 23 omnibus bill because they are backed by top Democrats — chiefly, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. The groups are the Real Estate Roundtable and Related Companies.“Schumer is beholden to the New York real-estate interests which contribute to his campaign and he will not do anything they won’t sign on to,” said a Hill source.Grassley has long led a campaign against abuse of the EB-5 program, an effort that took on a new dimension last summer when presidential son-in-law and White House Advisor Jared Kushner’s family business, now run by his sister Nicole Kushner Meyer, was caught using the program in their advertising to attract Chinese investors. Grassley later pushed for a fraud investigation into the practice, but the Kushner Companies were still reportedly using the EB-5 hook, along with “Mr. Perfect” Jared’s supposed White House clout, in China as late as July.The current program allows foreign governments to sell U.S. citizenship to its friends, Grassley said.There’s no prohibition against foreign governments owning or operating regional centers or projects. That’s right, foreign governments can own businesses that sell our citizenship. Think about that … There are no required background checks on anyone associated with a regional center. One need to look no further than the indictment last September of two Chinese fraudsters who stole more than $50 million in foreign investment and managed to sell U.S. citizenship to individuals on the Chinese government’s most wanted list.Grassley continued:I’m talking about the EB-5 Regional Center Program. For years, I’ve been fighting in a bipartisan way to reform this corrupt, scandal-clad program. I’ve been fighting to protect our national security, to ensure foreign investment is going to the most deserving areas, and to make sure that American citizenship isn’t sold at rock bottom prices in order to feed the addiction of New York interests to cheap money. But, no matter how hard I’ve fought, each and every time we’ve tried to reform this program these same moneyed interests have used their political influence and political connections to block any meaningful reforms.This is sickening, and it’s exactly why most American people question Washington, D.C.After more than three years of trying to fix this broken, scandal-plagued program, I’ve finally come to the conclusion that it can’t be fixed. And since it can’t be fixed, the EB-5 Regional Center Program needs to be terminated.﻿The real-estate groups defend the program, which allows foreign investors to effectively buy green cards and citizenship for themselves and their families by investing only $500,000 in the United States. The program is mostly used by wealthy Chinese, most often by investing in new real-estate construction brokered by one of many EB-5 Regional Centers.For example, if 100 Chinse investors unite to fund a real-estate program, they provide the developers with a $50 million fund to borrow construction loans that will be eventually repaid by the people who buy or rent the new buildings.But the program is also used by corruption groups around the country. In South Dakota, for example, it was used to build an overpriced slaughterhouse that only produced a scandal.Breitbart reported:Ariel Quiros, the man behind the now infamous investment project in Vermont’s Jay Peak ski resort, had his assets frozen last year when it became clear he was effectively using the project to solicit investments from foreigners hoping for EB-5 green cards and then misusing the money, allegedly including $50 million for personal expenses.In January, a massive real estate investment fraud was unearthed in New York enticing foreigners, mostly Chinese, to invest in the hopes of securing EB-5 visas.Last month, raids were conducted in California in relation to another alleged $50 million investment fraud that attempted to get EB-5 visas for Chinese, including several of the most-wanted criminal fugitives in China. According to the China Daily, three of the 100 most-wanted public corruption and bribery fugitives, including one facing a potential death penalty, invested in the Los Angeles-area-based real estate scheme.Grassley declared in his speech:Several years ago, I started working with then-Ranking Member Leahy on reforms to the EB-5 Regional Center Program. Through the hard work and dedication of our staffers, we discovered the program is riddled with fraud and corruption, and poses a real and serious threat to our national security. Among other things, we discovered that:Investments can be spent before business plans are approved.Regional Center operators can charge excessive fees of foreign nationals in addition to their required investments.None of the jobs created have to be “direct” or verifiable jobs but rather are “indirect” and based on estimates or economic modeling. Again, not knowing for sure if jobs are created.Investment funds from foreign sources are not adequately vetted.Gifts and loans from anyone are acceptable sources of funds from foreign nationals.There’s no prohibition against foreign governments owning or operating regional centers or projects. That’s right, foreign governments can own businesses that sell our Citizenship. Think about that.Regional centers don’t have to certify that they comply with securities laws.There are no required background checks on anyone associated with a regional center. One need to look no further than the indictment last September of two Chinese fraudsters who stole more than $50 million in foreign investment and managed to sell U.S. citizenship to individuals on the Chinese government’s most wanted list.Gerrymandering continues and rural and urban distressed areas lose out.There’s no transparency on how funds are spent, who is paid, and what investors are told about the projects they invest in.And the list goes on and on and on. I could speak for hours about the corruption in this program.Faced with this appalling list of fraud, corruption, and national security loopholes, for three years I’ve been working with Senator Leahy and our counterparts in the House of Representatives to produce real EB-5 reform. Our staffers have spent countless hours, nights, and weekends meeting with congressional colleagues and industry stakeholders to hammer out a compromise that is fair to all sides. But our offers have constantly been rejected by big moneyed industry interests every single time. This time has been no different.For the last year, my staff, along with Chairman Goodlatte, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Flake’s teams, has worked around the clock to produce an EB-5 reform package. Everyone made numerous concessions in order to reach a deal, and after more than twenty meetings and countless hours of drafting, we produced a reform package that was fair.Our reforms would have reauthorized the Regional Center Program for six years, providing the certainty that industry has long said it craves. We would have permanently set aside 3,000 visas for rural and underserved urban areas, and would have increased the minimum investment amounts to $925,000. In recognition of longstanding industry concerns, we agreed to reduce the investment differential between non-priority areas and priority areas to a mere $100,000. Finally, we would have implemented a host of integrity measures that would have cracked down on investment fraud, foreign corruption, and bad business practices.Our reforms had the unanimous support of Invest in the USA, the largest EB-5 trade association. Our reforms had the support of the EB-5 Rural Alliance, a group working to ensure that rural America has a fair shake at attracting EB-5 money. But, these reforms weren’t acceptable to the big moneyed New York industry stakeholders who currently dominate the program. And because big money interests aren’t happy with these reforms, we’ve been told they won’t become law.Let that sink in for a minute. In spite of the fact that reforms were agreed to by Congressional offices and had the support of the largest EB-5 trade association, they won’t become law because a few EB-5 businesses with a lot of money have used their political connections and influence to block them.As I said at the beginning of this speech, I’ve finally realized this program cannot be reformed. The Regional Center program is simply too corrupted to be saved, and it needs to be ended.Today, I’m calling on the Majority Leader, the Minority Leader, and all my colleagues who value the integrity of our lawful immigration system to stand with me and end the regional center program.The American people deserve better than this. Our citizenship means more than this.Ian Mason contributed to this piece.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Because always, even behind the not-so-good things, there is something that will get us to some truth.”Pope Francis has often weighed in on issues affecting young people and modern culture, insisting that the Church be open to where people are.Last March, however, the pope warned youth to beware of the falsehoods behind much of social media and “reality shows,” urging them to live their own lives and to create their own histories.The pope’s Message for World Youth Day 2017 contained a lengthy commentary on the hi-tech world in which young people are immersed, comparing the memories of their personal experiences with the computer hardware that stores large quantities of data.“Yet our memories should not remain crammed together, like the memory of a hard drive,” Francis said. “Nor can we archive everything in some sort of virtual ‘cloud.’ We need to learn how to make past events a dynamic reality on which to reflect and to draw lessons and meaning for the present and the future.”He was quite critical of attachments to social media and so-called reality shows, warning youth that virtual friendships and virtual reality often conceal many falsehoods and are no substitute for real interpersonal experiences.“In the social media, we see faces of young people appearing in any number of pictures recounting more or less real events, but we don’t know how much of all this is really ‘history,’ an experience that can be communicated and endowed with purpose and meaning,” Francis said.The pope has made extensive us of social media during his five-year pontificate, and a 2015 study proclaimed him to be the most influential person on Twitter for the third year in a row.Yet in spite of his own success with social media, he remains skeptical of its real influence.“Television is full of ‘reality shows’ which are not real stories, but only moments passed before a television camera by characters living from day to day, without a greater plan,” he said in his message to the young. “Don’t let yourselves be led astray by this false image of reality! Be the protagonists of your history; decide your own future.”Follow Thomas D. Williams on Twitter Follow @tdwilliamsromeMOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

The battle claimed the lives of 687 men, including the five Sullivan brothers from Waterloo, Iowa. The lost souls became navy heroes and epitomized the service, sacrifice and dedication to freedom of the greatest generation.R/V Petrel, which was acquired by Microsoft co-founder and investor Paul Allen and fitted with subsea equipment capable of diving to 6,000 meters, located the cruiser on March 17 – St Patrick’s Day – about 2.6 miles below the surface.An underwater video image shows a propeller, part of wreckage from the USS Juneau. (Paul Allen)“We certainly didn’t plan to find the Juneau on St. Patrick’s Day. The variables of these searches are just too great,” said Robert Kraft, director of subsea operations for Paul Allen. “But finding the USS Juneau on Saint Patrick’s Day is an unexpected coincidence to the Sullivan brothers and all the service members who were lost 76 years ago.”The USS Juneau had a short service history, only being commissioned just under a year prior to it sinking.Just a few minutes into the Battle of Guadalcanal, Juneau was hit by a Japanese torpedo on the port side near the forward fire room. The shock wave from the explosion buckled the deck, shattered the fire control systems, and knocked out power.WWII ship USS Juneau located by #RVPetrel on St. Patrick’s Day—unexpected coincidence since she is best known for the Sullivans, all 5 brothers were lost, along with the other 682 sailors.

It was later revealed approximately 115 of Juneau‘s crew survived the initial explosion and took to the water, including possibly as many as two of the five Sullivan brothers.Exposure, exhaustion, and shark attacks whittled down the survivors and only 10 men were eventually rescued from the water eight days after the sinking.The Sullivan brothers on board the USS Juneau, 14 February 1942 From left to right: Joseph, Francis, Albert, Madison and George Sullivan.

The five sailed aboard ship despite the naval policy that prevented siblings from serving at sea together. The brothers refused to serve unless assigned to the same ship and the policy was ignored.Expeditions funded by Allen have resulted in the discovery of the USS Lexington, the USS Indianapolis, the USS Ward, the USS Astoria, Japanese battleship Musashi and the World War II Italian destroyer Artigliere. MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

According to Moore, the teacher’s group scored an “amazing victory” which “brought down the state’s apparatus,” and resulted in a 5 percent pay increase.But while addressing Sanders directly, Moore complained that he “didn’t see hardly anything” in the “corporate media” about the demonstration.“Bernie, I didn’t see hardly anything in the corporate media about this, on any of the networks, even some of the networks that we watch were you know—Russia, turn the channel, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia,” the Oscar-winner said. “I’m not saying that’s not important.”To which Sanders replied: “Talk about Stormy Daniels.”The Fahrenheit 9/11 director went off, blasting the media for obsessive coverage of stories such as Russia, Stormy Daniels, and Donald Trump Jr’s divorce.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/20/new-york-times-proposes-taxing-beef-combat-climate-change/","The New York Times has proposed a special tax on the beef industry to compensate for the alleged damage Big Beef has caused to the environment by provoking climate change.In his March 17 op-ed titled “The Case for a Carbon Tax on Beef,” Richard Conniff argues that it is time to break off “our collective love affair with beef” because the cattle industry “has a larger impact on the environment than that of any other meat or dairy product.”Mr. Conniff admits that he got the idea for a special beef tax from the French, which should already give any serious person pause. The French notoriously address every possible problem by taxing it to death, so that only the rich can avail themselves of the finer things in life.Last May, former President Barack Obama warned the world that eating meat was causing a dramatic rise in climate emissions.“People aren’t as familiar with the impact of cows and methane,” Obama said at a food innovation summit in Milan, adding that “as people want to increase more meat consumption, that in turn is spiking the growth of greenhouse emissions coming out of the agricultural sector.”The growing demand for beef as people get wealthier is contributing to global pollution, Obama said, alluding to the amounts of methane gas emissions from cow herds.“No matter what, we are going to see an increase in meat consumption,” Obama said, pointing to developing economies in China, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam. More advanced countries, Obama said, would have to teach people to “have a smaller steak” and explore reductions to their meat consumption.In his Saturday op-ed, Mr. Conniff said that the agriculture sector is the third-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, after the energy and industrial sectors. Citing Chatham House, the British think tank, Conniff said that raising livestock accounts for 14.5 percent of global emissions, “more than the emissions produced from powering all the world’s road vehicles, trains, ships and airplanes combined.”Among all livestock, cattle raised for beef and dairy products account for almost two-thirds of all livestock emissions, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, he said. The 1 billion to 1.4 billion cattle worldwide—at some 1,300 pounds apiece—means that “their footprint on the planet easily outweighs ours.”In the fall of 2016, Michael Battaglia warned in an article in The Conversation that because of the methane produced in cows’ stomachs, cow belching is a much bigger problem even than the occasional flatulence that was thought to be so detrimental to the environment. “Despite misconceptions, most cow methane comes from burps (90%) rather than farts (10%),” he said.To justify the need for a massive carbon tax on beef, Mr. Conniff apes the “widely regarded” (though completely unsubstantiated) belief that global warming must be kept to under 2 degrees Celsius, since at that critical point “cascading and potentially catastrophic effects of climate change could sweep across the planet.”As an important counterpoint, Scientific American published an essay in early March urging people to “chill out” over climate change, because doomsday scenarios attributed to global warming are simply false.The essay, penned by John Horgan, the director of the Center for Science Writings at the Stevens Institute of Technology, analyzed two reports by “ecomodernists” who reject climate panic and frame the question of climate change and humanity’s ability to cope with it in radically new terms.One of the reports, a work called “Enlightened Environmentalism” by Harvard iconoclast Steven Pinker, criticized “the mainstream environmental movement, and the radicalism and fatalism it encourages,” arguing that humanity can solve problems related to climate change the same way it has solved myriad other problems, by harnessing “the benevolent forces of modernity.”The second report is a recent article by Will Boisvert titled “The Conquest of Climate,” which contends that the “consequences for human well-being will be small” even if human greenhouse emissions significantly warm the planet.Undaunted, Mr. Conniff declares that a carbon tax on beef would be “only a little painful,” since people could learn to skip the beef and “substitute other meats, like pork and chicken, that have a much smaller climate change footprint.”In the end, one remains with the lingering suspicion that rather than addressing real problems, the left feels compelled to invent false ones, for the simple pleasure of proposing how government can tell people how to live.Social engineering never truly dies.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/california/2018/03/20/howard-jarvis-gas-tax-repeal-has-3-4-signatures-with-30-days-to-go/","An effort to repeal California’s new gas tax repeal has collected three quarters of the required signatures, and has 30 days to gather the last 200,000 to place an initiative on the November ballot.The Reject The Gas Tax referendum, sponsored by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, has received substantial bipartisan voter support towards gathering the 587,407 California signatures from valid registered voters that are legally required to place an initiative on the ballot.California’s Democrat-controlled legislature claimed that “The Road Repair and Accountability Act” of 2017 (SB-1), which they passed almost a year ago, would provide $5 billion per year to address significant funding shortfalls to maintain the state’s multimodal transportation network as the “backbone of the economy and critical to quality of life.”But advocates of the gas tax were silent on how the regressive measure would hammer middle-income and lower-income families. The average California family of four is now paying about $300 more per year in gas taxes and fees and will pay about $400 more in 2019, along with an additional $50 in gas taxes for each year thereafter.Progressives understand that after California Gov. Grey Davis increased car registration fees in 2003 by a similar $263 per year, voters retaliated by recalling the Democrat governor and sweeping Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger into office.The latest non-partisan Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) Statewide Survey poll reveals that 61 percent of Republicans, 52 percent of Independents, and 39 percent of Democrats favor repealing the gas tax. Given a big pro-repeal advertising blitz in the fall, Californians interested in dumping the tax will be motivated to show up to vote their economic interest.Over 80 percent of California communities favor dumping the gas tax, including 67 percent of the Inland Empire; 63 percent of the Central Valley; 58 percent of the Los Angeles Basin; and 58 percent of Orange County/San Diego. The only major support for the regressive tax comes from the San Francisco Bay Area, where 52 percent favor keeping the tax.Voters were told that the SB-1 gas tax would provide funds to repair state and local roads, bridges, and highways. But an estimated $750 million of SB-1 cash is being siphoned off each year for public transportation projects and operating expenses. Almost half of that cash is being steered toward funding California’s infamous high-speed rail train service.Breitbart News reported on March 9 that the California High-Speed Rail Authority’s new chief program officer, Roy Hill, had issued a 114-page “2018 Draft Budget” with a new “Base Case” cost to build the 500-mile bullet train that had more than doubled to $77.3 billion, or $155 million per mile. But Hill also warned that the “High Case” cost estimate for the so-called bullet train could triple to $98.1 billion, or $196 million per mile.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

One Nebraska Democrat running for Congress told the outlet that the “advice everybody gives” to candidates when they visit D.C. is: “Don’t say you’re for Pelosi.”Pelosi’s allies believe her fundraising prowess will ensure that she wins back the Speakership if Democrats take back the House. But her detractors have pointed out that Democrats like Lamb who are able to raise millions online without Pelosi’s help will not owe her anything.Pelosi, though, exuded nothing but confidence last week when reporters grilled her about her future as the party’s leader in Congress.“I feel pretty confident about my ability to, first and foremost, be a master legislator for the good of the American people. I have proven that,” Pelosi said last week. “I have a strong following in the country, and I don’t think that the Koch brothers should decide who the leader of the Democratic Party is in the House.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/19/washpo-factchecker-backtracks-on-crime-illegal-immigrants/","The Washington Post‘s deputy “Fact Checker” has retreated from his strange claim that President Donald Trump’s comments on illegal-immigrant crime are misleading because crime by the combined population of illegal and legal immigrants is apparently low.“Fact Checker” Salvador Rizzo wrote March 15 that:President Trump has a habit of linking undocumented immigrants to grisly crimes when, in fact, most of the available data and research say immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the U.S.-born population.Based on that lede, Rizzo ended his column by saying:This is another example of Trump cherry-picking a few cases to sell a grand — and misleading — narrative about immigrants and crime. Every demographic group has its share of criminals, but the research shows that immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than the U.S.-born population.For feeding this misleading narrative, Trump earns Four Pinocchios.Reader objections forced him to beat a quick retreat. Via Twitter, Rizzo quickly admitted the distinction between legal and illegal immigrants:Seeing a lot of, “Oh, you’re conflating legal and illegal immigrant crime data!” No nationwide data to support Trump’s claims as to illegal immigration, and most of the research says all immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born.Seeing a lot of, ""Oh, you're conflating legal and illegal immigrant crime data!""No nationwide data to support Trump's claims as to illegal immigration, and most of the research says all immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born.https://t.co/MLUJRQowwN— Sal Rizzo (@rizzoTK) March 15, 2018In a January Fact Checker article, the Washington Post author did the same trick of conflating crimes by illegal migrants and crime by legal immigrants to slam Trump’s criticism of crime by illegals — even as he also praised Trump for not conflating the two categories:When we fact-checked him as a candidate in 2015, Trump spoke of immigrants generally and without distinguishing between legal and unauthorized residents. But in his most recent statements on Dec. 6, the president narrowed it down to “illegal immigrants … bringing with them crime, tremendous amounts of crime.” …The majority of the research available on this question continues to show that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born and that overall crime rates decline in areas where immigrants settle.After his March column appeared, March, Rizzo responded to questions from Breitbart News by simply denying that he had commingled the two categories of immigrants:We did not. We accurately restated our finding from the previous fact-check that most research shows crime is lower among legal/illegal immigrants.But his March “Fact Checker” lede does conflate the population of legal immigrants and of illegal migrants:President Trump has a habit of linking undocumented immigrants to grisly crimes when, in fact, most of the available data and research say immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the U.S.-born population.Rizzo has a second line of defense. He argues that his March “Fact Checker” article is OK because it “focused on violent crimes because that was the subject of the president’s remarks.”Trump’s remarks did focus on violent crime, but he also began his remarks by talking about all crime by illegals:Protecting the safety and well-being of American Citizens is my highest duty as President. Yet, lawless sanctuary jurisdictions are nullifying federal law, obstructing immigration enforcement, and releasing thousands of criminal aliens into U.S. communities to prey on innocent victims. It’s absolutely terrible.Rizzo’s “violent crime” sidestep is hidden in the article, which does not say that the WashPo is excluding analysis of the non-violent legal violations and crime committed by illegals. Those violations and crimes include being in the country illegally, using other people’s Social Security Numbers, or working illegally — often for wages below what Americans need for a decent life.Rizzo does this violent-crime sidestep multiple times in the March article to help him criticize Trump’s comments about all crime by illegals. Here’s one example:“California’s leaders are in open defiance of federal law,” Trump said in his weekly address. “They don’t care about crime. They don’t care about death and killings. They don’t care about robberies.”The president paints a menacing picture, but the bottom line is that there is no evidence any of the seven individuals he mentions committed a violent crime while ICE was searching for them. The White House said their release by local authorities meant “more crimes being committed,” but the information they provided does not bear that out for violent crimes.Rizzo’s third line of defense is that Trump supposedly is misleading the public because he does not have good data from federal and state authorities to support his statements about crime by illegal immigrants. But there is plenty of evidence in the poor federal data, from common sense and from good data in Arizona that crime by illegals is much higher than crime by native-born Americans.In Arizona, the state tracked the native or illegal status of criminals as they were jailed. Researcher John Lott used the data to show that illegals committed more than twice as much crime per person as similar-aged native-born Americans, and that legal immigrants have a low crime rate.In January, Rizzo tried to dismiss Lott’s Arizona report by saying it is unique and yet also an “outlier” among other reports. Rizzo downplayed the Arizona report, he told Breitbart News, because the pro-migration Cato Institute “has called [the report’s] methodology into question.”The Cato Institute declared:According to Lott, the data allowed [Lott] to identify “whether they [the prisoners] are illegal or legal residents.” This is where Lott made his small error: The dataset does not allow him or anybody else to identify illegal immigrants …Lott erroneously assumed that the third category, called “non-US citizen and deportable,” only counted illegal immigrants. That is not true, non-US citizen and deportable immigrants are not all illegal immigrants.Lott’s Crime Prevention Research Center responded to Cato in February:This is wrong. The category “non-US citizen, deportable” only includes illegal immigrants. We followed the guidance given to us on how to separate these groups out as given to us by the Arizona County Attorneys’ Association, particularly Bill Montgomery, who represented the association and is the DA for Maricopa County, which has about 60% of Arizona’s population. He told us that a pre-sentencing report is used to determine citizenship.Fourthly, Rizzo’s “Four Pinocchios” claim implies that the president — and the public —  should wait for perfect data before making any conclusions about crime by illegals.But this is a political demand for progressive rule by experts or judges because it denies Americans the right to make a reasonable and conditional judgment — outside the courtroom, amid imperfect information — that young male migrants from some of the most violent countries on Earth should be viewed as more violent than Americans.A 2013 report by the United Nations showed the murder rates in the largest cities of the migrants’ home countries;So Rizzo is throwing “Four Pinocchios” at Trump’s comments about crime by illegals — even though Rizzo is improperly conflating crimes by illegals and legals, hiding many non-violent crimes committed by illegals, dodging Lott’s data, and issuing a fatwa on common sense. Why is Rizzo trying to do all of this under the supposed authority of a mere Washington Post “Fact Checker”?When asked by Breitbart News “Do you wish to minimize barriers against the movement of foreign people into the United States?” Rizzo replied, “The Fact Checker takes no position on the matter.” Americans’ common sense says otherwise.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Orrin Hatch (R-UT).“Romney announced a run for the seat on February 16, 2018,” Ballotpedia reported:“I am running for United States Senate to serve the people of Utah and bring Utah’s values to Washington,” he said on Twitter. President Donald Trump endorsed Romney on February 19, 2018. . .Hatch said in March 2017 that Romney “would be perfect” to replace him.Utah Republicans will take the first step in selecting their party’s nominees for federal offices, including the U.S. Senate, as well as state offices, when local GOP caucus meetings convene around the state Tuesday night to select 4,500 state delegates who will meet on April 21 in the party’s nomination convention.If one candidate receives 60 percent of the vote at the convention, he will be named the party’s nominee without a subsequent primary election. If no candidate receives that level of support, the top two candidates qualify to compete in the Republican primary, which is scheduled for June 26.In the 2010 nominating convention, an insurgent Mike Lee, backed by Tea Party activists, finished in the top two, edging out incumbent Sen. Robert Bennett (R-UT), who finished third and was knocked out of the race. Lee won the subsequent primary by a 51 percent to 49 percent margin and cruised to a victory in the November general election.Thanks to a controversial law passed in 2014, SB 54, candidates have another method now for getting on the ballot if they fail to finish in the top two: gathering signatures on petitions. For U.S. Senate candidates, the number of signatures needed is about 28,000.Most polls show Romney with a substantial lead among potential GOP candidates. But how well that lead in the polls will translate into the selection of nominating convention delegates at the GOP caucus meetings Tuesday night, and their subsequent votes at the April 21 nominating convention, is an unknown.Unlike the late Sen. Bennett, who had no way onto the ballot after he failed to finish in the top two at the 2010 nominating convention, SB 54 provides Romney with another way to get onto the June 26 primary ballot in the event he fails to make the cut at the nominating convention, and he is taking advantage of that option.“Romney is also gathering signatures to ensure he will appear on the primary ballot, but said he is using only volunteers to gather them — not paid firms,” the Salt Lake City Tribune reported.On Sunday, Bateman released a phone message, which he says was left by Weiler, as Salt Lake City’s KUTV reported:“It’s a filthy attempt to extort me,” said Batemen of the recording, which has the voice of state Senator Todd Weiler (R-Davis County).“I was trying to help someone I was told was being sexually harassed at work,” responded Weiler, who once served as vice chair of the Utah Republican Party.Here’s the backstory.Bateman, who is divorced, hired a girlfriend to work for him at Entrata. They broke up, and Bateman said Weiler tried to use the broken relationship to “smear” him.Weiler spoke to a confidante of the ex-girlfriend at a Jazz game in January and said he was told by the confidante—who is also a friend of the Weiler family—that Bateman’s ex-girlfriend had her job hours and responsibilities changed at Entrata, after the break-up. Weiler said he was told the ex-girlfriend looked for an attorney to file a sexual harassment case against Bateman, but that lawyers turned her down.A couple days later, Weiler called the confidante, and said this:“It’s Todd Weiler. Hey, at the Jazz game you were talking to some of my very well connected friends, and now I have another friend who’s a lawyer who thinks he could get your friend a million dollars if she doesn’t go to Europe. I think you know what I mean. Give me a call so we can talk.”Bateman said Weiler’s phone message “was part of a move to discredit him over his outspoken efforts to keep the caucus-convention system as the only way for GOP candidates to get on primary ballots. State law, known as SB 54, gives candidates the option of collecting signatures instead, something strongly opposed by at least a faction—and perhaps a majority—of party loyalists.Conservative grassroots activists in Utah–and other states, like Virginia–have long preferred the caucus system over the primary system, as it gives less weight to money and more to personal engagement.Then, in 2013, a group of Democrats and moderate Republicans launched the County My Vote direct primary initiative to end the caucus and convention nominating system in Utah.In February 2014, Romney announced his support for that effort as the Salt Lake City Tribune reported:“I want to tell you that Ann and I are supporters [of the County My Vote initiative]. Since the election, I’ve been pushing hard for states to move to direct primaries,” Romney wrote in an email last week to former Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt. “Caucus/convention systems exclude so many people: they rarely produce a result that reflects how rank-and-file Republicans feel. I think that’s true for Democrats, too.”In March 2014, the Count My Vote initiative “delivered an official letter of withdrawal to Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, formally concluding its statewide citizens’ initiative petition.” The action came after “the Utah Legislature passed and Gov. Herbert signed Senate Bill 54.”But last year, in the midst of the ongoing Utah Republican Party legal challenge to SB 54, the Count My Vote initiative started up again, this time focused on completely destroying the caucus and convention system and replacing it with a direct primary.“The Count My Vote ballot initiative would dump the traditional caucus-convention system as a path to the ballot, contending it allows a few party delegates — who often tend to be far right or left extremists — too much power to choose nominees,” the Salt Lake City Tribune reported in October:Count My Vote Executive Director Taylor Morgan noted his group had gathered 105,000 signatures in 2013 to allow voters to dump the caucus-convention system. But it withdrew its petitions to allow compromise legislation, SB54, in which candidates may qualify for a primary either by collecting signatures or through the caucus-convention system.“We withdrew our initiative last time in good faith that the Legislature would uphold the deal going forward,” he said. “But it’s been nonstop threats legally, politically and legislatively ever since” seeking to return to the old system in which anyone who won 60 percent of convention delegate votes became the nominee.State Senator Weiler told Red Meat Radio in October, “I’m not someone who’s pushing this [Count My Vote] initiative at all … I think it’s likely to pass next year.”“My prediction is it will be on the ballot for sure. I think out of all the initiatives it is the most likely to pass because it will be one of the best funded,” he added.“I think when all is said and done the public will view the [Republican] Party as having breached the agreement first by filing the lawsuit and trying to punish the people who collected the signatures. I think that’s what the average voter will see,” Weiler concludedThe controversy surrounding the dispute between Bateman, a champion of the grassroots who support the caucus and convention nominating system, and Weiler, perceived by the grassroots as anything but a supporter of the caucus and convention nominating system, is expected to be a topic of discussion at Tuesday evening’s GOP caucus meetings in Utah – one that may influence the selection of delegates to the April 21 nominating convention.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/19/pro-mass-immigration-billionaire-koch-brothers-side-with-dems-lobby-trump-to-accept-expansive-amnesty/","Pro-mass immigration GOP mega-donor billionaires, the Koch brothers, are siding with Democrats and demanding President Trump take a deal in which a border wall is fully funded in exchange for a large-scale, expansive amnesty with no immediate benefits for American workers.The Koch brothers’ organizations — including Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners, and the Libre Initiative — have sided with Democrats on the immigration front, lobbying Trump to take a deal that would flood the U.S. labor market with at least nearly two million legalized illegal aliens.For months, sources told Breitbart News that the Koch brothers — who have gone so far as to release an ad campaign in which they call illegal aliens “patriots” — were pushing the Trump administration to accept an amnesty deal that would allow at least 1.8 million illegal alien enrolled and eligible Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients to permanently stay in the U.S.According to a POLITICO report, the Koch brothers, through their organizations, are urging Trump to do just that:But the Koch groups — Libre Initiative, Americans for Prosperity and Freedom Partners — are all advising the president to take the Democrats’ deal. Brent Gardner, a government affairs official for Americans for Prosperity, called the proposal “an offer all parties should immediately accept,” and Libre Initiative’s president, Daniel Garza, said that “Congress and the White House should seize this chance.” [Emphasis added]Nathan Nascimento, an executive vice president at the Freedom Partners chamber of commerce, said, “If a deal was on the table that offered both security at the border and permanent status for Dreamers, that’s a deal that Republicans, Democrats and President Trump should support.” [Emphasis added]Trump, however, has remained clear that he would not accept a deal giving DACA illegal aliens amnesty unless it included a reduction to legal immigration levels — wherein the U.S. imports more than one million legal immigrants every year — to raise the wages and quality of life of America’s working and middle class.The Koch brothers have been adamant in their support for mass immigration, announcing last month their opposition to Trump’s popular, pro-American effort to end the process of chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S.By opposing the end to chain migration, the Koch brothers support the current legal immigration system which imports more than a million mostly low-skilled workers who compete directly with the country’s poor and working-class or blue-collar American jobs. https://t.co/EBAr2JClHj— John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) February 2, 2018Daniel Garza of the Koch brothers’ LIBRE Initiative told Fortune at the time:We cannot support arbitrary cuts to future legal immigration levels. We welcome a debate about whether our current legal immigration policy properly balances family and skills-based migration. But that broad debate should not distract from the immediate goal of providing certainty to Dreamers and enhancing security. [Emphasis added]Chain migration has imported about 9.3 million foreign nationals to the U.S. since 2005. In that same time period, a total of 13.06 million foreign nationals have entered the U.S. through the legal immigration system, as every seven out of ten new arrivals come to the country for no other purpose than to reunify with foreign relatives.This makes chain migration the largest driver of immigration to the U.S. — making up more than 70 percent — with every two new immigrants bringing seven foreign relatives with them.The billionaire Koch brothers have also, most recently, railed against Trump’s pro-American tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, calling them “crony capitalism,” as Breitbart News reported.The Kochs are deeply out-of-touch with Republican voters and Trump’s base of populist supporters. Most recent polling found that Republican voters now see reducing overall immigration to the U.S. as a larger priority than repealing Obamacare, tax cuts, and destroying the Islamic State (ISIS).Poll of Republican Voters: Reducing Immigration More Important than Replacing Obamacare, Destroying ISIShttps://t.co/CD9WsH7zVw— John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) February 22, 2018A DACA amnesty, such as the one for which the Koch brothers are lobbying, would come at the expense of American citizens, while being an immediate benefit for big business and illegal aliens.For example, a DACA amnesty would put more citizen children of illegal aliens — known as “anchor babies” — on federal welfare, as Breitbart News reported, while American taxpayers would be left with, potentially, a $26 billion bill.Additionally, about one in five DACA illegal aliens, after an amnesty, would end up on food stamps, while at least one in seven would go on Medicaid.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

That’s approximately one-quarter of one percent.The first television ad that Lamb ran touted his time in the Marines and that he “still loved to shoot,” according to the Washington Post. After the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, Lamb walked a line between support for stricter background checks and hesitation about new gun laws.Just one week later, the Congressional Leadership Fund sent some Democrat voters in Allegheny County ads painting Lamb as “supporting our second amendment rights” and “opposing gun restrictions.”The Post report didn’t detail the full reach of the ad. A spokeswoman with CLF told Breitbart News that “These mailers went to 12,000 anti-gun Democratic women who were 90% less likely to support Conor Lamb after hearing his views on gun restrictions.”The mailer was message tested before distribution and claims that it definitely cost Lamb votes, according to the PAC. The PAC also maintains that it was the first to go into the PA-18 race and spent over three and a half million dollars there.“Our job was to make sure voters in Pennsylvania knew where Lamb stood on important issues and that’s why this mailer was sent to those who would find his second amendment stances of note,” CLF spokeswoman Courtney Alexander told Breitbart News on Friday.Many locally elected Democrats in the district oppose abortion and gun control, according to the Post. While there are more registered Democrats than Republicans, President Donald Trump won the district in 2016 by 19 points.Due to redistricting, whoever ultimately comes out victorious in the PA-18 race will not run for re-election, but would have to run again in a different district.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/19/democrats-in-disarray-unsure-whether-to-push-amnesty-or-shutdown-agenda/","Democrats are in disarray over the issue of immigration, as the caucus finds itself split between more moderate members and the open borders component of the party.When it comes to demanding amnesty for illegal aliens shielded from deportation by the President Obama-created Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Democrat leaders are giving up on trying to shut down the federal government by holding up the upcoming spending bill unless DACA amnesty is included.Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-MD) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), for example, say shutting down the government to get DACA amnesty in the upcoming spending bill is not the Democrats’ plan.The Hill reports:“I think that’s probably the best policy for us to do,” said Rep. Steny Hoyer (Md.), the Democratic whip. “It’s also politically the most feasible way to get an omnibus passed.”…“There’s not a whole lot of reason to negotiate – to do anything that is not already covered by the court decision,” Pelosi said Thursday.“It is necessary for us to pass [the omnibus] to defend our country, to invest in our children’s future, to keep America number one in every respect, to do so in a way that creates jobs,” she added.Likewise, amnesty’s biggest defender in the Senate, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), told Fox News Sunday that there would be no shutdown effort on behalf of the Democrats when it comes to the spending bill..@SenatorDurbin tells Chris: Congress is not going to have a shutdown over #DACA pic.twitter.com/XvYL6JQOaN— FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) March 18, 2018Durbin said:We’re not going to have a shutdown, but I’m urging the leaders to basically come together and understand there is an emergency at hand here. 780,000 young people have their lives hanging in the balance because President Trump killed the DACA program. We have to move on a bipartisan basis to put it back in business. [Emphasis added]On the other hand, not all Democrats are sticking to the plan.For example, pro-open borders Rep. Luis Gutierrez has signed onto a letter, along with 83 fellow Democratic congressmen, in which they demand that the upcoming spending bill include an expansive amnesty that would give the majority of the 12 to 30 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. a pathway to citizenship.Thank you to my colleagues for getting the message out: 83 Democrats Demand #DreamAct Be Added to Omnibus & That Funding for Deportations, Detention & Walls Be Stripped: https://t.co/QjL63jKIke #twill #heretostay #DefundHate #Chicago— Luis V. Gutierrez (@RepGutierrez) March 15, 2018Gutierrez’s demands do not stop at a large-scale amnesty for illegal aliens. The group of Democrats also demand the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lose funding for their efforts to enforce federal immigration laws and drop all funds that would go towards constructing a wall along the southern border to stop illegal immigration.Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), a prominent defender of open borders in the Senate, has hinted at only supporting a spending bill that includes amnesty for illegal aliens.Trump created the Dreamer crisis when he ended DACA. We must continue to fight for the thousands of young people whose lives were thrown into chaos by this decision and give them the security they deserve.— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) March 14, 2018Regardless, a DACA amnesty would come with tremendous costs for American citizens.For example, a DACA amnesty would put more citizen children of illegal aliens — known as “anchor babies” — on federal welfare, as Breitbart News reported, while American taxpayers would be left with, potentially, a $26 billion bill.Additionally, about one in five DACA illegal aliens, after an amnesty, would end up on food stamps, while at least one in seven would go on Medicaid.Any plan to give amnesty to DACA illegal aliens that does not also include provisions to halve legal immigration levels — the U.S. admits more than one million legal immigrants a year at the expense of America’s working and middle class — would give amnestied illegal aliens the opportunity to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country.At the southern border, a DACA amnesty has the potential to trigger a border surge that could triple the number of illegal aliens pouring through the border. Since DACA’s inception, more than 2,100 recipients of the program have been kicked off because they were found to be either criminals or gang members.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Susan Collins (R-ME).Congress must pass the omnibus spending bill before midnight Friday or the government will shut down.The proposed bailout package would include Obamacare’s cost-sharing reduction subsidies for three years and funding a federal reinsurance program for three years in exchange for increased flexibility for states through federal waivers. The program would also expand eligibility for Obamacare “copper” plans.The removal of the Obamacare bailout proposal deals a blow to Sen. Collins, who secured support from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to support the bailout measure in exchange for her vote for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December.House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-OR), a supporter of the proposed bailout measure, said on Monday night, “They’re not in there at this point, and that’s unfortunate. We’re going to see what we can do moving forward, perhaps in the Senate.”Sens. Mike Lee (R-UT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), as well House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) and Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) wrote an op-ed last week urging fellow lawmakers to end any potential Obamacare bailout.The conservative lawmakers wrote in their op-ed why they oppose funding the CSR program, as well as a federal reinsurance program:Before now, Republicans correctly saw CSR payments for what they were – flagrant bailouts of favored ObamaCare insurance companies – and refused to be complicit in that bailout.Republicans also recognized that CSR payments lacked sufficient pro-life protections, allowing taxpayer funding for abortions. These problems with CSR payments still remain – but the attitude among some Republicans has strangely and suddenly changed.The reinsurance program proposals under consideration today would create a new backdoor bailout similar to one originally found in Obamacare.In contrast, Lee, Cruz, Meadows, and Jordan argue that Republican lawmakers should focus on expanding health savings accounts (HSAs), allowing Americans to purchase more affordable health plans, and making health plans portable between jobs.“These three simple things will go a long way toward promoting market competition that benefits consumers and reduces the cost of health care for everyday Americans,” the conservatives explained.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Another told Reuters, “It was almost like, ‘Well, thank you and let’s move on to the next person.’”Reuters portrayed the claims as a major scoop in a Sunday report, strongly implying Sessions would face problems because he told the House Judiciary Committee under oath, “Yes, I pushed back,” when he was asked if he “pushed back” on Papadopoulos’s suggestion. Press outlets further to Reuters’s left quickly latched onto the report, seeing it as a major break in the “Russia Investigation.”All three unnamed sources are said to be cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. No indication is given as to why all three decided to go to the press two years after the meeting and four months after Sessions testified before the House Judiciary Committee.Meanwhile, a source who went on the record, Trump campaign Director of National Security J.D. Gordon, stood by his earlier account, backing Sessions’s claim he “strongly opposed Papadopoulos’ proposal.”Democrats and left-leaning commentators have repeatedly tried to put Sessions in jeopardy over minor discrepancies in accounts he has given Congress regarding meetings with Russians during the 2016 campaign. Sessions neglected to mention two brief encounters with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak during his confirmation hearings for the attorney general’s spot. He has since vigorously combated Democrats’ efforts to portray that fact as evidence of deliberate deception or collusion with Russia.To evaluate this latest claim – that Sessions may merely have ignored Papadopoulos rather than countered him in front of the 2016 meeting – Reuters interviewed two solidly liberal law professors: George Washington University’s Jonathan Turley and Pace University’s Bennett Gershman. Both were reluctant to say Sessions could face perjury charges, even if the three sources’ claims were entirely true.Turley indicated that Sessions’s statement he “pushed back” might, in Reuters’s words “be too vague to form the basis of a perjury case because there could be different interpretations of what he meant.” Gershman noted how difficult it was to prove perjury, but thought it might be possible in this case. “Proving there was intent to lie is a heavy burden for the prosecution. But now you have multiple places where Sessions has arguably made false statements,” he told Reuters.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2018/03/19/jeanne-ives-momentum-race-governor-illinois/","According to a recent poll, Republican gubernatorial candidate for Illinois Jeanne Ives is moving closer to incumbent Gov. Bruce Rauner (R-IL) ahead of next Tuesday’s primary to determine the GOP’s nominee for the Prairie State’s governor. While previously trailing Rauner by double digits, Ives now trails by seven points: 42 to 35 percent.Ives shared her views on the race during a Thursday interview on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight with co-hosts Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak.Ives warned against Republican renomination of Gov. Bruce Rauner (R-IL) in Illinois’s GOP gubernatorial primary scheduled for March 20. Democrats will secure Illinois’s governorship if Rauner is the Republicans’ gubernatorial candidate in November, she predicted.“Rauner, we know, can’t be elected in 2018,” said Ives:We know that already. Anybody who elects him, or votes for him on March 20th really is sealing the fate of the state of Illinois, because if you put a Democrat in there in 2018, it’s lights out in the state of Illinois. … The guy has spent four, five, six million dollars lying about me and he’s getting away with it. … That’s why he’s going to lose in November — because nobody trusts him. Democrats, Republicans, and independents don’t trust Bruce Rauner. That’s why if he were to win on March 20th, he loses in November.Ives noted the tightening of polls between herself and Rauner:At the start of January, we were probably down 45 points on Governor Rauner because he has a $100 million worth of name ID over the last three years of being an incumbent. The guy is super wealthy [and has] been able to get his message out all the time, even when he first got elected in 2014 and then continuing on. … Good news is, we’re now within seven points. … We think we’re within five points, so that puts us almost within the margin of error.Ives described Rauner as a “fake” Republican who had deceived Illinois’s conservatives: “We decided to mount this challenge because, when fake Republicans betray us, if they’re not challenged, then they’re getting away with something and we couldn’t let that happen. Not in this state, not in this time; 2018 has to be a change election in the state of Illinois.”Pollak drew parallels between Rauner’s governorship in Illinois and that of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s in California.“[Bruce Rauner] has been a disappointment to voters who thought he would bring reform to Illinois, and we have seen this pattern before,” stated Pollak. “Here in California, Arnold Schwarzenegger came in in very similar fashion to Rauner, an outsider with a lot of money to spend, took over state government, and could not work with a Democratic legislature to get anything done. Rauner has basically been the same and worse because he has folded on core Republican priorities, like abortion, like immigration.”“[Bruce Rauner] didn’t even do the things that he could do as governor correctly, which is run the agencies well, and take on public corruption,” said Ives. “You don’t need the Democrats approval ahead of time to do either one of those, so the guy has been a complete failure.”Pollak noted the Democratic Governors Association’s recently published ad critiquing Ives as the “most conservative” candidate in Illinois’s gubernatorial race.“They certainly come at you pretty hard in this ad,” commented Pollak. “They see that you’re a threat and you could be the candidate in the general election.”Mansour mocked the Democrats’ strategy of critiquing Ives as “too conservative” prior to the GOP gubernatorial primary.“I’m fascinated about the way that the Democrats are playing these ads because I’ve seen before where they sometimes think that … they might even be trying to fool the Republican base into supporting the candidate that they’re attacking by showing how conservative you are and thinking that you’re going to be the weaker candidate,” said Mansour. “Are they that stupid, is what I want to know. If they are that stupid that they think you’ll be weaker in a general election, it just makes this even more delightful, don’t you think? Because you’re going to run circles around this guy. That’s why I’m like, please get her in the general election because it’s going to be epic. That’s why I think this is so wonderful. They might be completely underestimating you.”Pollak also noted Rauner’s poor performance against Democratic rivals in recent polls.Nearly 90 percent of Illinoisans view their state’s management as on the wrong track, shared Ives, pointing to a recent poll in which 84 percent of poll respondents described the state of Illinois as “off track and heading in the wrong direction.”Pollak described Illinois’s state management as in dire straits: “The state’s economy is basically migrating out of Illinois. It’s moving to Wisconsin and Indiana. … Illinois just has not so many problems, and Bruce Rauner has really struggled, and worse than that, he has abandoned his voters.”A recently published study ranked Illinois at the top of all states — including Washington, DC — “in terms of the severity of its overall tax burden.”“This is a classic case where you have an insurgent campaign,” said Pollak. “Most insurgent campaigns fall short, but occasionally they topple the champion, and that’s what happened with Dave Brat taking on Eric Cantor in Virginia. … You are really a star candidate, West Point graduate, Army veteran, served the country overseas and served three terms in state legislature. You have the resume, the skills, the poise, and the temperament.”Mansour described Ives as possessing “courage and integrity.” “That is the only way that Chicago, and Illinois, is going to get out of this mess, is with somebody with courage and integrity to do what has to be done,” said Mansour.“We’re talking about the Ives of March,” quipped Ives, inviting Illinoisans to support her bid for Illinois’s governorship.Breitbart News Tonight airs Monday through Friday on SiriusXM’s Patriot channel 125 from 9:00 p.m. to midnight Eastern (6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. Pacific).LISTEN:Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

It was loaded down with limestone headed for Cleveland when a storm took it and the eight lives aboard, among them, the captain and his wife, as well as their nine-year-old son.The National Museum of the Great Lakes has reported its discovery by shipwreck hunter Rob Ruetschle, who began his search for the missing vessel more than 30 years ago. But searching Lake Erie is no small feat: While it is the both the warmest of the Great Lakes, as well as the smallest by water volume, it also freezes much more often than any of the others.Furthermore, despite its aforementioned volume, it still covers nearly 10,000 square miles of surface area. Finding anything — even the potential thousands of shipwrecks beneath its oft-frozen waters represents a worthy challenge for even the most diligent hunters.Lake Erie is a fickle mistress at the best of times. The same sudden violence with which storms tend to hit its waters has proved as much an obstacle to the shipwreck hunters as the original voyagers. And while anywhere from hundreds to thousands might be down there somewhere, David VanZandt of the Cleveland Underwater Explorers asserts that the group “[keeps] knocking those off and the list is getting shorter.”Ruetschle himself describes the experience of finding the Margaret Olwill as “sort of like climbing Mount Everest for the first time.” While he no longer resides in Ohio, he returns there in the summer to continue his searches.

According to research by the Welch’s company, the moms in your life are putting in even more time than you might suspect. A survey of 2,000 mothers across the nation reveals a work week that starts at an average of 6:23 AM every day and does not end until approximately 8:31 PM.Of course, most salaried employees manage a day or two off in the midst of the grind — moms, however, do not. That seven-day total comes out to an average 98 hours per week, or the rough equivalent of two and a half careers worth of labor. Furthermore, the average mother finds a mere hour and seven minutes to herself each day — little more than a single lunch break.Welch’s Health and Nutrition Lead Casey Lewis said, “The results of the survey highlight just how demanding the role of mom can be and the non-stop barrage of tasks it consists of,” and the moms agreed. An average of four in 10 expressed the feeling that their lives were “a never-ending series of tasks.”New mothers amplify this to an extreme that makes maternity leave sound more like sentencing. To top it all off, over 60% of mothers under 50 years of age are also part of the professional workforce. Tired yet? Hopefully not, if you are a mom. According to fitPregnancy, you will average a microscopic one to three hours of undisturbed sleep in those pivotal early days (months, years) of your offspring’s new life.Of course, no mom is without a Batman-esque array of tools to ease the burden. According to the survey, the most important items for holding it all together are naps, toys, wet-wipes, drive-through meals, babysitters, family help, and maybe a bit of wine.Oh, and coffee. Lots, and lots of coffee.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/19/city-richmond-school-safety-resolution/","A proposed City of Richmond School Safety resolution asks Congress to ban “large-capacity ammunition cartridges.”The proposed resolution also calls on Congress to “ban the manufacture, sale, purchase, possession, and use of assault weapons.”It also asks to implement “universal background checks.” Such checks would require a background check for a private sale just like the background check currently required for a retail purchase. Ironically, almost every high-profile firearm-based attacker acquires his or her gun via background checks at retail sales, so such an expansion would do nothing to prevent future attacks.To date, attackers that do not acquire firearms via background checks most often get their guns via thievery. For example, the Parkland, Florida, school attacker passed a background check for his rifle, while the Sandy Hook Elementary attacker stole his guns. Universal background checks would not have prevented either attack.The proposed Richmond school safety resolution voices opposition to arming teachers for self-defense, even as it calls for more gun control outside of schools. The resolution says, “The School Board and [Richmond Public Schools] is opposed to the arming of teachers to protect schools and children.”Moreover, the proposed resolution calls for extending gun-free school zones. It should be noted that Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was not only a gun-free zone but an ammunition-free zone as well, yet none of these designations mattered to the gunman who was intent on taking lives of defenseless individuals.The proposed resolution also calls on Congress to fund “programs to educate students and their families on the dangers of firearms.”Richmond Times-Dispatch reporter Justin Mattingly reports the school board is expected to take up the school safety resolution at its next meeting.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Would they leave their children in the United States or take them to a country they have never known? Stay together or separate, with the hope the children will have more opportunity if they stay here? [Emphasis added]…The 30-year-old woman and 37-year-old man, who live in Western Massachusetts, have four children together, three of whom were born in the United States. Neither parent is in the country legally. [Emphasis added]…The mother recently gave birth to her fifth child, whose father is also undocumented. [Emphasis added]There are an estimated 4.5 million United States-born children who were given birthright citizenship despite at least one of their parents being an illegal alien, as Breitbart News has reported.These children are commonly known as “anchor babies,” as they are able to eventually bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. through the process known as “chain migration.”The 4.5 million anchor babies estimate exceeds the four million American children born every year. https://t.co/o6qXvyP57H— John Binder 👽 (@JxhnBinder) December 29, 2017The Boston Globe report not only sheds light on the extent to which illegal aliens cross into the U.S. to have anchor babies but also on the low-wage lifestyle in which most illegal aliens in the country live.For example, the report highlights that both illegal aliens work as restaurant cooks for 40 hours a week, making only minimum wage at $11 an hour.For employers, the 12 to 30 million illegal alien population has meant a never-ending flow of cheap labor by illegal aliens who are often paid off-the-books and with below-market wages, keeping American wages stagnant for decades.As Breitbart News reported, the U.S. is nearly alone in granting citizenship to illegal aliens’ children. For example, the U.S. and Canada are the only developed nations with birthright citizenship. On the other hand, countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Italy, and Germany have either outlawed birthright citizenship or never had such a policy to begin with.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Thad Cochran, urged Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant during the weekend edition of Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM to prevent a Republican “bloodbath” and refrain from appointing a Mitch McConnell-approved candidate to the seat.“We have a clear path to victory in a red, red state, but for intra-party feud or combat that they’re, I suppose, willing to bring to the table because of Mitch McConnell,” McDaniel told hosts Matthew Boyle and Amanda House. He expressed hope that Bryant would not appoint a replacement to Cochran before voters have a chance to make their own choice.Boyle said he believes the best result would be if Republicans united behind McDaniel.McDaniel reminded listeners that in 2014, Trump endorsed McDaniel over Cochran:I hope voters in Mississippi cast their ballot for @senatormcdaniel. He is strong, he is smart & he wants things to change in Washington.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2014Boyle asked why McDaniel would be better than a McConnell-appointed candidate.“Generally speaking, we have to find fighters to stand up and I’m a fighter. My record shows that,” McDaniel told the listening audience. “I don’t mind standing against McConnell. I don’t mind standing against the establishment in order to effectuate conservative reform.”McDaniel called for removing the 60-vote threshold on Senate confirmations, repealing Obamacare, funding for the southern border wall, defunding Planned Parenthood, and defunding sanctuary cities.Boyle asked McDaniel why the Washington, DC, swamp is afraid of him.“Because when I campaigned as a Republican and I took a stand to fight for our platform, I really meant it,” said McDaniel, who then gave the example, “When I talk about lowering taxes, I’m gonna try and lower taxes.”“I’m not going to be a yes man to Mitch McConnell,” he continued.McDaniel criticized Congress for finding money to fund Planned Parenthood, but not a border wall. He added that they must fight against amnesty and not compromise on DACA.On the record of Trump’s presidency thus far, McDaniel said he was doing a “remarkable” job. “When we see or sense the momentum shift our direction, that is not the time to delay. That’s the time to attack and that’s something that he’s done effectively. And it starts with just being an agent of change.”He then recounted his past work with Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, as well as the governor’s recent trip to Washington, DC, for the State of the Union. According to McDaniel, he met with McConnell while there and has since made clear that McDaniel will not be appointed to Cochran’s seat, a move that McDaniel said he is confident came from McConnell.McDaniel warned that it looks like Bryant may appoint someone else, causing a potential Republican bloodbath that would benefit a Democrat in his race. He added that he still hopes the governor will “make the right decision,” suggesting that Bryant not make an appointment other than himself.Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

However, in an interview, Trump said the Russia investigation was also on his mind.Comey told lawmakers that Trump had asked him to let former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn go — who was under FBI investigation — during a private conversation. The president has denied making any such request.Comey later admitted he took notes after conversations with the president, and he gave them to at least one friend to pass to the media after he was no longer FBI director, for the purpose of prompting the appointment of a special counsel.Mueller’s team has been negotiating with White House lawyers to work out the specifics of an interview with Trump within “the next few weeks,” according to Axios.The “big question” is whether it will be in person, in writing, or a combination of the two.Kenneth Starr, the special counsel whose investigation led to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, told Fox News recently that he did not see any evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump.“I’ve seen nothing in … the firing of [former FBI Director] James Comey and all of the aftermath that suggest the president has obstructed justice,” he told Fox News on February 28.The president tweeted repeatedly over the weekend about the special counsel investigation, reflecting his deep frustration over the matter.If Axios’s report is true, it would mean the president was aware during his tweeting that Mueller’s interest is on obstruction of justice, rather than any alleged collusion.The president attacked Comey — who is set to launch a book tour next month.“Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI — A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!” he tweeted on Saturday.Trump also reiterated that there was “no collusion.”“As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State. #DrainTheSwamp.”He continued tweeting about the probe into Sunday: “The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improerly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!”On Monday, the president continued: “A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!”Despite his tweets, White House lawyer Ty Cobb said the president had no intention of firing Mueller.“In response to media speculation and related questions being posed to the Administration, the White House yet again confirms that the President is not considering or discussing the firing of the Special Counsel, Robert Mueller,” he said in a statement.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

He broadcasted to his network that he was “refused service” at a local business and now the rumblings are spreading. The post also featured a crossed-out Oakland police seal and badge in pink with the Spanish words “Habla con tu vecinxs no con la policia,” which translates to, “Speak with your neighbors, not the police.”The coffee shop also supports convicted cop-killer Assata Shakur (JoAnne Chesimard), who escaped from a New Jersey prison and fled to Cuba after being convicted of the murder of police officer Werner Foerster in 1973. The Women’s March supports Shakur, and the felon has even received support from Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), who is being challenged by conservative Latino Omar Navarro (R) in California’s 43rd congressional district..“After five minutes of standing outside the coffee shop, a man comes out and threatens to call the cops,” Whitty wrote in the email to Breitbart News.She continued:Basically he threatened to call the cops because we were peacefully protesting a coffee shop that hates cops. This coffee shop also has a picture of Assata Shakur, the famous cop killer, who escaped prison and fled for Cuba where she was protected by Fidel Castro.

He called on Congress to end funding for sanctuary cities.“If we are not going to get tough on the drug dealers who kill thousands of people and destroy so many people’s lives, we are just doing the wrong thing,” he said. “We have got to get tough.”Trump specifically vowed to empower law enforcement to crack down on the supply of drugs, including prescription drug reforms targeting doctors and drug companies.“I love tough guys, we need tough guys,” Trump said, pointing out an ICE agent in the audience.The audience in New Hampshire cheered Trump’s proposed solutions, many of them wearing red Make America Great Again campaign hats in support of the president.The president also announced a plan to create more advertisements to “scare” young people away from opioid addiction, much like cigarette advertisements.“The best way to beat the drug crisis is to keep people from getting hooked on drugs to begin with,” he said.He promised that the Department of Justice was considering a federal lawsuit against some of the drug companies who manufacture opioids.

Jan Brewer had announced that the Grand Canyon State would not issue licenses to DACA recipients, rejecting the idea that the federal government’s executive branch could grant such amnesty without Congress first passing legislation to that effect, citing a state’s sovereignty under the Tenth Amendment to make its own decisions regarding driving privileges. The Arizona Dream Act Coalition (ADAC) filed suit.Republican-led states – with a couple Democrats thrown in to make it somewhat bipartisan – launched several challenges to President Barack Obama’s amnesty programs for illegal aliens. The first such amnesty was DACA, which Obama created in 2012.Obama then expanded DACA with the Deferred Action for the Parents of Americans (DAPA), which a federal appeals court struck down in 2015, and which President Trump’s administration ended after Attorney General Jeff Sessions declared DAPA illegal. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced that its cancellation was pursuant to Sessions’ legal opinion.Despite various political and legal disputes, DACA is still lingering on the books, at least for the moment. That kept alive ADAC’s lawsuit against the state regarding driver’s licenses.The Constitution’s Tenth Amendment affirms that America’s 50 sovereign states have police power, which is the authority to make laws for public safety, public health, personal responsibility, and the general welfare of society. Arizona asserted that authority here, while ADAC argued that federal law preempts all state-level legal and policy determinations regarding immigration, and thus, Arizona must accept the legal status of anyone the federal government says is permitted to stay in this country.A federal judge ruled against Arizona. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed that judgment, saying that it assumed that DACA was the equivalent of a federal law passed by Congress, and thus, DACA supersedes any state actions to the contrary. Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich – regarded by many as a conservative champion – petitioned the Supreme Court to take the case.The Supreme Court denied the request, called a petition for a writ of certiorari. Four justices are required to “grant cert,” meaning that as many as three of the nine justices could have voted in favor of taking the case.The case is Brewer v. Arizona Dream Act Coalition, No. 16-1180, at the U.S. Supreme Court.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/19/5-major-problems-regarding-john-kerrys-state-department-and-the-trump-hoax-dossier/","NEW YORK — Numerous officials from John Kerry’s State Department have been fingered for playing roles in the distribution – and in one case, possibly also the compilation – of the largely discredited, 35-page anti-Trump dossier.President Trump has been facing news media scrutiny for tweeting on Sunday about “leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels” of federal agencies, including the State Department.As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State. #DrainTheSwamp— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2018While Trump did not provide specifics, two top officials at Kerry’s State Department have already admitted to involvement in the dossier affair, and a third has been named.Dossier author Christopher Steele was commissioned to produce the questionable document by the controversial Fusion GPS opposition research firm, which was paid for its anti-Trump work by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee.The Steele dossier was reportedly utilized by the FBI in part to conduct its probe into Trump over unsubstantiated claims of collusion with Russia. According to House Intelligence Committee documents, the questionable dossier was also used by Obama administration officials to obtain a FISA warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, who briefly served as a volunteer foreign policy adviser to Trump’s campaign. The political origins of the dossier and issues relating to Steele’s credibility as a source were kept from the FISA court, a House Republican memo documents.Below are five major problems regarding the dossier and the roles allegedly played by Kerry State Department officials.1 – State Department official Jonathan Winer exchanged documents and information with dossier author Christopher Steele, and passed the dossier contents to other officials at the State Department.  Winer admitted to receiving information from Clinton associate Sidney Blumenthal that originated with Cody Shearer, a shadowy former tabloid journalist who has long been closely associated with various Clinton scandals.  Winer conceded that he passed Shearer’s anti-Trump material to Steele.After his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with dossier author and former British spy Christopher Steele.Winer further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an “old friend.” Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal – which Winer in turn gave to Steele – originated with Cody Shearer.Winer served under Bill Clinton’s administration as the U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for international law enforcement. He wrote in his recent Washington Post oped that he rejoined the State Department in 2013 at the insistence of John Kerry.In the Post piece, Winer related that while he was at the State Department, he repeatedly passed documents from Steele related to Russia to State officials, including to Victoria Nuland, a career diplomat who worked under the Clintons and served as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under Kerry.“Over the next two years, I shared more than 100 of Steele’s reports with the Russia experts at the State Department, who continued to find them useful,” he wrote.Winer wrote that in the summer of 2016, Steele “told me that he had learned of disturbing information regarding possible ties between Donald Trump, his campaign and senior Russian officials.”Winer says that he met with Steele in September 2016 to discuss details that would later become known as the anti-Trump dossier. Winer wrote that he prepared a two-page summary of Steele’s information and “shared it with Nuland, who indicated that, like me, she felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material.”Besides bringing Steele’s dossier information to the State Department, Winer conceded that he also passed information from Blumenthal to Steele, specifically charges about Trump that originated with Shearer.Winer described what he claimed was the evolution of his contacts with Blumenthal regarding Shearer’s information, which he says he passed to Steele:In late September, I spoke with an old friend, Sidney Blumenthal, whom I met 30 years ago when I was investigating the Iran-Contra affair for then-Sen. Kerry and Blumenthal was a reporter at the Post. At the time, Russian hacking was at the front and center in the 2016 presidential campaign. The emails of Blumenthal, who had a long association with Bill and Hillary Clinton, had been hacked in 2013 through a Russian server.While talking about that hacking, Blumenthal and I discussed Steele’s reports. He showed me notes gathered by a journalist I did not know, Cody Shearer, that alleged the Russians had compromising information on Trump of a sexual and financial nature.What struck me was how some of the material echoed Steele’s but appeared to involve different sources. On my own, I shared a copy of these notes with Steele, to ask for his professional reaction. He told me it was potentially “collateral” information. I asked him what that meant. He said that it was similar but separate from the information he had gathered from his sources. I agreed to let him keep a copy of the Shearer notes.Shearer has numerous close personal and family connections to the Clintons and has reportedly been involved in numerous antics tied to them. National Review previously dubbed Shearer a “Creepy Clinton Confidante” and “The Strangest Character in Hillary’s Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy.”In his Washington Post oped, Winer does not say whether he knew at the time he interfaced with Steele that the ex-British spy was working for Fusion GPS, or that Fusion was being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign via the Perkins Coie law firm.2 – Victoria Nuland, a senior official in Kerry’s State Department, gave the green light for the FBI to first meet with Steele regarding his wild claims about Trump and Russia, according to a book released last week. It was at that meeting that Steele initially reported his dossier charges to the FBI, the book relates.The book, Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, is authored by reporters by Michael Isikoff and David Corn.The new book documents Steele told Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson that he believed the claims that he uncovered about Trump represented a “grave national security threat” that needed to be reported to the FBI. Simpson eventually allowed Steele to report the dossier’s claims to the FBI, the book reports.Steele sought out Rome-based FBI Special Agent Michael Gaeta, with whom he had worked on a previous case. Before Gaeta met with Steele on July 5, 2016, the book relates that the FBI first secured the support of Nuland.Regarding the arrangements for Steele’s initial meeting with the FBI about the dossier claims, Isikoff and Corn report:There were a few hoops Gaeta had to jump through. He was assigned to the U.S. embassy in Rome. The FBI checked with Victoria Nuland’s office at the State Department : Do you support this meeting ? Nuland, having found Steele’s reports on Ukraine to have been generally credible, gave the green light.Within a few days, on July 5, Gaeta arrived and headed to Steele’s office near Victoria station . Steele handed him a copy of the report. Gaeta, a seasoned FBI agent, started to read . He turned white. For a while, Gaeta said nothing . Then he remarked, “I have to report this to headquarters.”The book documents that Nuland previously received Steele’s reports on the Ukrainian crisis and had been familiar with Steele’s general work.Nuland did not return a Breitbart News request for comment. She previously served as chief of staff to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott under Bill Clinton’s administration, and then served as deputy director for former Soviet Union affairs.Nuland faced confirmation questions prior to her most recent appointment as assistant secretary of state over her reported role in revising controversial Obama administration talking points about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks. Her reported changes sought to protect Hillary Clinton’s State Department from accusations that it failed to adequately secure the woefully unprotected U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi.3 – Kerry’s former chief of staff reportedly circulated a dossier summary while at the State Department.An extensive New Yorker profile of Steele from earlier this month named Kerry’s chief of staff at the State Department, John Finer, as obtaining the contents of a two-page summary of the dossier and eventually deciding to share the questionable document with Kerry.Finer received the dossier summary from Winer.New Yorker staff writer Jane Mayer named Finer in her report:In September, 2016, Steele briefed Winer on the dossier at a Washington hotel. Winer prepared a two-page summary and shared it with a few senior State Department officials. Among them were Nuland and Jon Finer, the director of policy planning and the chief of staff to Secretary of State John Kerry. For several days, Finer weighed whether or not to burden Kerry with the information. He’d found the summary highly disturbing, but he didn’t know how to assess its claims. Eventually, he decided that, since others knew, his boss should know, too.When Kerry was briefed, though, he didn’t think there was any action that he could take. He asked if FBI agents knew about the dossier, and, after being assured that they did, that was apparently the end of it. Finer agreed with Kerry’s assessment, and put the summary in his safe, and never took it out again. Nuland’s reaction was much the same. She told Winer to tell Steele to take his dossier to the FBI. The so-called Deep State, it seems, hardly jumped into action against Trump.In February, the Daily Beast cited “a person familiar with that conversation” as saying that Finer was questioned as part of the Senate intelligence committee’s investigation.The report did not mention Finer’s alleged involvement with the dossier affair.4 – Kerry State Department official Winer says that fellow State Department official Nuland recommended that the dossier be taken to Kerry.As also cited above, Winer wrote in his Washington Post piece about obtaining the dossier information from Steele:I was allowed to review, but not to keep, a copy of these reports to enable me to alert the State Department. I prepared a two-page summary and shared it with Nuland, who indicated that, like me, she felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material.5 –  Winer and Nuland give seemingly conflicting accounts of Nuland’s handling of the Trump hoax dossier.Nuland described in a recent Politico podcast interview what she claimed was her reaction when she was presented with Steele’s dossier information at the State Department.She said that she offered advice to “those who were interfacing with” Steele, immediately telling the intermediary or intermediaries that Steele “should get this information to the FBI.” She further explained that a career employee at the State Department could not get involved with the dossier charges since such actions could violate the Hatch Act, which prevents employees in the executive branch of the federal government from engaging in certain kinds of political activities.In a second interview, this one with CBS’s Face The Nation, Nuland also stated that her “immediate” reaction was to refer Steele to the FBI.Here is a transcript of the relevant section of her February 5 interview with Susan B. Glasser, who described Nuland as “my friend” and referred to her by her nickname “Toria”:Glasser: When did you first hear about his dossier?Nuland: I first heard — and I didn’t know who his client was until much later, until 2017, I think, when it came out. I first heard that he had done work for a client asserting these linkages — I think it was late July, something like that.Glasser: That’s very interesting. And you would have taken him seriously just because you knew that he knew what he was talking about on Russia?Nuland: What I did was say that this is about U.S. politics, and not the work of — not the business of the State Department, and certainly not the business of a career employee who is subject to the Hatch Act, which requires that you stay out of politics. So, my advice to those who were interfacing with him was that he should get this information to the FBI, and that they could evaluate whether they thought it was credible.Glasser: Did you ever talk about it with anyone else higher up at the department? With Secretary Kerry or anybody else?Nuland: Secretary Kerry was also aware. I think he’s on the record and he had the same advice.Nuland stated that Kerry “was also aware” of the dossier, but she did not describe how he was made aware. She made clear that she told “those who were interfacing” with Steele to go to the FBI since any State Department involvement could violate the Hatch Act.Her Politico podcast interview was not the only time she claimed that her reaction was to refer Steele to the FBI.On Face The Nation on February 4, Nuland engaged in the following exchange in which she stated her “immediate” reaction was to refer Steele to the FBI (emphasis added):MARGARET BRENNAN: The dossier.VICTORIA NULAND: The dossier, he passed two to four pages of short points of what he was finding, and our immediate reaction to that was, “This is not in our purview. This needs to go to the FBI, if there is any concern here that one candidate or the election as a whole might be influenced by the Russian federation. That’s something for the FBI to investigate.”And that was our reaction when we saw this. It’s not our — we can’t evaluate this. And frankly, if every member of the campaign who the Russians tried to approach and tried to influence had gone to the FBI as well in real time, we might not be in the mess we’re in today.Nuland gave the two interviews after her name started surfacing in news media reports involving Kerry’s State Department and the dossier. Her name also came up in relation to a criminal referral of Steele to the Justice Department in the form of a recent letter authored by Sen. Chuck Grassley, Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Lindsey Graham (R-SC).It is Winer’s version of events that seems to conflict with Nuland’s.In his Washington Post oped, Winer writes that Nuland’s reaction was that “she felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material.” He does not relate any further reaction from Nuland.Nuland’s public claim that her “immediate” response was to refer Steele to the FBI since State involvement could violate the Hatch Act seems to conflict with the only reaction that Winer relates from Nuland – that she felt Kerry should be made aware of the dossier information.Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/19/trump-admin-blasts-california-illegal-alien-office/","The Trump administration is criticizing the State of California over a decision to appoint an illegal alien, Lizbeth Mateo, to a statewide office.Mateo was appointed last week to the Student Opportunity and Access Program Project Grant Advisory Committee by the State Senate Rules Committee.A Trump administration official told Breitbart News on Monday: “California continues to break new ground in an effort to thumb their nose at the rule of law.“Their message to the world is clear: California’s ‘leadership’ is willing to protect anyone — including criminals — in an effort to score political points. Intentionally undermining public safety in this manner is not an equation that bodes well for Californians.”Mateo was brought to the U.S. from Mexico at the age of 14 by her parents, who are also illegal aliens.Unlike other so-called “Dreamers,” Mateo is not eligible for the Obama administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. In 2013, she returned to Mexico and visited family in Oaxaca before attempting to cross the border illegally back into the U.S. as part of a protest. She was arrested and detained at the border before being released after she petitioned for asylum.State Senate President pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) celebrated her appointment by calling Mateo “a courageous, determined and intelligent young woman who at great personal risk has dedicated herself to fight for those seeking their rightful place in this country.”Thank you Sen. @kdeleon for appointing me to the CalSOAP Advisory Committee.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/politics/trump-chaos-trade-russia-national-security.html","PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump decamped to his oceanfront estate here on Friday after a head-spinning series of presidential decisions on national security, trade and the budget that left the capital reeling and his advisers nervous about what comes next.The decisions attested to a president riled up by cable news and unbound. Mr. Trump appeared heedless of his staff, unconcerned about Washington decorum, or the latest stock market dive, and confident of his instincts. He seemed determined to set the agenda himself, even if that agenda looked like a White House in disarray.Inside the West Wing, aides described an atmosphere of bewildered resignation as they grappled with the all-too-familiar task of predicting and reacting in real time to Mr. Trump’s shifting moods.Aides said there was no grand strategy to the president’s actions, and that he got up each morning this week not knowing what he would do. Much as he did as a New York businessman at Trump Tower, Mr. Trump watched television, reacted to what he saw on television and then reacted to the reaction.Aides said he was still testing his limits as president while also feeling embattled by incoming fire — from Congress, the Russia investigation, foreign entanglements, a potential trade war and a pornographic film actress and a Playboy model who said they had affairs with Mr. Trump and were paid to keep quiet.The president, furious over the failure of Congress to pay for his wall on the southern border with Mexico, began Friday by threatening in a Twitter post shortly before 9 a.m. to veto a $1.3 trillion spending bill passed hours earlier by Congress. That raised the specter of another government shutdown at midnight, this one precipitated entirely by Mr. Trump.By 1:30 p.m., Mr. Trump had begrudgingly signed the bill and, in a hastily arranged appearance in the Diplomatic Reception Room, called it a “ridiculous situation.”In the frantic hours before the signing, two senior officials said they were uncertain whether the president would veto the measure and prompt a shutdown or ultimately relent. White House officials raced to schedule an afternoon briefing for the news media, although they had no idea what they would end up telling reporters.John F. Kelly, the chief of staff, in the meantime swung into action to pull the president back from the brink of a veto. Mr. Kelly summoned Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to the White House, aides said, to make the case for the military funding included in the bill.In the Oval Office, Mr. Mattis; the homeland security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen; and Vice President Mike Pence — who had postponed a trip to Atlanta because of the president’s veto threat — told Mr. Trump that the military spending level in the bill was historic and urged him to sign. Mr. Trump finally agreed. He then tweeted that he would hold a “news conference” on the subject himself.What followed was a bizarre spectacle that was part-signing ceremony and part venting session as Mr. Trump presented his audiences with his dilemma in real time. He raged against the bill’s contents and the process that yielded it.“Nobody more disappointed than me,” Mr. Trump said in a verdict from a president who has called himself a master dealmaker.The whipsaw on spending came hours after the president forced out his national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, and replaced him with John R. Bolton, a hard-line former American ambassador to the United Nations, catalyzing fears of a sharp turn toward military confrontation on Mr. Trump’s national security team.Mr. Mattis, viewed as a moderating force on the president, told colleagues before the appointment was announced that he would find it difficult to work with Mr. Bolton, people briefed on the conversation said.Mr. Bolton’s appointment followed Mr. Trump’s announcement of tariffs on $60 billion worth of Chinese imports, which sank financial markets on Thursday and ignited fears of a trans-Pacific trade war. New steel and aluminum tariffs also took effect on Friday, though the White House exempted several allies from the measures, sowing equal measures of relief and confusion.The tumult occurred against the ominous backdrop of the Russia investigation. The resignation of Mr. Trump’s lead lawyer, John Dowd, on Thursday signaled that the president was determined to sit down with investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, even as he takes a more combative stance toward the overall investigation.Shortly before the president went on television on Friday to fume about the spending bill, several of his top advisers — including Mr. Mattis; the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross; Ms. Nielsen; and Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner — could be seen huddling in the Palm Court of the White House. They were deep in what appeared to be serious conversation.Also on Friday, the departing national security adviser, General McMaster, bid farewell to the staff of the National Security Council. Staff members gave him a three-minute standing ovation, and there was talk of an exodus of career officials. Some were stunned by the sudden change in leadership, even though General McMaster’s status with Mr. Trump was known to have been shaky for weeks.General McMaster was later spotted walking briskly out of the White House complex.As Mr. Bolton prepares to replace General McMaster, people briefed by the White House said, the president has told Mr. Bolton that he needs to cut down on leaks, like the disclosure this week that Mr. Trump disregarded his briefing materials in a call with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.That has prompted a debate over whether Mr. Bolton should carry out a housecleaning of the security council or leave the existing staff in place.Democrats and others said Mr. Bolton’s record of advocating military action against Iran and North Korea raised the risk of war.“Mr. Bolton’s tendency to try to solve every geopolitical problem w/ the American military first is a troubling one,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in a tweet on Thursday. “I hope he will temper his instinct to commit our armed forces to conflicts around the globe, when we need to be focused on building the middle class here at home.”Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association, said in a statement, “Bolton’s extreme views could tilt the malleable Mr. Trump in the wrong direction on critical decisions affecting the future of the Iran nuclear deal, the North Korean nuclear crisis, and the strained U.S. relationship with Russia, among other issues.”Rumors swirled at the White House that the president’s purge might soon continue with the firing of David Shulkin, the embattled secretary of the Veterans Affairs Department.Mr. Trump is methodically shedding himself of those who have clashed with his views, including Rex W. Tillerson, his secretary of state, who was fired last week. But the president is also losing aides like Hope Hicks, his communications director and confidante, whose resignation is effective soon.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/trump-transgender-military.html","WASHINGTON — Transgender troops who are currently in the United States military may remain in the ranks, the White House said late Friday, but the Pentagon could require them to serve according to their gender at birth.The policy recommendation that President Trump approved flatly states that “transgender persons who require or have undergone gender transition are disqualified from military service.” But it also largely gives the Pentagon the ability to make exceptions where it sees fit.The policy adopts recommendations that Mr. Trump received last month from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. It comes after court rulings froze the president’s initial ban on transgender troops — issued in July — as potentially unconstitutional.“In my professional judgment, these policies will place the Department of Defense in the strongest position to protect the American people, to fight and win America’s wars, and to ensure the survival and success of our service members around the world,” Mr. Mattis wrote in a summary of his recommendations to the president.The policy announcement outraged advocates for transgender troops, and the advocates vowed to fight the limits in court.“There is no evidence to support a policy that bars from military service patriotic Americans who are medically fit and able to deploy,” said Aaron Belkin, the director of the Palm Center, which focuses on sexuality and the military. “Our troops and our nation deserve better.”In a series of Twitter posts in July, Mr. Trump announced that “the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military.”He said he decided to issue the ban after consulting with generals and military experts, although Mr. Mattis was given only a day’s notice. In August, Mr. Trump directed the Pentagon to reverse an Obama administration policy that had allowed transgender people — or those diagnosed with gender dysphoria, or had discomfort with their biological gender — to serve in the military.In October, a judge in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia temporarily blocked Mr. Trump’s ban and said the reasoning behind it was most likely unconstitutional because it represented a “disapproval of transgender people generally.” Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly had ruled that the military’s current policy should remain in place.Mr. Trump’s new order allows the defense secretary and the homeland security secretary to “exercise their authority to implement any appropriate policies concerning military service by transgender individuals.”In a memo to the president, dated Feb. 22, Mr. Mattis cited “substantial risks” about military personnel who seek to change or who question their gender identity.He said that allowing some of them to serve would amount to an exemption of certain mental, physical and sex-based standards, and “could undermine readiness, disrupt unit cohesion, and impose an unreasonable burden on the military that is not conducive to military effectiveness and lethality.”Mr. Mattis’s assertion contradicts a 2016 study by the RAND Corporation, which found that allowing transgender people to serve in the military would “have minimal impact on readiness and health care costs” for the Pentagon.The study estimated that health care costs would rise $2.4 million to $8.4 million a year, representing an infinitesimal 0.04 to 0.13 percent increase in spending. It concluded that there were 2,000 to 11,000 active-duty troops who are transgender.Citing research into other countries that allow transgender people to serve, the study projected “little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness or readiness” in the United States.Mr. Mattis, in his recommendation to Mr. Trump, complained that the RAND study “heavily caveated data to support its conclusions, glossed over the impacts of health care costs, readiness, and unit cohesion, and erroneously relied on the selective experiences of foreign militaries with different operational requirements than our own.”“In short,” Mr. Mattis concluded, “this policy issue has proven more complex than the prior administration or Rand assumed.”In her ruling last October, Judge Kollar-Kotelly rejected the Trump administration’s argument that it needs more time to prepare to process transgender recruits for military service. “The court is not persuaded that defendants will be irreparably injured by allowing the accession of transgender individuals into the military beginning on Jan. 1, 2018,” she wrote.On Friday, Pentagon officials said they would continue to comply with federal law. A Defense Department spokesman said the Pentagon would “continue to assess and retain transgender service members.” The new policy must first be published in the Federal Register, which generally requires new rules to be reviewed and subject to a public comment period before they are enacted.Mr. Trump announced the ban in July to resolve a quietly brewing fight on Capitol Hill over whether taxpayer money should pay for gender transition and hormone therapy for transgender service members.But rather than addressing that narrow issue, Mr. Trump opted to upend the entire policy on transgender service members. His decision was announced with such haste that the White House could not answer basic questions about how it would be carried out, including what would happen to transgender people on active duty.Now, eight months later, what will happen to transgender people on active duty is still unclear.“What the White House has released tonight is transphobia masquerading as policy,” Joshua Block, a senior staff lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union L.G.B.T. and H.I.V. Project, said in a statement.The new policy, according to the A.C.L.U. memo, “effectively coerces transgender people who wish to serve into choosing between their humanity and their country, and makes it clear that transgender service members are not welcome.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/politics/trump-veto-spending-bill.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump, hours after threatening to veto a $1.3 trillion spending bill and throwing the capital into turmoil, signed it into law on Friday, yielding to advisers and Republican leaders who urged him against manufacturing a government shutdown crisis.Even as he signed the bill, the president seethed about being forced to swallow legislation that broadly repudiated an agenda that once foresaw the reshaping of the federal government into his “America First” image.Enactment of the bipartisan spending package, which had seemed like a certainty at dawn, brought an end to hours of chaos at the White House, where Mr. Trump surprised his advisers — and Republican congressional leaders — with an angry morning tweet threatening to sink a measure that his aides had already promised he would sign.His stated reason was its lack of funding for his promised border wall, but that was only one disappointment for the president in a measure that blocked the hiring of thousands of new border patrol agents; stopped deep cuts to foreign aid, the diplomatic corps and environmental programs; thwarted a push to fund vouchers for private and parochial schools; and even rescued the National Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities.“There are a lot of things that I’m unhappy about in this bill,” Mr. Trump said during a hastily called event at the White House, where the president placed his hand on a foot-high copy of the 2,232-page bill he said he had just signed. “There are a lot of things that we shouldn’t have had in this bill. But we were, in a sense, forced — if we want to build our military — we were forced to have. There are some things that we should have in the bill.”In a rambling and disjointed statement from the Diplomatic Reception Room, Mr. Trump called the process that yielded the legislation “this ridiculous situation,” and he warned, “I will never sign another bill like this again — I’m not going to do it again.”The dramatic denouement for the spending bill, which drew fury from Mr. Trump’s core supporters, left both political parties in Washington reeling and some of his own aides bewildered about the president’s contradictory actions. Yet it was only the latest instance of Mr. Trump chafing against the advice of his advisers and throwing his own brand of chaos into the gears of the federal government.Mr. Trump’s grudging embrace only highlighted the degree to which a president who portrays himself as the ultimate dealmaker has been sidelined by congressional leaders in both parties when it comes to striking compromises to fund the core functions of government. Instead, Mr. Trump has proved unable to find a way to negotiate victories on some of his highest priorities.Ardent conservatives who are Mr. Trump’s core backers were left wondering aloud whether the president’s capitulation and failures would imperil Republicans’ chances of keeping control of Congress in the midterm elections this fall. Amy Kremer, a Tea Party activist who helped founded Women for Trump, tweeted, “I’m done.”“Democrats just won November #midterms. No point in wasting my time between now and then,” Ms. Kremer wrote.Mr. Trump said the spending plan was important because it includes hundreds of billions of dollars in military spending to ensure that the United States has “by far the strongest military in the world.”“We had no choice but to fund our military,” Mr. Trump declared, reading aloud a series of military programs and weapons systems in the spending bill, including submarines, missile defense systems, tanks, helicopters and warships.But in a bizarre version of the usually upbeat bill-signing ceremonies at the White House, Mr. Trump then went on to denigrate the legislation as “crazy.”“Nobody read it,” Mr. Trump said of the gargantuan funding measure drawn up by Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate. Echoing criticism from those who voted against it, Mr. Trump added, “It’s only hours old.”He urged lawmakers to avoid passage of another so-called omnibus bill and to instead pass legislation giving him a line-item veto of spending measures, something that the Supreme Court has already ruled to be unconstitutional. He also called on the Senate to eliminate filibusters.“I looked very seriously at the veto,” Mr. Trump told reporters. “I was thinking about doing the veto.”If he had, it would almost certainly have shut down the government at midnight, just as hundreds of thousands of teenagers and adults were scheduled to descend on Washington for a gun control march on Saturday. With Congress on spring recess for two weeks starting Monday, many lawmakers had already departed Washington and some were on their way out of the country as part of official congressional delegations.The spending measure cleared Congress early Friday morning and, while Mr. Trump had made plain he was unhappy with some aspects of it, his senior advisers spent Thursday telling reporters that he would sign it. Then early Friday, on a morning when he watched a fierce backlash to the measure play out on Fox News, Mr. Trump seemed to hesitate, tweeting angrily about the lack of wall funding.“I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded,” Mr. Trump wrote.He was referring partly to the fact that he failed to reach a deal with Democrats to include provisions in the spending measure that would preserve Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program that Mr. Trump rescinded last fall. The program allows undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children to apply for permits to work legally and avoid deportation.But the president was most angry about the lack of funding in the bill for an enormous wall across the nation’s southern border that he has billed as the centerpiece of his crackdown on illegal immigration. The measure includes nearly $1.6 billion for border security, including new technology and repairs to existing barriers — but not Mr. Trump’s wall, as he claimed on Twitter on Wednesday.It provides $641 million for about 33 miles of new fencing, but prohibits building a concrete structure or other prototypes the president has considered.Mr. Trump’s morning tweet set off a scramble on Capitol Hill and at the White House. Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, phoned Mr. Trump and encouraged him to sign the measure, according to a source familiar with the call, citing all the “wins” contained in the bill, especially for the military.The president’s top advisers rushed to bring in Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense, to make the case to Mr. Trump that he must sign the legislation because of its robust military funding. Within hours, Mr. Mattis was in the Oval Office with Mr. Trump telling him the level of military spending was “historic,” according to a senior White House official. Vice President Mike Pence, who had postponed a trip to deal with the crisis, also chimed in to make a case for signing the bill.The president relented. In his remarks not long after, Mr. Trump expressed disappointment and said he was “not happy” that the bill did not allocate the full $25 billion that the administration had requested for the wall. But he sought to claim some measure of victory, saying that $1.6 billion “does start the wall” and promising to “make that $1.6 billion go very, very far.”The political whiplash that he had put Washington through was reflected in Mr. Trump’s own comments. At times, he seemed to direct blame for the spending bill on Republican lawmakers. But later, he praised them for doing their best in a tough situation.“I just want to thank members of Congress for working so hard,” he said. “There are a lot of strings pulling everyone in different directions.”The president’s threat came as a surprise but hardly a shock to Republican leaders, who spent much of a snowy Wednesday privately imploring an agitated Mr. Trump to put aside his objections and back the measure, claiming it as a win.Sensing a political advantage, Democrats were unperturbed by Mr. Trump’s veto threat fire drill. Top Democratic aides said on Friday morning that they would not make concessions to Mr. Trump if he chose to reject the legislation, but lawmakers stayed silent until the president signed the bill. Then they cheered the measure as a disavowal of Mr. Trump’s ideas.“In sharp contrast to the devastating cuts called for in the Trump budget, the omnibus contains robust funding to combat homelessness, create new affordable housing and promote community development,” Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the minority leader, said in a statement. She added, “The omnibus also rejects the Trump administration’s cruel anti-immigrant agenda.”Mr. Trump said on Friday afternoon that it was Democrats who had balked at including an extension of DACA in the spending bill, claiming that Republicans wanted to protect immigrants from deportation but were blocked by Democrats.In fact, over the weekend, the White House offered to extend protections for hundreds of thousands of current DACA recipients for two and a half years, with no guarantee beyond that time, in exchange for $25 billion for the border wall, according to congressional aides.Democrats countered by saying they would agree to the full $25 billion only if the president agreed to a pathway to citizenship for a much broader population of young immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, well over a million people — a deal that was similar to an earlier offer from Mr. Trump.The White House rejected the Democratic offer.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/trump-national-security-bolton.html","WASHINGTON — The incoming national security adviser has called for the “swift takeover” of North Korea by the South. He and the newly nominated secretary of state have urged withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. The pick for C.I.A. director once oversaw harsh interrogations of terrorism suspects that her critics claim was plainly torture.And the two generals celebrated by President Trump for their reputations for toughness are now considered the moderates — and at risk of falling out of his favor.Not since the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, have key national security leaders so publicly raised the threat of military confrontation if foreign adversaries do not meet America’s demands.But George W. Bush’s war cabinet was responding to the biggest direct attack on the United States since Pearl Harbor. The current moment of peril arises from Mr. Trump’s conviction that the United States is being pushed around by adversaries who need to understand that “America First” means they have a brief window to negotiate a deal, or force may follow.Now, the members of Mr. Trump’s newly constituted team are about to face multiple, simultaneous tests of their past proclamations and sometimes conflicting instincts. North Korea and Iran pose the most immediate challenge, with Mr. Trump setting negotiation deadlines that are only months away.Over the longer term, they must straighten out the strategic incoherence surrounding Mr. Trump’s approach to Russia and China, defining the meaning of the administration’s policy declaration earlier this year that “great power competition — not terrorism — is now the primary focus of U.S. national security.”Washington is now consumed by a debate over whether Mr. Trump’s new team plans to govern as far to the right as it talks.So far, the incoming national security adviser, John R. Bolton, has declared that his past comments are “behind me.” Hours after his selection was announced, Mr. Bolton vowed that he would find ways to execute the policies that Mr. Trump was elected on, but that he would not tolerate slow-walking and leaks from bureaucrats he dismissed as “munchkins.”Some who know Mr. Bolton and his operating style predict titanic clashes.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, the retired general who has argued for keeping the Iran deal intact and warned that military confrontation with North Korea would result in “the worst kind of fighting in most people’s lifetimes,” told colleagues on Friday that he did not know if he could work with Mr. Bolton. The White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, another retired four-star general, was also unenthusiastic about Mr. Bolton’s hiring.Mr. Bolton’s harshest critics — mostly Democrats, but their ranks include some members of the Bush administration — argue that the odds of taking military action will rise dramatically when he becomes the last person a volatile American president consults.“John Bolton is not some gray bureaucrat whose views are unknown to us,” said Michael McFaul, the American ambassador to Moscow under President Barack Obama, and now a Stanford professor and the director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.“He’s very clear that there should be regime change in Iran and North Korea, and military force should be used to achieve those goals,” Mr. McFaul said. “If you hire him, you’re making a clear signal that’s what you want.”But others who have worked for years with Mr. Bolton argue that Mr. Trump knows exactly what he is getting: leverage, not conflict.“I think this notion everybody talks about, that the risks of war have gone up, is wrong,” said Stephen J. Hadley, who was Mr. Bush’s national security adviser and a major architect of the invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. “This is the peace-through-strength crowd who want to make clear to people that they’re tough and that no one should cross them. But the reason for that is to deter war.”Dov Zakheim, a former senior Defense Department official who has known Mr. Bolton for 35 years, wrote on Friday that Mr. Bolton “may be a fire breather, but he is a man who cares deeply about his country,” in comparison to his boss, who “cares deeply about Donald Trump.”Whatever Mr. Trump’s motives, his selection of this team would have been hard to imagine when he first came to office declaring that the continued American presence in Iraq was a “disaster,” that he was comfortable with Japan and South Korea getting their own nuclear weapons so the United States would not have to defend them, and that America would no longer be the world’s policeman.Mr. Bolton has come to the opposite conclusion.He not only fervently advocated the attack on Saddam Hussein from his post at the State Department during the Bush administration, but he also defended its aftermath, and has said he remains convinced it was the right decision. Over the past three years, Mr. Bolton has advocated bombing Iran, attacking North Korea, and carving a new state out of Iraq and Syria.Mike Pompeo, the nominee for secretary of state, said at the Aspen Security Conference in July that the most dangerous thing about North Korea was the fact that its young, moody and reportedly ruthless leader, Kim Jong-un, controls its weapons.“So from the administration’s perspective, the most important thing we can do is separate those two. Right?” said Mr. Pompeo, who at the time was months into his current job as C.I.A. director. “Separate capacity and someone who might well have intent, and break those two apart.”Assuming that Mr. Pompeo is confirmed, he and Mr. Bolton, the two most forceful, aggressive new members of the policy team, will have to decide in what order they can risk those confrontations. The Trump administration has said it is open to direct talks with Mr. Kim by May — the same month by which the president has said he will scrap the Iran nuclear accord.“Even if you are going to be a superhawk, you can’t do all these at once,” said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former C.I.A. station chief in Moscow who later hunted down Pakistani nuclear technology as the Energy Department’s chief intelligence officer. “And if you want to go to war with Iran and North Korea, you have to expect to alienate your allies and run headlong into the Russians.”William J. Burns, a longtime American diplomat who was Mr. Bush’s ambassador to Russia and Mr. Obama’s deputy secretary of state, predicted that if the new team exits the Iran deal and confronts North Korea, the first beneficiary is likely to be President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.“He looks for splits,” Mr. Burns said of Mr. Putin. “He knows he will benefit if we walk away from the Iran deal, because it will put a wedge between us and our European allies.”On North Korea, Mr. Burns said, Mr. Putin is seeking “splits between the U.S. and China. We are doing his work for him.”In fact, it is in dealing with Mr. Putin that the new team is likely to run headlong into Mr. Trump’s reluctance to ever say a critical word about the Russian president. As C.I.A. chief, Mr. Pompeo has embraced the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia meddled in the election, though he changes the subject quickly when asked about it.Mr. Bolton, by contrast, has ranked among Mr. Putin’s harshest critics. Last July, days after Mr. Trump met Mr. Putin for the first time at a summit meeting in Germany, Mr. Bolton wrote that the Russian interference in the 2016 election was “a casus belli, a true act of war, and one Washington will never tolerate.”Mr. Trump did not view it that way.He emerged from the meeting in Germany repeating Mr. Putin’s observation that the Russians were too skilled at cyberoperations to be caught if involved. Last week, Mr. Trump called Mr. Putin to congratulate him on winning a Russian election widely viewed as a sham, making no mention of the recent nerve-agent attack that Britain concluded, with American agreement, was a covert action by Moscow.If it was, it was being planned out as Mr. Pompeo was acting as the host to the directors of the three major Russian intelligence services in Washington earlier this month.The unknown factor in the new mix is Gina Haspel, the career intelligence officer who has been nominated to be the first woman to run the C.I.A. Since she has spent much of her career undercover — details of which the agency is just beginning to release, in an effort to lobby for her confirmation — her foreign policy views are largely unknown.But her record in the terrorist detentions and interrogations following 9/11 is well documented. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who was tortured as a prisoner of war, this past week pointedly asked in a letter to Ms. Haspel, “Do you believe actions like these were justified, and do you believe they produced actionable intelligence?”At a moment when Mr. Trump has sided with the economic nationalists in his administration and ordered the imposition of tariffs on China to counter its restrictions on American companies and the forced transfer of American intellectual property, Mr. Bolton has gone one further.He has questioned whether the United States should abandon the “One China” policy that has been the underpinning of relations since the two countries resumed diplomatic relations.In 2016, Mr. Bolton wrote that confronting China “may involve modifying or even jettisoning the ambiguous ‘One China’ mantra, along with even more far-reaching initiatives to counter Beijing’s rapidly accelerating political and military aggressiveness in the South and East China Seas.”It is unclear how that squares with Mr. Trump’s campaign argument that the United States should pull its forces back from Asia unless South Korea and Japan pay more of the cost of keeping them there.But the most immediate decision facing the new team will be the benefits and costs of exiting the Iran deal. Mr. Trump cited his differences with Rex W. Tillerson on Iran in firing the secretary of state.Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo have been among the harshest critics of the nuclear accord, but they have not said how they would manage the international backlash if Mr. Trump decides, by a May 12 legislative deadline, to resume the sanctions that the United States suspended when the deal was reached.If Washington breaches the deal, Iran may declare it is now free to resume producing nuclear fuel in unlimited quantities — limits it agreed to, for 15 years, in return for economic normalization. If so, that could put the United States and Israel back where they were in the years before the accord was reached: threatening military action to destroy Iran’s facilities, even at the risk of another Middle East war. That was the path Mr. Bolton advocated.In August, when Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis wrote a joint op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal describing the merits of building economic pressure on North Korea in a policy of “strategic accountability,” Mr. Bolton said he was “appalled.”“Time is not a neutral factor here,” he said on Fox News, where he was a contributor. “More negotiation with North Korea? I think they’d say ‘bring it on.’ More time to increase the size and scope of their ballistic missile and nuclear capabilities.” He will now be preparing Mr. Trump for that negotiation.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/transgender-title-vii.html","WASHINGTON — Employers are moving to adopt or strengthen policies to prevent bias against transgender people after the latest in a series of court rulings that have extended protections for an increasingly diverse work force.A federal appeals court, rejecting the position of the Trump administration, ruled this month that transgender people are protected by a civil rights law that bans workplace discrimination based on sex.Lawyers who specialize in employment cases said that the decision, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, was highly significant. The court held that job discrimination on the basis of transgender status was inherently sex discrimination, and that the employer in this case could not claim an exemption from the law because of his religious beliefs.The case was brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an independent federal agency, on behalf of a funeral director who had been fired by a Michigan funeral home after informing the owner that she intended to transition from male to female and would dress as a woman while at work.Job discrimination based on a person’s transgender status violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the court ruled. Under the law, it said, “gender must be irrelevant to employment decisions.”The court’s conclusion is at odds with a position taken by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in October. In a memorandum to Justice Department lawyers, he said that “Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses discrimination between men and women but does not encompass discrimination based on gender identity per se, including transgender status.”The funeral home maintained that it did not violate federal law by requiring the employee to comply with a sex-specific dress code. Moreover, the owner of the home, Thomas Rost, who has been a Christian for more than 65 years, said that forcing him to employ the transgender worker would impose a substantial burden on his sincerely held religious beliefs and would therefore violate another law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.The court disagreed, saying that employees may not be discriminated against because they fail to conform to “stereotypical gender norms” — in this case, an employer’s notion of “how biologically male persons should dress, appear, behave and identify.”Discrimination based on transgender status is a form of sex discrimination, said the decision, written by Judge Karen Nelson Moore for a unanimous three-judge panel, because “an employer cannot discriminate against an employee for being transgender without considering that employee’s biological sex.”Scott Rabe, an expert on employment law at the firm Seyfarth Shaw, said that the ruling was important because “it addresses two hot-button topics in employment law: the scope of the definition of ‘sex discrimination’ under Title VII and the impact of laws protecting the free exercise of religion in the workplace.”“The ruling is a big win for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and for transgender people,” Mr. Rabe said. “The court sent a strong message that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act has minimal impact on the E.E.O.C.’s authority to enforce the anti-discrimination laws under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.”In an interview, the employee at the center of the case, Aimee Stephens, 57, said she had been shocked by her dismissal.“I had a hard time believing that a company or a person could get away with firing me because I was transgender,” Ms. Stephens said. “It didn’t seem right.” But, she said, she has since learned that “it’s a pretty common occurrence for transgender people to be fired because they are transgender or don’t meet the expectations of what another individual thinks they should be.’’In court papers, Mr. Rost said he wanted to run his business in keeping with his religious belief that “a person’s sex (whether male or female) is an immutable God-given gift and that people should not deny or attempt to change their sex.”The court decision is binding in states covered by the Sixth Circuit: Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. But its reasoning could have influence elsewhere.As it embraced a broad view of protections under Title VII, the court also rejected an expansive interpretation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.That law figured prominently in dozens of court cases in which employers challenged an Obama-era rule that required them to provide insurance coverage for contraception under the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration has proposed to roll back that requirement by offering an exemption to any employer that objects to covering birth control on the basis of religious beliefs.Doron M. Kalir, a law professor at Cleveland State University in Ohio, said the court ruling showed how judges were “extending the protection of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to a more diverse work force of gays, lesbians and transgender people.”The funeral home has not said whether it will appeal the ruling. Mr. Kalir said that at least several Supreme Court justices, if presented with the issue, would probably vote to overturn the ruling on the ground that Congress was not thinking about transgender people when it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (Mr. Kalir wrote a friend-of-the-court brief for a civil rights group, Equality Ohio, that was quoted by the appeals court.)In a separate case last year, Judge Richard A. Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, said the meaning of the civil rights law and the word “sex” had changed over the years.“It is well-nigh certain that homosexuality, male or female, did not figure in the minds of the legislators who enacted Title VII,” wrote Judge Posner, who retired from the federal bench in September. But, he said, the law “invites an interpretation that will update it to the present,” and the word “sex” in Title VII can now, after more than a half-century, be “understood to include homosexuality.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/unlock-phones-encryption.html","WASHINGTON — Federal law enforcement officials are renewing a push for a legal mandate that tech companies build tools into smartphones and other devices that would allow access to encrypted data in criminal investigations.F.B.I. and Justice Department officials have been quietly meeting with security researchers who have been working on approaches to provide such “extraordinary access” to encrypted devices, according to people familiar with the talks.Based on that research, Justice Department officials are convinced that mechanisms allowing access to the data can be engineered without intolerably weakening the devices’ security against hacking.Against that backdrop, law enforcement officials have revived talks inside the executive branch over whether to ask Congress to enact legislation mandating the access mechanisms. The Trump White House circulated a memo last month among security and economic agencies outlining ways to think about solving the problem, officials said.The F.B.I. has been agitating for versions of such a mandate since 2010, complaining that the spreading use of encryption is eroding investigators’ ability to carry out wiretap orders and search warrants — a problem it calls “going dark.”The issue repeatedly flared without resolution under the Obama administration, peaking in 2016, when the government tried to force Apple to help it break into the iPhone of one of the attackers in the terrorist assault in San Bernardino, Calif.The debate receded when the Trump administration took office, but in recent months top officials like Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, have begun talking publicly about the “going dark” problem.The National Security Council and the Justice Department declined to comment about the internal deliberations. The people familiar with the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioning that they were at a preliminary stage and that no request for legislation was imminent.But the renewed push is certain to be met with resistance.“Building an exceptional access system is a complicated engineering problem with many parts that all have to work perfectly in order for it to be secure, and no one has a solution to it,” said Susan Landau, a Tufts University computer security professor. “Any of the options people are talking about now would heighten the danger that your phone or your laptop could be hacked and data taken off of it.”Craig Federighi, the senior vice president of software engineering at Apple, stressed the importance of strengthening — not weakening — security protections for products like the iPhone, saying threats to data security were increasing every day and arguing that it was a question of “security versus security” rather than security versus privacy.“Proposals that involve giving the keys to customers’ device data to anyone but the customer inject new and dangerous weaknesses into product security,” he said in a statement. “Weakening security makes no sense when you consider that customers rely on our products to keep their personal information safe, run their businesses or even manage vital infrastructure like power grids and transportation systems.”But some computer security researchers believe the problem might be solvable with an acceptable level of new risks.A National Academy of Sciences committee completed an 18-month study of the encryption debate, publishing a report last month. While it largely described challenges to solving the problem, one section cited presentations by several technologists who are developing potential approaches.They included Ray Ozzie, a former chief software architect at Microsoft; Stefan Savage, a computer science professor at the University of California, San Diego; and Ernie Brickell, a former chief security officer at Intel.According to several people familiar with the new round of deliberations, those three men have been participating in a series of workshops convened at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Daniel Weitzner, a computer science professor. They have discussed their research with government officials, including Valerie Cofield, a senior F.B.I. science and technology official working on “going dark” issues.The researchers, Mr. Ozzie said, recognized that “this issue is not going away,” and were trying to foster “constructive dialogue” rather than declaring that no solution is possible.Mr. Savage said the talks had focused on trying to create a safe enough way to unlock data on encrypted devices, as opposed to the separate matter of decoding intercepted messages sent via encrypted communications services, like Signal and WhatsApp.“The stuff I’ve been thinking about is entirely the device problem,” he said. “I think that is where the action is. Data in motion and the cloud are much harder to deal with.”The deliberations shed new light on public remarks by Trump administration officials in recent months. In October, Mr. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, argued in a speech that permitting technology companies to create “warrant-proof encryption” was endangering society.“Technology companies almost certainly will not develop responsible encryption if left to their own devices,” he said. “Competition will fuel a mind-set that leads them to produce products that are more and more impregnable. That will give criminals and terrorists more opportunities to cause harm with impunity.”And Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, has twice given speeches this year in which he pointed to Symphony, an encrypted messaging system for banks. Pushed by a state regulator, several banks agreed to give copies of their Symphony keys to law firms. Because Symphony keeps a copy of encrypted data on its servers, that arrangement created a backup means for investigators to gain access to the messages if necessary.“At the end, the data in Symphony was still secure, still encrypted, but also accessible to the regulators so they could do their jobs,” Mr. Wray told a cybersecurity conference in Boston this month. “I’m confident that by working together and finding similar areas to agree and compromise, we can come up with solutions to the ‘going dark’ problem.”The Symphony approach, however, would not work for millions of ordinary smartphone users. But one alternative being worked on by Mr. Ozzie and others is receiving particular attention inside the government.The idea is that when devices encrypt themselves, they would generate a special access key that could unlock their data without the owner’s passcode. This electronic key would be stored on the device itself, inside part of its hard drive that would be separately encrypted — so that only the manufacturer, in response to a court order, could open it.Law enforcement officials see that idea as attractive in part because companies like Apple are already trusted to securely hold special keys permitting them to push operating system updates to devices like iPhones.Still, Ms. Landau argued that creating such a system would create significant additional security risks. She noted, among other things, that updates are relatively rare but police would want seized phones opened every day — so many more tech company employees would need access to the powerful new keys, increasing the risk of theft or abuse.The Obama administration never agreed on asking for legislation mandating access mechanisms. Military and cybersecurity agencies worried that weakening security would create new problems, and commerce officials worried about quashing innovation and making American tech products less competitive.Still, in 2016, the Obama administration’s deliberations also came to focus on the idea of access keys on devices, a participant said, but stalled because of difficult technical questions about the details. They included how to prevent criminals from deleting the access keys on their devices or from using phones that do not have the mechanism because they run on outdated software or were built for foreign markets.But one Justice Department official familiar with the deliberations contended that it might not be necessary to come up with a foolproof system, arguing that a solution that would work for ordinary, less-savvy criminals was still worth pursuing.Mr. Brickell, the former Intel official, echoed that view. Enforcing compliance with a rule that devices must have access mechanisms to function “is a difficult problem,” he said. “Let’s keep working on it. But let’s not let the desire for a perfect solution get in the way of one that would help.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/politics/fact-check-military-pay-immigrants.html","WASHINGTON — As President Trump prepared on Friday to sign a $1.3 trillion spending bill, just hours after threatening to veto it, he offered a few misleading and selectively worded claims to explain why he was reluctantly authorizing the legislation.“We looked at the veto. I looked very seriously at the veto. I was thinking about doing the veto,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. “But because of the incredible gains that we’ve been able to make for the military, that overrode any of our — any of our thinking.”But his explanation did not accurately describe just why those gains were enough to ultimately approve the spending bill. Nor did it correctly demonstrate why the legislation did not include programs that he had prioritized. Here’s a fact-check.“This will be, actually, the largest pay increase for our incredible people in over a decade.” This is imprecise and requires more context.Mr. Trump’s claim, referring to American military personnel, is slightly exaggerated. The spending bill provides a 2.4 percent pay increase for troops, the largest since the 3.4 percent pay increase that was enacted in 2010, according to the Congressional Research Service. That was eight years ago.More important, military pay increases are, by law, tied to the employment cost index, which measures private-sector wages — although the president or Congress can ask for more or less.The Pentagon requested, and Congress enacted, pay increases smaller than the index’s growth rate from 2014 through 2016. But both before and after that time — from 2011 to 2013 and 2017 to 2018 — pay for troops rose at the exact rate as the index grew.Mr. Trump’s proposed budgets for 2017 and 2018 had requested pay increases of 1.6 percent and 2.1 percent — rates that were lower than the statutory formula, and that were ultimately ignored by Congress.“For the last eight years, deep defense cuts have undermined our national security. If you look at what’s taken out, they’ve hallowed our readiness as a military unit and put America at really grave risk.” This needs context. Mr. Trump accurately noted that military officials had expressed concern about degraded troop readiness and delayed modernization of supplies. Both are what officials have described as consequences of protracted combat and budget restrictions, known as sequestration, that were imposed by Congress.It’s worth noting that military spending has decreased in recent years, after the United States withdrew combat troops from Iraq in 2011.Adjusted for inflation, total military spending swelled to more than $774 billion in the 2010 fiscal year from roughly $400 billion in the 2000 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That period was the peak of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the wars wound down, so did military spending, which declined to $583 billion by the 2017 fiscal year.War-related spending aside, the Pentagon base budget alone was still larger in 2017 than it was in 2007 or 1997. Over all, the United States spends more on its military than the next seven countries combined.“I can tell you this, and I say this to DACA recipients that the Republicans are with you. They want to get your situation taken care of. The Democrats fought us. They just fought every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill.” This is misleading. In September, Mr. Trump moved to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a program began by President Barack Obama that shielded eligible young undocumented immigrants from deportation and gave them the right to work.It is highly misleading to suggest that Democrats “fought” efforts to solidify the program into law. Democratic leaders have rejected Mr. Trump’s demand to pair the program with funding for a border wall, but that is not nearly the same as not wanting a legislative solution at all.Democrats met with Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers in January to discuss a deal, during which Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, suggested a “clean DACA bill.” At the meeting, Mr. Trump agreed.But hours later, the White House said Mr. Trump’s concept of a “clean DACA bill” included border security. Negotiations stalled, and weeks later, Democrats briefly shut down the government over the issue.In February, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, delivered an eight-hour speech about the plight of the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, in a letter dated Feb. 28, said Mr. Trump had “thwarted every bipartisan, narrow agreement that seeks to provide relief for Dreamers” and listed a few examples.And this week, several Democratic lawmakers who voted no on the spending bill said they did so because it did not contain protections for Dreamers.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/health/right-to-try-drugs-fda.html","At first glance, a bill passed by the House of Representatives this week seems like the kind of thing anyone could get behind.Known as the “Right to Try” legislation, it would allow terminally ill patients access to experimental drugs without the approval of the Food and Drug Administration.But the bill and a similar one passed last summer by the Senate do little to address the main barrier that patients face in getting unapproved treatments: permission from the drug companies themselves.In recent years, the arrival of breakthrough drugs for everything from cancer to rare diseases has led to a surge in the number of patients wanting early access to treatments. The pleas — sometimes driven by viral social media campaigns — have proved vexing for companies that have invested millions to get a drug to market and are wary of doing anything to jeopardize their chances.Today, companies’ policies on granting early access to drugs are a confusing patchwork that tends to favor affluent and well-connected patients at leading medical centers, who have the resources and know-how to navigate the system.“You have to be pretty sophisticated,” said Dr. Arthur L. Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University who has been working with companies, including Johnson & Johnson, to develop better early-access programs. But the bill passed this week, he said, “does somewhere between nothing and absolutely nothing to help you.”The bill’s passage represented a victory for proponents of “right to try,” a campaign championed by Vice President Mike Pence and initiated by the Goldwater Institute, a libertarian think tank that favors limiting the scope of the F.D.A. At least 38 states have passed local versions of right-to-try laws, which allow patients to sidestep F.D.A. approval once they have received permission from a company.The right-to-try measures are opposed by a broad coalition of groups, which contend the bill will not help patients and will undermine the authority of the primary regulatory agency, the F.D.A. Four former F.D.A. commissioners, including two each from Democratic and Republican administrations, oppose the bills, as do dozens of patient groups, including the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network and the American Lung Association.The pharmaceutical industry, while not taking a position on the issue, has been circumspect. A spokesman for its main lobbying group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said on Friday, “We believe any legislation must truly benefit and protect patients and not disrupt the future of clinical trials, U.S. Food and Drug Administration oversight and the research and approval of new medicines.”The bill’s future is unclear. On Thursday, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, failed to secure unanimous consent in the Senate to pass the House version of the bill after it was blocked by Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader from New York. Mr. Schumer said that the Senate had already passed its version and that he wanted to work on a compromise bill.In a statement, Senator Johnson said the next step would be to persuade the House to pass his version.“Patients and their families are running out of time,” Mr. Johnson said in the statement. “I promise to continue to work tirelessly on behalf of desperate patients for their right to try — their right to hope.”Supporters say that right-to-try measures will eliminate an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy — obtaining approval from the F.D.A. The legislation includes incentives they say could encourage companies to participate, such as shielding them from lawsuits and preventing the F.D.A. from considering the experiences of patients on the drugs in their eventual decisions about whether to approve them.“All we’re trying to do with Right to Try is open up another avenue for patients who need it and aren’t served by existing programs,” said Starlee Coleman, a senior policy adviser at the Goldwater Institute.The F.D.A. already approves 99 percent of such applications, and the agency has streamlined the approval process. Drug companies also have many other reasons to bar access — often, companies do not have enough extra product to give to patients, or they worry that the logistical work of granting access could slow efforts to get the drug approved, when it would become available to any patient who needed it.There is also the possibility that the drug does not work — many experimental products fail in late-stage trials.“It”s not going to fix the problem because there are still a lot of reasons why the companies will choose not to share their drugs,” said Nancy Goodman, the founder and executive director of Kids v Cancer, an advocacy group that helps connect patients with companies offering early access to treatment. Ms. Goodman’s son, Jacob, died in 2009 at age 10 of cancer, and she said she asked eight companies for access to their experimental therapies and was turned down every time.Ms. Goodman said that dying patients do need better access to drugs during what she described as the “uncomfortable” period between when there is consensus that a drug works and when it reaches the market.Still, she said of the companies, “I can understand why they say no, even though my heart was broken so many times.”Some companies said they would continue to seek F.D.A. permission, even if a right-to-try bill becomes law.“In our view, the F.D.A. plays a really important role,” Dr. Joanne Waldstreicher, the chief medical officer of Johnson & Johnson, said in an interview Thursday. Johnson & Johnson initiated a program in 2015 that delegates decisions about early access to a program set up by Dr. Caplan. The F.D.A., Dr. Waldstreicher said, has “information that we don’t have necessarily; they see safety and efficacy information on products that may be similar.”It is not always clear which patients would benefit under such a law, including those whose names are included in the bills’ title. Both the House and Senate versions carry the name of Jordan McLinn, an Indiana boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a degenerative and ultimately fatal disease with no cure. Jordan and his mother, Laura McLinn, have campaigned with Mr. Pence in favor of a law, and a video about them is featured on the Goldwater Institute website.In the video, Ms. McLinn discusses an unnamed medicine that she said she believed would allow her son to live a “long, productive life.” But in separate remarks at a public event in February, Ms. McLinn said that her son was in a clinical trial for an experimental drug.In an email message Thursday, she said, “Our journey has evolved over time with right To try,” adding, “There is not a drug that we are presently trying to access.”She said she still supported the measure because “we should have that option if it is a pathway that makes sense and works for a treatment we may want to access in the future.”Ms. Coleman, of the Goldwater Institute, said the video about the McLinns was three years old, “and all of Laura’s statements were accurate at the time and are still reflective of the situation many patients experience.”In recent years, more companies have developed formal policies on what is often called “compassionate use” in the wake of high-profile campaigns by dying patients and their families.In 2014, executives at the biotechnology company Chimerix received death threats after refusing to give an experimental drug to a 7-year-old boy, Josh Hardy of Virginia, who was dying from a viral infection. The company ultimately provided the drug to the boy, but the episode led to the departure of the chief executive, Kenneth I. Moch, who has since become a proponent of granting fairer access to experimental drugs. (In 2016, Josh died at age 10 of complications from a rare cancer.)Before the Hardy family made its request, Mr. Moch said he and his company had been flooded with pleas, ranging from longtime friends to a billionaire, seeking access to the drug, brincidofovir, which still has not been approved by the F.D.A.“You get these requests and you have to make your judgment,” he said.Since the episode, he said dozens of companies had contacted him for advice. In addition to Ms. Goodman’s group, another organization, the Reagan-Udall Foundation, also provides information about company programs.Mr. Moch and others who oppose the legislation acknowledged that it has served a positive purpose.“The only good thing I see coming out of the right-to-try legislation is the increased awareness within the medical community about expanded access,” he said.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/politics/jeff-sessions-gun-violence-bump-stocks.html","WASHINGTON — Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Friday that the Justice Department was proposing to ban so-called bump stocks through regulations rather than wait for Congress to act, a move that defies recommendations by federal law enforcement officials and could subject the department to litigation from gun rights groups.Mr. Sessions’s announcement came moments after President Trump said on Twitter that the Justice Department would imminently announce a rule banning bump stocks.It also comes amid rising public pressure on Washington to curb gun violence after a mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 people dead last month. Students will gather Saturday in Washington to protest gun violence for an event called March for Our Lives.The Justice Department’s proposed rule “would define ‘machine gun’ to include bump-stock-type devices under federal law — effectively banning them,” Mr. Sessions said in a statement.The proposed bump stock ban would defy the conclusion of Justice Department officials who have said that they could not, under existing law, stop the sales of bump stocks, accessories that allow semiautomatic guns to mimic automatic fire, and that congressional action was needed to ban them. But Mr. Sessions said the department had worked around those concerns.“After the senseless attack in Las Vegas,” Mr. Sessions said, “this proposed rule is a critical step in our effort to reduce the threat of gun violence that is in keeping with the Constitution and the laws passed by Congress.”The 55-page proposal, which was published for public comment, said it was redefining machine guns to include bump stocks because “such devices allow a shooter of a semiautomatic firearm to initiate a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger.”The proposal would force bump stock owners to surrender or destroy them the day the rule would go into effect.A previous Justice Department review, done by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, was prompted by the mass shooting last fall in Las Vegas, where a gunman killed 58 people using semiautomatic weapons outfitted with bump stocks.By working around the A.T.F.’s earlier interpretation, the Justice Department essentially said that the statute had not changed, but that it could now be read in a different way.By reinterpreting the conclusion that was made under President Barack Obama, the Justice Department could open itself up to lawsuits when the rule is finalized. Litigation would tie up the bump stock ban in the courts.Legal experts say that groups that sue could win because bump stock makers specifically designed the devices so they could not qualify as machine guns under the law.“When you pull the trigger once on a machine gun, multiple bullets fire, whereas each pull of a trigger fires a single round with bump stocks,” said Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston. “People designed it this way deliberately to keep bump stocks from being defined as machine guns under the statute. It’s like the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. The first is specifically to avoid being illegal.”The controversial new rule is in keeping with Mr. Sessions’s practice of closely hewing to White House political directives, sometimes remaining silent in the face of criticism from Mr. Trump and other times rebuking his own employees.Before the Justice Department issued any measures of its own, Mr. Trump had publicly declared that he would use executive authority to ban bump stocks, and he ordered the department to find a way to prohibit them.This month, the Justice Department announced an array of initiatives designed to address the issue of gun violence, sometimes echoing measures that had already been proposed by Mr. Trump.The department said it would help local law enforcement officials hire more school resource officers, help local firearms training programs work with teachers and help states provide faster, more accurate and complete information to databases used in federal firearms background checks. It also said it would provide a $1 million emergency grant to Florida to help cover law enforcement costs related to the Parkland shooting.Mr. Trump had said earlier that he supported the inclusion of mental health information in the background check system and the arming of teachers as part of an effort to deter school shootings.Mr. Sessions also ordered federal prosecutors to more aggressively prosecute gun buyers who lie on gun purchasing applications, a move that The New York Times reported last month.Each year, thousands of prospective gun owners who apply to buy guns through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System are found unqualified to purchase a firearm.It is a felony to lie on that application, but the crime is rarely prosecuted. From 2008 to 2015, prosecutors considered fewer than 32 cases a year, according to the Justice Department’s inspector general.“Under my tenure as attorney general, we have already increased federal gun prosecutions to a 10-year high — and we are just getting started,” Mr. Sessions said when he announced those measures.Those past directives acknowledged that gun violence is a problem, but they were unlikely to upset opponents of more restrictive gun policies. In the past, the National Rifle Association has supported some forms of bump-stock regulation, the enforcement of existing gun laws and some background check legislation.But the Justice Department’s latest move, which Mr. Sessions previewed in an announcement this month, will be met with more opposition.“You need Congress to pass a statute,” Mr. Blackman said. “That’s how you change a law, not through executive action.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/business/economy/china-tariffs-explain.html","President Trump pushed forward with a two-pronged trade offensive this week, enacting tariffs on imported aluminum and steel on Friday, a day after announcing levies on up to $60 billion in Chinese goods. The target of both actions is China, a country that Mr. Trump has called “an economic enemy” of the United States.For now, the administration has given exemptions from the first set of tariffs to multiple nations, making it clear that the main point is to curb the influx of cheap Chinese metals.Beijing’s initial response has been muted, setting the stage for what could be a methodical escalation of retaliatory measures. The Chinese government announced Friday that it planned to impose tariffs on just $3 billion in American products, including fruit, pork, wine, seamless steel pipes and more than 100 other goods. Missing were vulnerable prey like aircraft and soybeans, which experts say may come next if tensions continue to build.There’s clearly uncertainty about how the tariffs will play out. Here’s what we do know.What’s directly at stake?Markets around the world tumbled on the news of the new tariff package, but for now, the panic seems premature. Sixty billion sounds like a big number, but the reality is that the measures would barely dent the $11 trillion Chinese economy. And the Chinese retaliation for the aluminum and steel tariffs, at least initially, is even milder.Of course, the worst fears of exporters could still come true. The fact that the Chinese did not hit bigger American targets from the outset suggests that the Beijing government is guarding its most potent weapons. If Mr. Trump decides to raise the ante on the Chinese, things could get ugly.China is the United States’ third-largest export market, and a top destination for agricultural goods harvested in Trump strongholds. Beijing said that it would impose a 15 percent tariff on goods like fresh fruit, nuts, wine and seamless steel pipes, and that it was considering a second round of levies, of 25 percent, on other goods, including aluminum.Why the U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum?Mr. Trump campaigned on the promise to resurrect American steel mills, and vowed to bring those factory jobs back by stemming the flow of cheap imports into the country. The administration has accused China of flooding the world market with undervalued steel, which can make its way to the United States after landing in another country.That’s why the administration initially announced that its steel and aluminum tariffs would apply worldwide. While the tariffs are explicitly based on national security — the White House argues that the nation is vulnerable because it relies too much on foreign steel and aluminum — there are obvious economic reasons for trying to increase domestic production.But the 25 percent charge on foreign steel and 10 percent levy on aluminum will, at least for now, not apply to a broad group of allies that includes Canada, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina and the European Union. The excluded nations sent more than half of the $29 billion in steel imports that landed on American shores last year. The administration has said it may require those countries to limit their exports to the United States, and will decide whether to make the reprieve permanent by May 1.So, what’s the point of tariffs on steel if they don’t apply to the biggest foreign suppliers? The short answer is that no one — not the lawyers representing allies, the lobbyists representing steel mills or the nation’s foremost experts on trade — knows for sure what the president’s grand plan is.A good bet, trade experts say, is that Mr. Trump is using the tariffs as a bargaining chip to corral allies into adopting a harder line on China.The White House also invited other countries to negotiate their own exemptions, raising the possibility that Japan, the fifth-largest supplier of steel to American companies, could also get a break.Persuading allies to turn away cheap Chinese steel could force China to cut down production even more than it was already planning to.If the Chinese face such a disruption, “then they have to eat all that steel,” said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “I think that’s the game that’s going on here, to try to get the other countries to play the same game we are, and push the problems back on the Chinese.”As for helping the domestic producers, the early indications point in the other direction. Several steel companies are now trading lower than they were before Mr. Trump announced the tariffs, after getting an initial lift from the news.What’s the impact on American manufacturers?Making metals more expensive will annoy a lot of manufacturers — tens of thousands — that buy them to produce everything from washing machines to beer cans. But will the tariffs make it impossible for those companies to do business?Answering that question will be the task of the Commerce Department, which this week invited American executives to begin applying for exemptions. To avoid paying the tariffs on the steel or aluminum they import, businesses will need to show that American mills don’t make the piece they use, or at least don’t make enough.Railroads make some of their tracks with Japanese steel, for example, because of its unique ability to withstand pressure and extreme temperatures.Companies have to file separate requests for each type of steel or aluminum product they use. In theory, dozens of companies could ask about the same product and one company could file requests for dozens of slightly different products.Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the department could “grant blanket requests” if it became clear that a particular product couldn’t be found in the United States.American producers, meanwhile, will have the right to file an objection to each exclusion plea, piling on yet more paperwork.The Commerce Department anticipates 4,500 requests and 1,500 challenges. It will take up to 90 days for the department to respond to each.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/business/economy/housing-credit.html","When Congress voted last year to sharply reduce corporate income taxes, it undermined the nation’s largest subsidized housing program. This week’s federal spending compromise may help shore it up.The program, called the low-income housing tax credit, enables corporations to lower their taxes by helping to finance low-cost housing. Lower corporate tax rates made the credit less useful, alarming developers and agencies that provide housing for the poor in rural America and large cities.Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, negotiated a provision in the spending bill to increase the number of affordable-housing credits for the first time in a decade. Developers said the move was a needed plug in a system that is struggling with financial leaks.In a news release, Ms. Cantwell called the provision a “down payment” that “will help us deal with the tremendous deficit we have in affordable housing.”Still, according to industry analysts, the measure won’t come close to closing the gap created by the tax cut at a time when close to half of renters struggle to pay their rent and homelessness is rising in cities around the country.The low-income housing tax credit was created in 1986 as part of Congress’s last sweeping tax overhaul and has grown into a $9 billion-a-year program. It funds virtually all of the nation’s subsidized rental housing and created a sprawling industry of affordable-housing developers that now makes up a vital piece of the safety net — especially in high-cost cities like New York, San Francisco and Seattle.The program has been increasingly important in the aftermath of the Great Recession. As home building declined sharply and millennials entered the work force, the number of renters surged by about one million a year — the largest increase since the baby-boom generation came of age in the 1970s, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.Rents have risen steadily since 2010, pushing the housing cost burden to punishing levels. In 2017, about half of renters paid more than 30 percent of their income on housing, and a quarter paid more than half.The program works like this: The federal government allocates tax credits that are eventually awarded to affordable-housing developers. The credits are then transferred to corporations — usually banks — in exchange for investments in rental buildings for tenants who do not make more than 60 percent of the area’s median income. The corporations then use the credits as a coupon against future taxes.The tax bill that was passed last year amounted to a big cut in the program, because with corporations now paying lower tax rates, the credits aren’t as valuable as they once were. Even though the law has been in place only for a few months, it has already forced developers and municipal affordable-housing agencies to scramble to make up millions in funding shortfalls that emerged as the value of the credits fell.According to an analysis by Novogradac & Company, a national accounting firm based in San Francisco, the tax law will reduce the growth of subsidized affordable housing by 235,000 units over the next decade, compounding an existing shortage.Ms. Cantwell’s provision would increase the number of tax credits available, but only for four years. It would also change the income cutoff for affordable projects, making it easier for developers to secure financing.Still, even if the increase in tax credits was made permanent,  only about 30 percent of the decline in affordable housing due to last year’s tax cuts would be restored, according to Novogradac’s analysis.“It’s going to help us reclaim some of the units lost by tax reform,” said Michael Novogradac, the firm’s managing partner. “However, there’s still a large shortage of units that aren’t going to get produced or preserved, so additional action is going to be needed to get back to the production levels before tax reform.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/arts/nea-and-neh-spared-in-spending-bill.html","Arts organizations around the country can breathe a sigh of relief.Once again, Congress has rebuffed President Trump’s call to gut the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. In the new $1.3 trillion spending bill passed by Congress and signed by President Trump on Friday, both endowments actually saw a slight increase of about $3 million in their funding levels, to about $153 million each.In Mr. Trump’s first federal budget last year, he caused alarm after he became the first president to call for ending the endowments since they were created in 1965 — even though the combined budgets of both make up a mere fraction of the federal budget. Arts groups around the country mobilized immediately to save the federal funding.It turned out that the N.E.A. and N.E.H. also had support from key Republicans, including Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is the chairwoman of a crucial Senate appropriations subcommittee. (Congress writes the federal budget.) Mr. Trump called for slashing the endowments again in his second budget — and the reaction was muted from arts groups after last year’s threat didn’t come to pass.“With this funding, N.E.H. will be able to aggressively support essential cultural infrastructure projects across the country,” Jon Parrish Peede, the senior deputy chairman of the N.E.H., said in a statement. Mr. Peede was nominated by Mr. Trump to be the endowment’s chairman.A spokeswoman for the N.E.A. said, “The National Endowment for the Arts is deeply appreciative of the support of members of Congress for the agency’s mission of providing all Americans the opportunity to participate in the arts, exercise their imaginations, and develop their creative capacities.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/politics/zell-miller-feisty-democrat-who-sided-with-gop-dies-at-86.html","Zell Miller, a cantankerously independent politician from the mountains of northern Georgia who disdained backslapping and baby-kissing as he snarled at journalists and battled fellow Democrats in his four years as a United States senator, died on Friday morning at his home in Young Harris, Ga. He was 86.Lori Geary, a family spokeswoman, confirmed the death. Mr. Miller had Parkinson’s disease, she said.Mr. Miller had seemingly retired from public life by 2000, having served as governor, lieutenant governor, state senator and, in the beginning of his political career, small-town mayor — of Young Harris, near the North Carolina border.Then, on July 18, 2000, Senator Paul Coverdell, a Republican, died unexpectedly. Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, appointed Mr. Miller to Mr. Coverdell’s seat.Mr. Miller was easily elected in November 2000 to serve the remaining four years of Mr. Coverdell’s term. Bristling at attempts to make him follow “a party goose step,” as he put it later, Mr. Miller joined Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, to co-sponsor President George W. Bush’s $1.6 billion tax-cut measure in early 2001.“I agree with President Bush that the taxpayers are better judges of how to spend their own money than we are,” Mr. Miller said. He was also one of only eight Democratic senators to support the confirmation of John Ashcroft, Mr. Bush’s choice for attorney general. Soon, he stopped going to weekly lunches with Democratic senators.Mr. Miller most famously demonstrated his independence at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City, where he delivered a blistering attack on the Democratic nominee, Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, a man he had called “an American hero” only a few years before in tribute to Mr. Kerry’s service in Vietnam.By 2004, Mr. Miller had soured on Mr. Kerry, citing several votes in the Senate as evidence that he had gone soft on defense issues.“This is the man who wants to be the commander in chief of the U.S. Armed Forces?” Mr. Miller told the crowd at Madison Square Garden. “U.S. forces armed with what? Spitballs?”Immediately after the speech, Mr. Miller snapped at journalists who tried to pose questions. Then he was interviewed on MSNBC by Chris Matthews, who cited the about-face on Mr. Kerry and asked him to elaborate on the “spitballs” remark.“Do you know what a metaphor is?” Mr. Miller said. Quickly becoming more annoyed, he shouted, “Get out of my face!”Mr. Matthews was actually a safe distance away; the two were communicating by microphone.“I wish we lived in the day when we could challenge someone to a duel,” Mr. Miller said. He later expressed regret for his outburst.The 2004 speech was all the more remarkable in that Mr. Miller had delivered a keynote speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention in which he excoriated President George H. W. Bush and praised the party’s nominee, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who would go on to defeat Mr. Bush. Mr. Miller attributed his own rise to the achievements of the Democratic Party.“I made it because Franklin Delano Roosevelt energized this nation,” Mr. Miller told the convention, which was also being held at Madison Square Garden. “I made it because Harry Truman fought for working families like mine. I made it because John Kennedy’s rising tide lifted even our tiny boat. I made it because Lyndon Johnson showed America that people who were born poor didn’t have to die poor.”Zell Bryan Miller was born in Young Harris on Feb. 24, 1932. His father, Stephen Grady Miller, a teacher, died 17 days later. The widowed mother, Birdie, built a home with rocks that she had hauled from a nearby stream, Zell Miller recounted later, and raised the boy and his sister, Jane.Mr. Miller attended Young Harris College before transferring to Emory University in Atlanta. Finding his life lacking in direction or purpose, he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1953 and enrolled at the University of Georgia three years later, earning a bachelor’s degree and a master’s in history.In 1954, he married Shirley Carver, who survives him, as do two sons, Murphy and Matthew; four grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.He taught history and political science at Young Harris College and was elected mayor of Young Harris, serving in 1959 and 1960. He was then elected to two two-year terms in the State Senate. Next, he was executive secretary for Gov. Lester Maddox of Georgia from 1968 to 1971. He was credited with exerting a moderating influence on Mr. Maddox, a segregationist, and spurring him to appoint blacks to his administration.Beginning in 1975, Mr. Miller spent 16 years as lieutenant governor under George Busbee and Joe Frank Harris, serving in that post longer than anyone else in Georgia history. He ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate seat in 1980, was elected governor in 1990 and re-elected in 1994.As governor, Mr. Miller fought to have the Confederate battle emblem removed from the state flag, supported tough sentences for repeat criminal offenders and pushed legislation providing more money for public schools and scholarships for high school students. By the time he stepped down, after his second term, he was one of the most popular politicians in Georgia history.While in the Senate, Mr. Miller campaigned on behalf of Senator Max Cleland, a fellow Georgia Democrat, in Mr. Cleland’s unsuccessful bid for re-election in 2002.Yet as a former senator in 2008, Mr. Miller supported Senator Saxby Chambliss, the Republican who had unseated Mr. Cleland, asserting that Mr. Chambliss “could well be the last man standing between a far, far left liberal agenda sailing through the Senate.” Mr. Chambliss won re-election.Mr. Miller acquired the nickname “Zigzag Zell” among some Democratic Party leaders. As he crossed into his senior years, he often endorsed Republicans in Georgia races. Yet he always insisted that he would be a Democrat “until I die,” and that the party had abandoned him on some issues, not the other way around.So why did he remain in the Democratic Party?“I compare it to being in an old house,” he said just before he left the Senate. “It’s a house that I’ve lived in for years that’s getting kind of drafty and hard to heat. The plumbing won’t work, and some strangers have moved into the basement, and I don’t know who they are, and there’s no doubt I would be more comfortable in another house. But, you see, I was here first. I’ve lived in this house for years and years. It’s home, and I’m not going to leave.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/politics/iranians-hacking-scheme-irgc.html","WASHINGTON — Nine Iranians stole secrets from American government agencies, universities and companies in a yearslong cyberattack, federal law enforcement officials said on Friday, calling out Tehran amid fears that the Trump administration will dismantle the Iran nuclear deal.The suspects worked as managers, contractors, associates and hackers for hire at the Mabna Institute, based in Iran, a contractor for the Iranian government working on behalf of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which benefited from the sensitive information obtained in the hacking, the officials said.The suspects live in Iran and will not be extradited; the United States and Iran have no diplomatic relations. Though they are unlikely to ever be arrested, the Justice Department has used indictments against foreign citizens to signal to outside powers that they have crossed a line, including the indictments against 13 Russians last month accusing them of interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.Because of the indictments, the Iranians will not be able to travel abroad without risk of arrest, and the Treasury Department also imposed sanctions on them as well as on the Mabna Institute.“Hostile individuals, organizations and nation-states have taken note of our success,” Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, said at a news conference on Friday. “They increasingly attempt to profit from America’s ingenuity by infiltrating our computer systems, stealing our intellectual property and evading our controls on technology exports.”The hacking case comes at a tenuous time for the fragile relationship between the United States and Iran. The Trump administration is threatening to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, the accord reached in 2015 between Iran and six world powers that limited nuclear programs in exchange for sanctions relief.President Trump has said he wants to impose harsh sanctions on Iran, a move that could compel Iran to leave the agreement.Security experts worry that if Mr. Trump follows through on his threats to dismantle the agreement — he announced on Thursday that John R. Bolton, an opponent of the deal, would be his next national security adviser — American companies will be targeted in an increasing number of cyberattacks from Iran.“The nuclear deal imposed a constraint on them, and when the deal goes away, so does their constraint,” said James A. Lewis, a digital security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.Targets could include critical infrastructure in the United States, in attacks like those on Saudi petrochemical companies over the past year that experts at Symantec suspect were the work of Iran.The Iranian government first employed online breaches to combat domestic political opposition and then turned its focus overseas in a series of escalating attacks on private companies in the United States and its allies, according to multiple reports by American intelligence officials and private digital security firms.Private security researchers and intelligence officials who have tracked Iranian cyberactivity say the country has increasingly relied on proxy forces — a mix of contractors, volunteers, patriotic hackers and engineers at Iranian universities, and even its religious schools — to strike at Iran’s geopolitical enemies.“Relying on these irregulars and contractors gives the state some semblance of deniability,” Mr. Lewis said.Over the past five years, Iranian hackers demonstrated increasing sophistication, with a spate of attacks that took down the online banking websites of some dozen United States banks in late 2012. That same year, government officials and private researchers at CrowdStrike tied Iranian hackers to a digital strike at Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil company, which wiped data on some 30,000 Aramco machines, replacing it with an image of a burning American flag.Less than two years later, Iranian hackers pulled off a similar feat at the Sands Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, after its owner, Sheldon Adelson, advocated a nuclear strike on Iran. The hackers deployed malware that brought the casino’s operations to a halt, wiped data off its machines, replaced websites with a photograph of Mr. Adelson with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and signed their online screeds the “Anti W.M.D. Team.”But security experts note that Iranian attacks have dropped off since the signing of the nuclear deal. “They’ve been on their best behavior because of the nuclear deal,” Mr. Lewis said. “To avoid having the nuclear deal collapse, they have not been willing to risk it.”But on Friday, the government said that a new group of hackers stole innovative work and intellectual property from the computer systems of 144 American universities, the Labor Department, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the states of Hawaii and Indiana.They also infiltrated the United Nations, 176 universities in 21 countries around the world, and dozens of domestic and foreign companies, some in banking, health care and the law, the officials said.In a scheme that continued for more than four years, the Mabna Institute is accused of stealing more than 31 terabytes of academic data and intellectual property, as well as the contents of employee email accounts. The hackers sent so-called phishing emails to unsuspecting people, who gave them access to their computers after opening those emails.The scheme “should send a message around the world about Iran’s continued deceptive practices,” Sigal P. Mandelker, the Treasury Department’s under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said during the news conference.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/business/china-tariffs-response.html","BEIJING — In a tit-for-tat trade battle with the United States, China’s response has so far been restrained.But that is with good reason: As it waits to see how far President Trump plans to go in imposing sweeping tariffs on China, Beijing knows that it has more effective weapons in its arsenal.China’s Ministry of Commerce said on Friday that it would impose tariffs on $3 billion worth of American-produced fruit, pork, wine, seamless steel pipes and more than 100 other products. The move was in response to the Trump administration’s announcements that it would apply tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum, and came hours after Mr. Trump said he would impose tariffs on about $60 billion worth of Chinese-made products.Beijing said it would challenge the penalties at the World Trade Organization, and would carry out its trade restrictions in accordance with W.T.O. rules.Analysts say the latest round of United States tariffs, if imposed, would likely have a minimal impact on the Chinese economy. While Mr. Trump chose confrontational language toward China in announcing his latest move, actual details were sparse and amounted in many ways to a threat as opposed to an actual imposition of tariffs.But the escalating tensions, and the prospect of further action by China, have nevertheless raised concerns.“We do seem to be entering a trade war,” said Eswar Prasad, a senior professor of trade policy at Cornell University. “The U.S. has unsheathed its sword after an extended period of saber rattling, and the Chinese are now unsheathing their weapons.”“I hope this will not spiral into a very broad set of sanctions on both sides,” he said, “but I think, given Mr. Trump’s instincts and his very keen desire to deliver a political win whatever the political fallout might be, I don’t think it can be tamped down now.”Stock markets in Asia slid on news of the escalating trade confrontation. By the close of trade on Friday, benchmark stock indexes in Hong Kong and Shanghai had fallen 2.5 percent and 3.4 percent respectively, tracking an overnight drop in Wall Street.The American restrictions announced on Thursday would include tariffs of 25 percent on a list of specific goods, a proposal that is set to be made in the coming days, followed by a 30-day public consultation. During that time, the administration may hold more talks with the Chinese government, and lobbyists will wage an energetic fight to have their employers’ products removed from the list.The loss to China from the planned tariffs would amount to no more than 0.1 percent of its economic output, according to Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics. JPMorgan said the potentially affected exports from China would account for 2.2 percent of the country’s total exports, which totaled about $2.3 trillion in 2017.“The upshot is that today’s tariffs amount to no more than a slap on the wrist for China,” Mr. Williams wrote in a note.China would charge a 15 percent tariff on the American-produced products listed in Friday’s announcement.Another round of tariffs could be imposed on a second group of American-made goods after China evaluates the impact of the American trade measures against China. That group would be charged 25 percent tariffs. It said businesses and other parties had until March 31 to submit views about the retaliatory tariffs, meaning they could take effect only after that date.But there are many ways that China, America’s biggest foreign creditor and its third-largest export market, could intensify its response. In particular, it could add aircraft and soybeans — both enormous American industries for which China is a critical market — to its list of restricted items. The United States exports $12.4 billion worth of soybeans to China, and analysts say that Boeing, which competes against Airbus of Europe to sell jetliners to Chinese carriers, is another obvious target.“China does not want to fight a trade war but is absolutely not afraid of a trade war,” a Commerce Ministry representative said in a statement. “We are confident and capable of meeting any challenge and hope that the United States will pause on the brink of a precipice, make careful decisions and avoid dragging bilateral trade relations to a dangerous place.”For now, the proposed Chinese penalties appear to be a carefully calibrated response to the American steel and aluminum tariffs, which took effect on Friday. Beijing’s restrictions would affect $2.97 billion worth of American steel, aluminum and pork. That is roughly equivalent to the $2.79 billion worth of steel and aluminum that China exported to the United States last year, according to Commerce Department data.The goods that Beijing plans to penalize represents about 2 percent of the total size of American exports to China, according to Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.“It’s not devastating economically by any stretch, but it’s certainly going to hurt those interests in the United States that are trying to export,” Mr. Bown said. He pointed out that the retaliation by China sent “a negative signal, that they are not seeking to de-escalate things.”China also picked its targets carefully by choosing goods that had political resonance, akin to what the European Union did this month by targeting bourbon, bluejeans and motorcycles, products made in states with Republican politicians or that supported Mr. Trump in his 2016 election victory. In China’s case, pork comes from Nebraska and the Midwest, states that backed Mr. Trump.“I would say that China’s proposal is quite restrained,” said Song Guoyou, deputy director of the American studies center at Fudan University in Shanghai. Mr. Song characterized China’s response as “cautious anger.”That may not last for long, as the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing widens.In February, China opened an anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into sorghum imports from the United States, less than two weeks after the United States said it was imposing tariffs on solar panels and washing machines that were aimed at curbing cheap imports from China and South Korea.“China is still being moderate and is appropriately counterattacking,” said Li Qiang, chief consultant at Shanghai JC Intelligence Company, an agriculture consulting firm. “Both sides appear to be sounding each other out.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/politics/bolton-cambridge-analyticas-facebook-data.html","WASHINGTON — The political action committee founded by John R. Bolton, President Trump’s incoming national security adviser, was one of the earliest customers of Cambridge Analytica, which it hired specifically to develop psychological profiles of voters with data harvested from tens of millions of Facebook profiles, according to former Cambridge employees and company documents.Mr. Bolton’s political committee, known as The John Bolton Super PAC, first hired Cambridge in August 2014, months after the political data firm was founded and while it was still harvesting the Facebook data.In the two years that followed, Mr. Bolton’s super PAC spent nearly $1.2 million primarily for “survey research,” which is a term that campaigns use for polling, according to campaign finance records.But the contract between the political action committee and Cambridge, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, offers more detail on just what Mr. Bolton was buying. The contract broadly describes the services to be delivered by Cambridge as “behavioral microtargeting with psychographic messaging.”To do that work, Cambridge used Facebook data, according to the documents and two former employees familiar with the work.“The data and modeling Bolton’s PAC received was derived from the Facebook data,” said Christopher Wylie, a data expert who was part of the team that founded Cambridge Analytica. “We definitely told them about how we were doing it. We talked about it in conference calls, in meetings.”Cambridge Analytica, which rose to prominence through its work with Mr. Trump’s 2016 election campaign, has found itself confronting a deepening crisis since reports this past weekend in The New York Times and The Observer of London that the firm had harvested the data from more than 50 million Facebook profiles in its bid to develop techniques for predicting the behavior of individual American voters.Cambridge’s so-called psychographic modeling techniques, which were built in part with the data harvested from Facebook, underpinned its work for Mr. Trump’s campaign in 2016, setting off a furious — and still unsettled — debate about whether the firm’s technology worked. The same techniques were also the focus of its work for Mr. Bolton’s super PAC.“The Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was becoming limp wristed and spineless and it wanted research and messaging for national security issues,” Mr. Wylie said.“That really meant making people more militaristic in their worldview,” he added. “That’s what they said they wanted, anyway.”Using the psychographic models, Cambridge helped design concepts for advertisements for candidates supported by Mr. Bolton’s PAC, including the 2014 campaign of Thom Tillis, the Republican senator from North Carolina, according to Mr. Wylie and another former employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being dragged into the investigations that now appear to be engulfing Cambridge.One advertisement, a video that was posted on YouTube, was aimed at people who scored high for conscientiousness, and were thought to respect hard work and experience. It emphasized Mr. Bolton’s time working for Ronald Reagan and how Mr. Tillis embodied the spirit and political ethos of the late president.Beyond their conservative politics, Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolton and Cambridge Analytica all share a patron — the Mercer family of Long Island, whose patriarch, Robert L. Mercer, made a fortune at the helm of a top-yielding hedge fund.Cambridge Analytica, which grew out of the London-based SCL Group, was founded in 2014 with a $15 million investment from Mr. Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah sits on the firm’s board of directors. Stephen K. Bannon was also a co-founder.At the same time, Mr. Mercer was financially supporting Mr. Bolton’s PAC, donating $5 million between April 2014 and September 2016, according to Federal Election Commission filings. The Mercers also backed Mr. Trump in the presidential election.The Mercer family has not publicly commented since the reports about the misuse of Facebook data by Cambridge first surfaced in The Times and The Observer.The reports have prompted calls from lawmakers in Britain and the United States for renewed scrutiny of Facebook, and at least two American state prosecutors have said they are looking into the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.The company also suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after a television broadcast this week in which he was recorded suggesting that the company had used seduction and bribery to entrap politicians and influence foreign elections.But it is the harvesting of Facebook data that has cast the harshest spotlight on Cambridge, and Mr. Bolton’s experience with the company appears to have provided a model for how it sold itself to future political campaigns, including Mr. Trump’s.The firm took the psychographic profiles it was building off the Facebook data at the time and combined them with voter databases and other sets of data. Staff from SCL’s elections division, which through a convoluted corporate structure was interchangeable with Cambridge, discussed what they were doing at a meeting in July 2014 with another contractor for the Bolton PAC, according to an agenda of the meeting obtained by The Times.The profiles would be used to “identify the personality traits of individuals” in states to be targeted by the Bolton PAC, said the agenda, which was prepared for SCL and Cambridge staff. “Individuals can be targeted with the right message,” it said.The agenda also included a line, in boldfaced text, that said SCL wanted to use voter contact lists available to Bolton’s campaign to direct people “toward the FB app.” Cambridge, working through an outside researcher, used a Facebook app to harvest data from the social network’s profiles. The app claimed to be collecting data for academic research, and users were not aware of its true purpose.Months later, the relationship between Cambridge and the Bolton PAC had grown so close that the firm was writing up talking points for Mr. Bolton. In an email dated Oct. 1, 2014, Cambridge staff outlined a few sentences that Mr. Bolton could use to describe the work the new firm was doing for his super PAC.“It’s not just about how much you spend. It’s also about how smart you spend,” the email advised Mr. Bolton to say.“One way we’re doing that is by enlisting an outside firm” — Cambridge Analytica — “to provide deepdive research into who makes up our audience of target voters,” it continued. “We are producing ads specifically designed for voters of a certain personality and demographic profile. So if you’re a young woman in New Hampshire with a specific kind of personality and a particular set of issues that you care about, our research allows us to connect with that voter in a way that truly resonates with her.”The subject line of the email: “Did Bannon come back to you on this?”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/kris-kobach-kansas-governor.html","KANSAS CITY, Kan. — Day after day, Kris W. Kobach, the secretary of state of Kansas, grilled people on the witness stand about voter fraud. From behind a courtroom lectern, he questioned the effectiveness of national election law. Sometimes he endured verbal lashings on proper legal procedure from the exasperated judge.And Kansans watched and wondered: Should they make him their next governor?Appearing as both defendant and lawyer, Mr. Kobach, a Republican who last year announced a run for governor, was at the center of a trial that concluded on Monday in the Robert J. Dole Federal Courthouse. A hard-liner on issues of illegal immigration and voting restrictions, he is fighting to preserve a voter registration law requiring Kansans to show proof of citizenship to register to vote.Mr. Kobach, 51, has established himself as a leading voice claiming widespread voter fraud, serving last year as the vice chair of a short-lived presidential commission on the issue. A Trump ally and familiar face on cable news, he is testing whether he can leverage his national profile to win an office higher than the relatively obscure post of secretary of state.The court battle has offered Mr. Kobach, who is in a competitive field of Republicans running for governor, a public forum to lay out his claims of voter fraud even as President Trump’s commission was abruptly disbanded without making a case that there is a pervasive problem.Critics say that Mr. Kobach is wildly exaggerating the potential of noncitizens casting ballots and, in the process, disenfranchising lawful voters, especially minorities, young people and the poor. Experts on election law tend to agree that voter fraud is not a common problem in American elections.The trial is the result of a lawsuit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in 2016 against Mr. Kobach on behalf of the League of Women Voters and individual Kansans. Whatever the outcome — a judge is not expected to render a verdict for at least a month — much rests on what people in this conservative state come away thinking.“With Kobach, you either love him or hate him,” said Stuart Clark, a Republican from Lenexa, Kan., as he wandered through a shopping mall in Overland Park, south of Kansas City, on the first evening of the trial. “Sometimes, I think he pushes at the edge a little too much. But overall, I like what he says, and I guess he figures he can defend the law as well as anybody.”Mr. Clark, who owns a plumbing business, said he supported Mr. Kobach’s efforts on voter identification laws.“Why would you have a problem having to show an I.D.?” he said. “We show I.D. for so many things. It just seems like common sense.”Others are less convinced by Mr. Kobach’s claims that voter fraud is pervasive and widespread. “To me, it’s a fix to a problem that doesn’t exist,” said Jeff Nielsen, standing behind the counter of a pawnshop he manages in Olathe, Kan. Mr. Nielsen, who works in Kansas, lives across the border in Missouri, grew up Republican and supports gun ownership — a wall of rifles was behind him in the shop — but now votes for Democrats. “I think Kobach should be a little more concerned with Russians picking our president than with Mexicans voting,” he said.In 2016, Federal District Judge Julie A. Robinson in Kansas ruled that the proof-of-citizenship requirement of the state law that Mr. Kobach championed violated federal law. If Judge Robinson rules against Mr. Kobach in the current trial, thousands of Kansans who attempted to register to vote at a Department of Motor Vehicles office but did not provide proof of citizenship will see their registrations reinstated. If Mr. Kobach prevails, it could become more difficult for residents without proof of citizenship to vote in the 2018 elections.Early in the trial, Judge Robinson reprimanded Mr. Kobach, who frequently stumbled on legal procedure, for attempting to display documents that had not been formally introduced as evidence. “Evidence 101 — not going to do it,” she said.In his opening statements, Mr. Kobach, Harvard-educated and Yale Law School-trained, criticized current rules as weak and porous, arguing that a requirement that voters attest on a form at the Department of Motor Vehicles that they are citizens — risking a penalty of perjury for a false statement — is not enough. “All you had to do was check a box,” he said. “That was essentially it.”Mr. Kobach says that even though he has documented a relatively small number of noncitizens in Kansas who have attempted to vote, he has reason to believe that they are only “the tip of the iceberg” and that thousands more exist on the state voter rolls.But Dale Ho, a lawyer for the A.C.L.U., said that the law Mr. Kobach lobbied for has made it difficult or impossible for some state residents who do not have a birth certificate, passport or other proof of citizenship to vote. Experts in election law say that noncitizens successfully voting rarely happens.“Enforcing this law is like taking a bazooka to a fly,” Mr. Ho said. “The collateral damage in this case has been thousands of Kansas voters.”In his closing statements on Monday, Mr. Ho added, “The iceberg, on close inspection, your honor, it’s more of an ice cube.”The trial made headlines around the state for two weeks and was closely watched in Johnson County, a densely populated cluster of suburbs outside of Kansas City. The county is home to close to 600,000 of Kansas’s 2.9 million residents, including Jeff Colyer, the state’s new governor, who still keeps a plastic surgery practice there. Mr. Kobach, who has been secretary of state in Kansas since 2011, was a member of the Overland Park City Council in Johnson County from 1999 to 2001.Sam Brownback, a Republican who served as Kansas’s governor for seven years, left office last month to take an ambassadorship in Washington, leaving Mr. Colyer, formerly the lieutenant governor, leading the state. Mr. Kobach intends to challenge Mr. Colyer for the Republican nomination in an August primary; the general election will take place in November.A poll in February showed Mr. Kobach locked in a tight race with Mr. Colyer, who kept a low profile during his years as lieutenant governor and whose positions are something of a mystery to many Kansans. Half of the Republican voters in the poll had no opinion of Mr. Colyer, while a little more than one-third had a favorable opinion.For his part, Mr. Kobach has a far more visible national profile as an ally of Mr. Trump and a familiar face on cable news.At the Wooden Spoon restaurant in Overland Park, Victor Vallejo and Therese Allinder, both Republicans, said they had been hearing news of the Kobach trial and were encouraged that he was fighting for stricter measures on voting.But Ms. Allinder, 57, an architect, said that did not translate to an automatic vote in the primary election for Mr. Kobach, whose single-minded focus can leave her unsettled. “He’s so extreme,” she said. “Brownback could never admit when he made a mistake. He made the state go broke with that tax cut, and he could never say, ‘I messed up.’ Kobach reminds me of him.”Mr. Vallejo, 71, her companion, said he knew little about Mr. Colyer, the governor, but that Mr. Kobach was a familiar face. He welcomed Mr. Kobach’s message on immigration and voting rights. “I like Trump, so I like Kobach,” he said. “He’s on my side of the aisle.”Mr. Kobach did not respond to a request for comment.Democrats say they have tried to blot out the noise from the trial. At a recent forum in Topeka, seven candidates from the Democratic side took the stage, but the party has yet to coalesce around a single contender. To stand a chance in conservative Kansas, the Democratic nominee must attract significant numbers of independents and moderate Republicans.At a mall in Overland Park, Larry Altman, a Democrat and retired lawyer who occasionally does volunteer work for the A.C.L.U. on education issues, shook his head at the mention of Mr. Kobach’s role in the courtroom that day.‘You know the saying,” he said. “‘He who represents himself has a fool for a client.’”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/politics/harry-reid-leaves-washington.html","WASHINGTON — Harry Reid knows off the top of his head that 351 is the DirecTV channel for C-Span coverage of the Senate at his home in Nevada. But he says he rarely turns to it.“I never look,” said Mr. Reid, who then grudgingly offered, “O.K., maybe every couple of months.”But Mr. Reid, who couldn’t get enough of the Senate floor during nearly two decades in the Democratic leadership, doesn’t need to follow the Senate obsessively to be certain that he doesn’t like what’s going on in Washington these days.“I just shake my head is all I can do,” said Mr. Reid, who has been spending most of his time in Las Vegas. “I feel sad,” he said, grappling to describe his sentiments, particularly about what he sees as a Republican refusal to directly challenge President Trump on an array of troubling subjects.“I can’t fathom the Republicans doing what they do — nothing, nothing, it doesn’t matter what he does,” he said, referring to Mr. Trump. “Why would they be afraid of him? It should be just the opposite. I don’t expect them to be nit-picking him on every little thing he does wrong. But shouldn’t somebody be saying something about something?”Mr. Reid emphasizes that he is not angry or bitter. But he says he feels so disconnected from Washington that he is selling his apartment in the Ritz-Carlton here and plans to be in the nation’s capital only infrequently.“I don’t want to be here,” Mr. Reid said. “My life’s not the Senate anymore.”To some, that is no doubt good news. Mr. Reid was a tough adversary, an acerbic foe always ready to slug it out with Republicans, and he left behind many detractors when he retired at the end of 2016.Now, like previous Washington figures who either exited voluntarily, as he did, or were unceremoniously shown the door, Mr. Reid is discovering that once you are out, you are really out. Of course, there is always sticking around to lobby — “I would rather be taken to Singapore and caned” is his quip on that line of work. But absent a job that requires a major presence here, those who have been at the political top are often surprised to find the Capitol — and the capital — don’t hold the same allure once they step down.Plus, he said, there is no one to hang out with.“Nobody lives here anymore,” said Mr. Reid, who served as both the majority and minority leader. “When I came here, people lived here, they had their families, but not anymore. It wasn’t that way before. We made friends not only of the members, but of their families, their children. It is so changed.”To get a last bit of that old-home feel, Mr. Reid organized a luncheon on Thursday for about a dozen of his fellow former colleagues, at the MGM National Harbor casino resort outside the capital. It was a who’s who of former Senate Democrats, including Tom Daschle, Christopher J. Dodd, Blanche Lincoln, Mary Landrieu, Robert Torricelli, Ben Nelson, Joseph I. Lieberman, Paul Sarbanes, Ken Salazar, Max Baucus, Mark Pryor and Russ Feingold.Long an advocate for his state’s gaming and tourism industry, Mr. Reid is a consultant to MGM. The company also supports a public policy institute at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, that Mr. Reid oversees with John A. Boehner, a Republican and the former House speaker with whom Mr. Reid both cooperated and clashed during their time together in Congress. Mr. Reid is also a fellow at the university’s law school. He says those roles have proved more gratifying than anticipated.“When I left here, I said I was going to live in the future, not the past,” Mr. Reid said. “But I didn’t believe it.” As it turns out, he said: “I love my job. I am so satisfied with what I am doing.”In his final years in the Senate, Mr. Reid had to cope with the consequences of a terrible accident at the start of 2015, when exercising with a resistance band in his home. He suffered multiple serious injuries and lost sight in his right eye. As he tried to recover and simultaneously run the Senate for two challenging years, Mr. Reid at times struggled physically. But his time away from Washington has reaped benefits and he appears much more fit and steady on his feet.“I’m doing fine, better than I was, for sure,” he acknowledged.Even before Mr. Trump won the election, he and Mr. Reid had traded caustic barbs, like when Mr. Trump dismissed the then Senate leader with the crack that “he should go back and start working out again with his rubber workout pieces.” It was not the sort of comment Mr. Reid was likely to let pass.“I may not be able to see out of my right eye, but with my good eye, I can see that Trump is a man who inherited his money and spent his entire life pretending like he earned it,” Mr. Reid said, among other digs.But this week, he reserved some of the strongest criticism for his former Republican colleagues led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. He noted that they remain largely mum as the president’s conduct is under wide-ranging scrutiny, including his possible relationship with a pornographic film actress, the special counsel’s inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and the surrounding turmoil in the administration. Mr. Reid also noted that Mr. Trump has undermined federal law enforcement officials and disrespected “wonderful, wonderful people who serve in the bowels in the State Department.”“Pick any one thing you want,” Mr. Reid said about the president. “No one says anything. They have become acolytes for Trump. Can you imagine if Obama had done any of this stuff?” Mr. Reid asked, asserting that the former president’s Democratic colleagues in the Senate would never have remained quiet.Mr. Reid said Senate Republicans had forgotten the view of one of the institution’s staunchest protectors — Robert C. Byrd, who used to remind his colleagues, “I don’t serve under the president, I serve with the president.”“Think of how Senator Byrd would look at this,” Mr. Reid said. “I can’t understand it. I guess the Senate is not what it used to be.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/business/economy/tipping-workers.html","The Trump administration has backed away from a proposed regulation that would have allowed restaurant owners and managers to pocket the tips of their workers.The change was negotiated by Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, and Labor Secretary R. Alexander Acosta after the proposal encountered months of opposition. Labor advocacy groups argued that the regulation would transfer billions of dollars from workers to employers.The restaurant industry had backed the proposal, saying it would allow the tips given to waiters and waitresses to be shared with so-called back-of-house workers, like cooks and dishwashers.Under the compromise, inserted into the congressional spending bill that won final approval early Friday, federal law would be revised to make clear that employers cannot under any circumstances keep any portion of the tips earned by their workers.Tips could be redistributed to non-tipped workers only if employers pay all their employees the regular minimum wage in their jurisdiction, as opposed to the lower minimum wage that most states allow for tipped workers.The tip pool would also have to exclude supervisors, managers and owners. Under the Labor Department’s proposed regulation, a tip pool could have included those groups.“This protects workers from employers and managers skimming their tips and sets up conditions for better wage justice in restaurants and bars across the country,” said Judy Conti, government affairs director at the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group.Angelo I. Amador, a senior official at the National Restaurant Association, an industry trade group, said in a statement that he was pleased that the new legislation would make it possible for cooks, dishwashers and other workers to share tips. But he expressed concern that “the enforcement and penalty language for unintentional violations goes too far.”The provision would give the secretary of labor broader authority to impose civil penalties on employers who steal tips. For example, workers currently must show that the theft was repeated or willful. Now, civil penalties could be applied to any instance of tip theft.In addition to restaurant workers, the rules would apply to tipped employees in other fields, like hairstylists and manicurists.The proposed regulation came under particular fire after a report in February that the Labor Department had scaled down its projection for the amount that might be transferred from workers to their bosses, and then abandoned the projection altogether under pressure from Mr. Acosta and the Labor Department.It is standard practice for proposed regulations with more than $100 million in economic impact to include an economic analysis, and the Office of Management and Budget typically insists on abiding by that protocol.After reports emerged that the analysis had been spiked, Democrats in Congress demanded an investigation into the matter and the Labor Department’s inspector general opened an inquiry.The compromise began to take shape this month. During testimony by Mr. Acosta before a congressional committee on March 6, Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, questioned him about the absence of an economic analysis in the proposed regulation and pressed him on why anyone other than workers should be allowed a share of their tips.Mr. Acosta said he did not personally favor allowing managers and owners to siphon tips. But he said the law governing the question, the Fair Labor Standards Act, did not give him the authority to prevent employers from taking tips if the workers were paid the standard minimum wage.Around the same time, Ms. Murray, the senator from Washington, began negotiations with Mr. Acosta, leading to the provision that was inserted into the spending bill.“I’m pleased that Secretary Acosta listened, reversed course and worked with me on legislation to make sure that big businesses can’t steal their workers’ tips,” Ms. Murray said in a statement.The agreement renders portions of the Labor Department’s proposed regulation invalid, but it is unclear whether the department will officially withdraw it. The department did not respond to a request for comment.It is possible that some high-earning tipped workers would do worse under the compromise. Restaurants would be permitted to set up pools that redistribute their tips to colleagues who often don’t earn tips now.But according to Saru Jayaraman, president of the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a worker advocacy group, the vast majority of workers would benefit from the compromise provision, because such tip-pooling is linked to workers receiving the regular minimum wage, as opposed to the tipped minimum wage, which can be several dollars per hour lower.For example, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, while the federal tipped minimum wage is $2.13 per hour. Employers who pay tipped workers below $7.25 per hour must make up any difference between that amount and what their workers receive in base wages and tips. (Many cities and states have a far higher minimum wage.)The compromise’s minimum wage requirement changes the math in the employees’ favor. Any restaurant setting up a tip pool that involves non-tipped workers would have to be paying its tipped workers the regular minimum wage, not the reduced wage.Workers who previously made $3.25 per hour from their employer and $4 in tips would instead receive their share of the tip pool on top of a $7.25 minimum wage. Even if such workers received slightly less than their usual $4 per hour in tips because some portion of that money was being redistributed, they would almost certainly fare better than if they kept all their tips but had a lower base wage.Ms. Jayaraman pointed to an analysis by her group showing that tipped workers, including the most highly paid tipped workers, typically earn more in the seven states that have done away with the tipped-worker minimum wage than in the states that haven’t.“No one tips based on how much you’re earning,” said Ms. Jayaraman, whose group strongly supported the legislative compromise. “They tip the same amount, and your wages go up.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/karen-mcdougal-interview.html","The former Playboy model Karen McDougal gave her first television interview about the affair she alleges she had with Donald J. Trump more than a decade ago, saying that he offered her money after their first sexual encounter.“After we had been intimate, he, he tried to pay me — and I actually didn’t know how to take that,” she told Anderson Cooper of CNN in an interview broadcast on Thursday night. “I looked at him and said, ‘That’s not me, I’m not that kind of girl.’”As a security aide of Mr. Trump’s drove her home, she said, “I started crying, I was really sad — it really hurt me.”But, she said, in spite of that encounter in 2006, “I went back,” conducting what she described as a 10-month, serious relationship that she finally ended when she could no longer bear the guilt of betraying Mr. Trump’s then-new wife, Melania.Pressed by Mr. Cooper on what she would say to Mrs. Trump now, Ms. McDougal looked directly into the camera, tearing up, and said, “What can you say except, ‘I’m sorry — I’m sorry.’”Ms. McDougal’s interview made for a jarring, split-screen news night, with the major presidential headlines toggling between the allegations about an extramarital affair from a former Playboy model and Mr. Trump’s decision to remove his national security adviser H. R. McMaster and replace him with John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations.The interview came despite an agreement Ms. McDougal struck during the 2016 presidential campaign with American Media Inc., which owns The National Enquirer, to sell it the exclusive rights to her story about Mr. Trump in a $150,000 deal — part of what is known as a “catch and kill” agreement in which a tabloid buys a story only to bury it. Mr. Trump is a friend of A.M.I.’s chairman, David J. Pecker.Ms. McDougal filed suit earlier this week to get out of her deal with American Media, saying she signed it under pressure and false pretenses, effectively silencing her on the affair. (American Media has denied her claims, saying over the past couple of days that the contract is valid, it was not trying to silence her, and indicating the story “may be published” just yet). Many of the details Ms. McDougal shared in her interview with Mr. Cooper were included in a piece in The New Yorker magazine last month, based on handwritten notes she took about the relationship.But an in-person, television interview is uniquely visceral, and Ms. McDougal’s appearance was clearly of a sort Mr. Trump’s allies would have wanted to avoid during the campaign. On Sunday, “60 Minutes’’ is planning to show an interview by Mr. Cooper with another woman who is suing to get out of a deal restricting her from speaking about an alleged affair with Mr. Trump, the adult entertainment star Stephanie Clifford. Mr. Trump’s representatives have denied that he had an affair with either of the two women.Composed, unwavering, yet sometimes tearful, Ms. McDougal told a detailed story about a relationship that was based on love — “he always told me he loved me,” she said — and was facilitated by one of Mr. Trump’s bodyguards.She described herself as a Republican and said she voted for Mr. Trump in November, describing him as “brilliant” and “charming” and someone she loved enough to even consider marrying. She said she was now eager to tell her story because it was already known and she wanted the chance to tell it herself.Ms. McDougal said she first met Mr. Trump when he filmed an episode of “Celebrity Apprentice” at the Playboy Mansion in 2006, where they struck up conversation and he asked for her number.She said they had their first date that June, on Mr. Trump’s birthday, at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Mr. Trump invited her for dinner, she said, so she was surprised when they entered the grounds from a rear entrance and went directly to a private bungalow. “We’re talking about his birthday, and then as the night ended, we were intimate,” she said.What followed, she said, were dozens of dates and sexual encounters in which, she said in answer to a specific question from Mr. Cooper, Mr. Trump did not use birth control.Many of those encounters, she said, took place at the Beverly Hills Hotel, but she also spent time with Mr. Trump at his other properties across the country. “I went to his golf course in California,” she said. “I went to his golf course home in New Jersey. I went to his home in New York.” At one party, she met his son Eric, and posed with him in a picture, she said. At another, at the Playboy Mansion, she posed for a picture with Mr. Trump, Melania Trump, Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka and other people, keeping her distance from Mrs. Trump as best she could, she said.Ms. McDougal said Mr. Trump had compared her, favorably, to his daughter. “He said I was beautiful like her and, ‘You’re a smart girl,’” she said.Once, she said, she was even whisked to his apartment at Trump Tower, when Mrs. Trump and Barron were not home.“I said, ‘Aren’t you afraid to bring me here?’ He’s like, ‘They won’t say anything,’” she said. While he gave her a tour, she said, “we passed a room and he said this is Melania’s room she likes to have her alone time.” But, she said, being in the apartment, “just puts a little stab in your heart,” and she could not wait to leave.An unbearably guilty conscience prompted her to finally end the relationship in 2007.Ms. McDougal said she was “disgusted” by the hot-mic “Access Hollywood” tape recording that came out late in the presidential campaign in which Mr. Trump bragged about grabbing women by the genitals, just as she was “mortified” when more than a dozen women leveled sexual misconduct allegations at him. “I’ve never seen that side of him,” she said.Asked about denials Mr. Trump’s representatives have issued about her allegations of an affair, Ms. McDougal said, “I think somebody’s lying, and I can tell you it’s not me.”
         Correction: March 23, 2018  An earlier version of this article, using a preliminary transcript, misquoted part of a comment by Karen McDougal. She said that after she had been intimate with Donald Trump for the first time, “he tried to pay me; and actually I didn’t know how to take that.” She did not say, “I actually did not take that.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/us/politics/john-bolton-national-security-adv.html","President Trump said on Thursday that he had picked John R. Bolton, a Fox News analyst and a former ambassador to the United Nations, as his next national security adviser, choosing a longtime brash, conservative hawk to help shape his foreign policy operation.Mr. Bolton, 69, has been in the public eye, and in Washington, for 30 years. Outspoken and never one to back down from a debate, he served in the administrations of the past three Republican presidents, mostly in the State Department, and has elevated his profile in recent years. Some of his views were once seen as out of the political mainstream — his harsh criticism of the United Nations, for example — but his blunt, in-your-face approach now resembles that of Mr. Trump.Over the years, Mr. Bolton’s uncompromising views on foreign policy have both raised concerns and grabbed headlines. Here are some examples.‘The End of North Korea’Mr. Bolton, who is scheduled to start at the White House on April 9, will take over as a top adviser to Mr. Trump during a critical time. Mr. Trump recently accepted an invitation from North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, to meet for negotiations over its nuclear program. That meeting is expected to take place sometime within the next month and a half.While the person Mr. Bolton is replacing, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, has advocated preventive war with North Korea if nuclear diplomacy fails, Mr. Bolton has long taken an even harder line toward the country. In 2003, when he was an under secretary in the State Department under President George W. Bush, Mr. Bolton criticized North Korea’s leader at the time, Kim Jong-il, as a “tyrannical dictator” over a country where “life is a hellish nightmare.”His brash comments complicated the Bush administration’s dealings with North Korea, which fired back with its own criticism of Mr. Bolton, calling him “a human scum and bloodsucker.” That same year, Mr. Bolton said that after the Iraq war, which he also advocated, the United States would go after Iran, Syria and North Korea.In an interview with The New York Times in 2002, Mr. Bolton was asked about the Bush administration’s stance on North Korea. He grabbed a nearby book and placed it on the table. The title: “The End of North Korea.”“That,” he said, “is our policy.”His view has not changed. Last month, he pondered an American military strike against North Korea in a Wall Street Journal column titled “The Legal Case for Striking North Korea First.”Like Mr. Trump, he has been dismissive of the United Nations.In 1994, Mr. Bolton remarked about the United Nations’ headquarters: “The Secretariat building in New York has 38 stories. If it lost 10 stories, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference.” In that same speech, he said, “There’s no such thing as the United Nations.” At that time, Mr. Bolton had just left his position as an assistant secretary of state after Bill Clinton became president.His dismissive views of the United Nations, along with his hawkish ideology, led to a five-month showdown in 2005 between the Bush White House and Senate Democrats when President Bush nominated him as ambassador to the United Nations. The president ultimately bypassed the Senate and appointed Mr. Bolton as ambassador in August 2005 through a backdoor procedure known as a recess appointment.Asked by senators in 2005 about his harsh speech about the United Nations in 1994, Mr. Bolton shrugged off his criticism, saying that he was just trying to get the audience’s attention. “The comment about the 10 stories was a way of saying there’s not a bureaucracy in the world that can’t be made leaner and more efficient,” Mr. Bolton told senators.Mr. Bolton resigned as the United Nations ambassador in December 2006, around when his recess appointment was set to expire and as it was clear he would not win Senate confirmation.He believes the Iran nuclear deal is a ‘massive strategic blunder.’The appointment of Mr. Bolton as national security adviser will place two of the most outspoken critics of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal around Mr. Trump. Both Mr. Bolton and Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director who was recently nominated as the next secretary of state, oppose the deal, which was made under President Barack Obama.Last October, Mr. Bolton wrote in The Hill that he believed senior advisers were giving “flawed advice” to Mr. Trump to preserve the deal. He warned, “Obama’s Iran nuclear deal is poised to become the Trump-Obama deal.”

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/24/596529415/the-russia-investigations-d-c-races-to-secure-future-elections-is-it-enough","This week in the Russia investigations: Washington turns its focus to election security. Will it be enough? The Russia imbroglio is so vast that only parts of it come into focus at one time.One day: social media agitation. Next day: potential collusion.But one of the biggest, least appreciated and potentially most important threads in the story hasn't gotten as much focus: securing future elections from more active measures. Until now.This week, the floodgates opened. The House and Senate intelligence committees both issued recommendations for securing the 2018 races and beyond.Then Congress offered hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of new funding for election security, both for states and specifically to help the FBI fight cyberattacks.How much difference will it all make? Will it be enough?One question too early to answer is how soon the money would begin flowing, and how quickly states could then use grants or other support from the federal government to begin upgrading their systems. There may not be enough time to make much of a difference in this year's races.Over the longer term, though, many states may buy new voting equipment.Five states use computer voting systems that leaves no paper trail and nine others use combinations of digital and paper ballots that also don't leave a paper record. One priority about which there was consensus this week was the importance of paper ballots and physical accounting that takes vote tallying out of the potential realm of electronic sabotage.Although officials say cyberattacks didn't change any vote tallies in 2016, that is a theoretical danger with any computerized system.Much of what state-level elections officials do, however, will remain networked, including working with registrations and local coordinators. So even paper-voting states require better defenses against cyberattacks like those that targeted state systems and their vendors two years ago.The Department of Homeland Security says Russian hackers probed 21 states in 2016. Attackers only got into one — Illinois — according to DHS, and did not alter any of the data it contained.Everyone is unhappy with the way things went in 2016. It took DHS nearly a year to notify states and the public about what it and the intelligence community knew about the cyberattacks. That enraged state officials and irked members of Congress.Another lesson from this week was how difficult those relationships remain as the technical nature of the threat stays well ahead of America's 18th century institutions.Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen told senators things are getting better. She also acknowledged there are many roadblocks still to navigate.For example, Nielsen told senators that the basis by which DHS deals with states in terms of discussing cyberthreats or compromises is entirely voluntarily. That means she doesn't want to announce findings publicly or even necessarily brief the congressional oversight committees.""What we find is when we notify others of who the victims are, unfortunately it has a chilling effect and we no longer get the information from those who have been attacked,"" she said.States not only don't want to be embarrassed, they want voters to vote.So if they, or DHS, or the intelligence community got into the business of talking more openly about cyberthreats or cyber-preparedness, that would not only be politically bad, it would further erode confidence in democracy — which is one of the objectives of foreign attackers in the first place.Press reports and public hearings, however, are some of the best ways to compel action from often close-mouthed government officials. This dilemma won't go away.Compounding the problem, as NPR's Miles Parks reported, is that states aren't equal in their importance to elections, especially on a national level. States that could swing in decisive ways, as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan swung in 2016, are facing many more attacks than states that tend to remain solidly red or blue.The enemy gets a voteRussia's campaign of active measures that peaked in 2016 has never stopped, as top intelligence and national security officials warn. That also means that Americans are keyed into it in ways they weren't then — so if part of what made it effective was its novelty, that is dulled this time around.Many more voters will be on guard for 2018 and 2020, the thinking goes.At the same time, foreign powers aren't standing still either. Another important question about Washington's new consensus on election security is whether the United States is enlisting a horse-drawn army to fight a mechanized opponent.One example is what's been described as a new wave of digitally altered video, which could make it appear as though public officials or others had said things on TV they haven't actually said.What if it begins appearing seamlessly in social media platforms that rely on video — or want to increase their reliance on it?Another example: custom malware that might cause chaos on Election Day in key places. One top House intelligence committee member, Rep. Mike Conaway, R-Texas, said a ""cyber-bomb"" might scramble all the voter registration information for a key polling place at an important moment.Election officials and voters would need to improvise, raising questions about whatever workarounds were put in place to placate the lines of people waiting to vote — perhaps leading them to go home without casting a ballot.And none of this means, however, that the 2016 playbook wouldn't also work again. Facebook and Twitter remain susceptible to manipulation. The emails of political organizations or elected officials remain vulnerable to being captured and released in order to embarrass them.Members of Congress this week urged DHS to work quicker to attribute cyberattacks and make the information public.Still, no matter how quickly the government confirmed that, for example, a politician's tranche of emails had been stolen and aired as part of an active measures operation, it couldn't stop the press from covering what they contained. The government couldn't stop the subject from being changed in the middle of a campaign or make what had become public information private again.Diagnosis confirmed. Prognosis uncertain.Although House intelligence committee Republicans have given Trump a clean bill of health over whether his campaign conspired with the active measures, the imbroglio wore on. The Senate committee and Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller continue their work.Meanwhile, America's body politic has received a chronic diagnosis.Elections are going to continue to suffer from interference as they have for decades but at greater levels of intensity than ever, national security officials warn.Although Washington continued with preparations this week to manage this condition, it still isn't clear whether many Americans have accepted it."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/23/596401989/trump-threatens-veto-of-spending-deal","Updated at 2:21 p.m. ETPresident Trump signed a massive spending bill Friday, hours after threatening a veto that would have triggered a government shutdown.The $1.3 trillion omnibus legislation passed both chambers of Congress after lengthy negotiations between leaders of both parties. The Senate passed it late Thursday, and most lawmakers had left Washington by Friday morning.Trump tweeted just before 9 a.m. ET that he was ""considering a VETO"" because the bill does not fully address his immigration priorities. Hours later, the president relented and signed the measure, just as his aides had promised all along.The eleventh-hour veto threat added suspense to what otherwise would have been a perfunctory signing ceremony and guaranteed a rapt audience for the president's midday TV appearance.""I looked very seriously at the veto,"" Trump said. ""I was thinking about doing the veto. But because of the incredible gains that we've been able to make for the military, that overrode any of our thinking.""Aides had been insisting Trump would sign the measure because it authorizes tens of billions of dollars in additional military spending.""My highest duty is to keep America safe,"" Trump said.The president complained that he was forced to go along with higher spending on domestic programs in order to win Democratic support for the bill but insisted he would not do so in the future.""I say to Congress I will never sign another bill like this again,"" Trump said.He urged lawmakers to grant him authority to veto individual line items in future spending bills. He also called for scrapping the requirement of 60 votes to pass a bill in the Senate — a threshold that demands bipartisan compromise. Neither of those moves appears likely. The Supreme Court ruled the line-item veto unconstitutional 20 years ago. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has rejected the idea of discarding the filibuster.A day earlier, Vice President Pence told an audience in New Hampshire that one reason Trump would sign the omnibus was because it included some money for a border wall.""With $1.6 billion included in the spending bill that arrives on President Trump's desk tomorrow, we're going to start to build that wall,"" Pence said to applause. ""We're doing it.""White House budget director Mick Mulvaney also cited the bill's increases in spending on the opioid crisis, school safety and workforce development.""Is it perfect?"" Mulvaney asked, rhetorically. ""No. Is it exactly what we asked for in the budget? No. Were we ever going to get that? No. That's not how the process works.""Mulvaney acknowledged the bill does not go as far as Trump wanted on immigration.""Let's make it clear,"" Mulvaney said. ""The president wanted a DACA fix as part of this deal. He had offered a large package with a complete DACA fix in exchange for the entire wall. ""There is more to the story, though: In exchange for a DACA fix — to protect young immigrants brought to the country as children from deportation — Trump demanded not only funding for the border wall but also big changes in the nation's legal immigration system.Trump has rejected proposed bipartisan DACA fixes that would swap a permanent fix for money to build a border wall. The White House demanded broader changes to legal immigration that Democrats wouldn't support.Conservatives in Congress opposed the spending bill because it would add to the deficit. Many, like House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., say they were dismayed that the legislation includes spending increases sought by Democrats and fails to fulfill Republican campaign promises to cut the overall size of government.Republican leaders could have crafted a spending bill that met conservative demands, but it would fail in the Senate, where Democrats have enough votes to block legislation.The omnibus spending package has been in the works for several months and was crafted with input from both the White House and Congress. It was written to fill out a budget outline that Congress passed, and Trump signed, in February.McConnell, R-Ky., said Thursday that the spending legislation was a true compromise.""Months of in-depth, bicameral, bipartisan negotiations and committee work have led up to this point,"" McConnell said. ""The result is legislation that neither side sees as perfect — but which contains a host of significant victories and important achievements on behalf of the American people.""NPR's Scott Detrow and Kelsey Snell contributed to this report."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/23/596044821/russia-hacked-u-s-power-grid-so-what-will-the-trump-administration-do-about-it","When President Trump phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin to congratulate him on his re-election Wednesday, Trump made no mention of one of the latest irritants between Russia and the West — his administration's announcement that Russia successfully hacked the U.S. power grid.The Department of Homeland Security and the FBI issued a joint alert last week: ""Russian government cyber actors"" have been targeting U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including energy, nuclear and commercial facilities, since at least March 2016.The announcement came the same day that the U.S. imposed sanctions against 19 Russian individuals and five entities for interfering in the 2016 election and for other cyber-intrusions.James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert and vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the news that Russia penetrated the energy grid does not exactly come as a surprise.""The Russians have been doing this for years,"" Lewis said. ""The change is that the U.S. government came out and said the Russians hacked the utilities.""The government informed electric companies last summer that Russia undertook what DHS calls a ""multistage intrusion campaign"" against the utilities, using common hacking techniques such as malware and spear-phishing. The hackers were able to to gain access to at least one power plant's control system.""They were not simply looking around that system and reconnoitering it,"" Joel Brenner, head of counterintelligence under the Director of National Intelligence in the Obama administration, told NPR. ""They were placing the tools that they would have to place in order to turn off the power. That's a serious vulnerability for us, and we're not anywhere near ready to deal with it.""The Russians have targeted other countries' electrical grids, most notably Ukraine in 2015, disrupting power for more than 200,000 people.Scott Aaronson, vice president of security and preparedness at the Edison Electric Institute, which represents the nation's electric companies, said U.S. power companies have tried to learn from that attack.Can Americans feel confident the U.S. grid is protected?""Very much so,"" Aaronson said. ""The electric power sector takes a lot of different measures to protect our systems.""That includes operating power plants without digital controls, just like in the old days, he said.""I tell people one of the best ways to protect against a cyberthreat is to not rely on cyber assets,"" Aaronson said, adding that the U.S. power grid ""operated for the better part of the last century"" without digital controls.He also said utilities can ""go back to a less-efficient means of operating but still keep the lights on.""Some power companies also block emails and other Internet traffic from outside the country.But protecting the grid is complicated because of its decentralized nature, with public utility commissions in 50 states exercising some control.Critics say the Trump administration needs to take stronger steps to block these kinds of attacks from Russia. At a hearing Tuesday, Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., called the DHS alert a siren.""Our energy infrastructure is under attack,"" Cantwell said. ""It's under cyberattack, and we need to do much more to protect it as a national critical asset.""Cantwell wants the Trump administration to do an assessment of Russian cyberattacks against the electric grid. The Department of Energy is establishing an Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, which will focus on energy infrastructure security.But any retaliation in response to Russia's cyber-incursion would be up to Trump.But, as Brenner points out: ""The president has not so far shown any inclination or any backbone in confronting repeated Russian provocations. And one can only ask why that is.""Brenner added that Putin is ""playing jiu-jitsu with us.""""Nobody wants a war,"" he said, adding the hostilities taking place now ""are in the gray space between war and peace.""CSIS' Lewis said that absent a strong U.S. response to the Russian cyber-incursions though, Russia is likely to continue its behavior.""The problem here is if we don't give the Russians the idea that doing something to us is bad, they may be tempted to do it,"" Lewis said.And while sanctions can function as somewhat of a deterrent to further intrusions, they may not be enough."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/23/596108391/female-candidates-breastfeed-children-in-campaign-ads","In recent years, candidates have tried all kinds of strategies to make attention-getting campaign ads. Throwing a large rock into a pond. Assembling a gun blindfolded. Talking to donkeys.In two new political ads, however, candidates try something decidedly more commonplace: breastfeeding their children.One ad opens on Maryland Democratic gubernatorial candidate Krish Vignarajah breastfeeding her baby and talking about the lack of women in state and federal elected office in her state.In the other, Wisconsin Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kelda Roys feeds her infant daughter while talking about how she worked to help Wisconsin ban BPA, a chemical found in plastics, which some scientists have suggested is linked to health problems.Breastfeeding may be as old as humanity, but doing so openly is rare in the world of political campaigns. As more women flood into politics, the videos represent one way that they are increasingly willing to break the mold of the standard candidate, almost entirely shaped by men, and more fully reflect womanhood in their campaigns.The ads come as an unprecedented wave of women, including many young women, are running or preparing to run for Congress and governorships in 2018. Putting one's motherhood front and center could, at first blush, look like a political risk. That's because voters have more doubts about mothers' ability to juggle politics and family than they do about fathers, as a 2016 study found. ""Voters will raise questions about a candidate's role as a mother as part of campaign discussions,"" the study from the Barbara Lee Family Foundation found. ""They recognize a double standard for moms, who will get the most questions, but actively participate in it and are conscious of doing so.""Not that female candidates needed academic research to understand that. Pennsylvania Republican state House candidate Natalie Mihalek recently wrote in an op-ed that she gets questions about child care that her male opponents do not.""Why am I the only candidate in the room being asked these questions?"" she wrote. ""Do they think mothers don't already juggle multiple tasks? Has no one noticed that men, my husband included, are also parents and share parenting duties?""While motherhood complicates a woman's candidacy, it may also be true that the best way for female candidates to deal with a double standard is to confront it head-on, and breastfeeding in a campaign ad is certainly one way for a candidate to show voters that she has no problem being a mom and a politician at the same time.""A prime concern for voters is whether a woman candidate will be able to both serve her constituents and care for family at the same time,"" said Amanda Hunter, communications director at the Barbara Lee Family Foundation. ""And by sort of addressing that out the gate, that can be an effective strategy.""What it means is that these candidates have an additional topic to address, on top of their policy positions and qualifications. While the ads come at a time that it's attention-grabbing to breastfeed in a campaign ad, they play into an existing cultural conversation around ""normalizing"" breastfeeding.It's a conversation that has inched into the political world. A Virginia state representative recently breastfed her daughter on the floor of the House of Delegates. Other politicians — a member of parliament in Iceland and a member of parliament in Australia — have similarly garnered attention for breastfeeding their children while conducting political business, and a D.C. City Council member pumped breast milk during a committee hearing in December.Candidate Roys told NPR that the response to her ad has been ""overwhelmingly positive,"" and that it has additionally helped her gain traction in a crowded Democratic primary field to take on Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican running for a third term. ""It's been phenomenal. It's been absolutely fantastic,"" she said. ""And in a primary where we have a lot of candidates who are older white men — that is really what the field looks like — I stick out in a lot of ways.""NPR's Sarah McCammon contributed to this report.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/03/23/596458498/spending-bill-protects-tipped-workers-from-sharing-with-the-boss","A bipartisan bill Congress passed this week spells out how the federal government will spend $1.3 trillion.It also allocates some smaller amounts: the money customers leave behind as tips in restaurants, nail salons and other businesses.The legislation makes it clear that tips belong to the workers who receive them and can't be taken by their employers, managers or supervisors.""For the millions of workers who rely on their tips to pay their bills and support their families — most of whom are women — this change comes as a sigh of relief,"" says Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who pushed to include the language in the omnibus spending bill.The long-standing policy that tips belong to workers had been called into question by a proposed rule from the Trump administration's Labor Department.The rule was intended to encourage more sharing of tips with cooks and dishwashers. But critics said it would have allowed business owners to pocket the money themselves. When the Labor Department asked for public comment on the proposal, more than 375,000 people responded.""Workers across the country organized and made their voices heard,"" Murray says. ""Those workers sent the Trump administration a message.""Many restaurant servers are already required to share a portion of their tips with hostesses and busboys. But restaurant owners have not been allowed to require such tip pooling with ""back of the house"" workers. Some owners complain that creates an unfair pay gap between tipped workers in the ""front of the house"" and lower-paid workers in the kitchen.""Cooks historically and even today have always received the short end of the stick in terms of the tip world,"" says Kurt Huffman, who runs more than two dozen restaurants in Portland, Ore.Kitchen workers in his restaurants earn starting wages of about $13.50 an hour. With tips, servers can earn two or three times as much.The spending bill passed this week amends the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow mandatory tip sharing with back-of-the-house employees. But it also includes explicit safeguards to prevent employers from skimming tips or using that money to compensate managers and supervisors.""This is a huge victory for tipped workers everywhere,"" says Judi Conti, government affairs director for the National Employment Law Project. ""It makes clear that tips are the property of workers and under no circumstances can employers keep them.""Conti notes the legislation allows for broader tip pools only when all of the workers in the pool are paid at least minimum wage. The measure also adds robust penalties for tip theft and allows workers to sue to recover any tips that are stolen."

""The look on my face must have been so sad,"" she said. She wondered, ""Does he think I'm in this for money? That's not me.""""I'm not that kind of girl,"" she said she told him.His response: ""You're really special.""McDougal recounted the specifics of the alleged affair. She first met Trump at the Playboy Mansion when he was filming an episode of Celebrity Apprentice. He said ""hello"" and seemed immediately smitten by the striking brunette, who bears more than a passing resemblance to his new wife at the time, Melania. He was direct in asking for her number and called ""right away."" Over the next few days, they talked on the phone. She said she had many of Trump's private phone numbers, including those of his bodyguard and his assistant.When asked what attracted her to Trump, she ticked off a list: He is a nice-looking man; he is sweet, funny, very charismatic; and his personality is ""wow!""""Great posture,"" she added.Their first ""date,"" she said gesturing with air quotes, took place at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on June 12, 2006, two days before Trump's 60th birthday. She thought they were meeting for dinner in the tony hotel restaurant, but instead, Trump's bodyguard ushered her into the reality star's usual bungalow.""I was concerned,"" McDougal confided to Cooper and the audience at large. ""At that moment, I realized maybe something else is going on.""After some conversation, they had unprotected sex, she said.According to McDougal, Trump said, ""I don't like these things."" It's unclear whether she meant condoms or another form of contraception.That set a precedent for their future sexual encounters, of which she said there were ""many dozens."" From June 2006 through April 2007, she said, ""We saw each other a minimum of five times a month up to bigger numbers,"" and each meeting involved some type of sexual intimacy.Throughout their relationship, Trump arranged their trysts, asking her to meet him all over the country in private and in public, she said. Mostly he would fly her out to meet him and put her up for the length of her stay, but he occasionally had her book her own travel and pay for herself, with the understanding that he would reimburse her later.That way there would be ""no paper trail,"" she said.She told Cooper that Trump didn't seem to care whether people saw them together and didn't seem conflicted about cheating on his wife. She said she visited him at his New Jersey home. Once, she said, he even took her to the apartment in Trump Tower where he lived with his wife and their young son, Barron.""Aren't you afraid to bring me here?""""They won't say anything,"" Trump supposedly said.He showed her around the ""very gold"" apartment and pointed out Melania's room, saying, ""She likes to get away to read.""It was moments like this, McDougal said, that filled her with guilt and dread over the extramarital affair.""Doing something wrong is bad enough, and when you're doing something wrong and you're in the middle of somebody else's home or bed or whatever, that just puts a little stab in your heart,"" she said.Even worse was actually meeting Melania and posing for a picture with her, Trump and a handful of McDougal's Playboy Playmate colleagues, she said. McDougal conceded it is possible Melania knew about the Playmate's dalliance with Trump.Still, she said she was very happy throughout the romance. She said that she loved Trump and that he loved her. He told her so ""all the time"" and had several pet names for her, including ""baby"" and ""beautiful Karen.""One of her memories involves Trump favorably comparing her to his daughter Ivanka.""He said I was beautiful like her,"" she told Cooper.Throughout the relationship, McDougal kept a journal recording her encounters with Trump. She said her sister and a handful of friends knew of their liaison. But, she told Cooper, she did not keep any texts, photos or messages documenting their relationship.At one point, Trump said he was remodeling an apartment as a Christmas gift for McDougal, she said. But she never saw it.McDougal said she was not aware that Trump allegedly had other paramours while they were involved, including adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who says she also had a fling with Trump. Stormy, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is also suing to be able to tell her story.""I thought I was the only one,"" McDougal said, adding that ""it makes sense. If he's doing it behind his wife's back, why would he not do it behind my back?""In the end, McDougal said, she was overwhelmed by guilt and fear that the affair would become public. That feeling is what ultimately led her to end it, the same way it started, over the phone, she said.""The excitement took over for a while, but I started feeling so bad about myself. ... It was tearing me apart in the long run. I knew I needed to get out,"" she said.McDougal delved into the lawsuit filed in a California court earlier this week that asks for her release from a contract she signed with American Media Inc. for her life rights.Shortly after Trump won the Republican nomination, the model turned aspiring journalist promised to keep quiet about the supposed romance with Trump in exchange for $150,000 and a deal to write articles for some of the company's magazines and appear on at least two covers.She explained to Cooper that she was happy to take the hush money. In fact, she said she was relieved that the story of the illicit affair would be buried and also thrilled about the opportunity to rebrand herself from former Playmate to lifestyle and fitness model.She said AMI and its owner, David Pecker, in particular, framed the deal as a means to ""jump-start"" her career and protect her image as ""wholesome and pure.""At the time, she thought, ""It's a win-win for me. I get the work, and my story doesn't have to come out.""Additionally, she felt a deep sense of loyalty to Trump both as a former lover and as a Republican.""I voted for the president. That's my party. That's my president,"" she said.But things didn't pan out the way she had anticipated. The company and Pecker, who is a longtime friend of Trump's, failed to hold up their end of the bargain, according to McDougal. And now she wants out of the contract.""I almost feel violated. I feel taken advantage of,"" she told Cooper. ""I feel like the contract was illegal, I was lied to, and I want to share my truth.""""I want my life rights back,"" she said.As NPR reported, AMI denies the accusations, and in a statement issued Tuesday, the company said, ""McDougal has been free to respond to press inquiries about her relationship with President Trump since 2016,"" adding that ""the suggestion that AMI 'silenced' her is completely without merit.""Still, McDougal said she fears financial ruin and hopes a legal judgment in her favor will release her from the deal with AMI. She has even offered to pay back the money she took.She also offered an apology to Melania. ""I'm sorry,"" she said choking back tears. ""I wouldn't want it done to me.""""I know it's a wrong thing to do, but in those days, I was a different girl. I had fun. I was in the Playboy scene,"" she explained.In the years since her entanglement with Trump, she has returned to her roots and faith. ""I'm going to church. I'm involved in ministry,"" she said.Trump has not commented on any of McDougal's claims, but the White House has denied the affair.""I think somebody is lying, but I can tell you it's not me,"" she said."

""I don't want to see those restricted for law-abiding citizens.""""March For Our Lives"" was organized by students after the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.

On a Facebook event page, they say they plan to march in front of gun control activists. Some attendees say they will bring their guns.Similar events are also being held in California, Indiana and other states.Chester is a College Republican slated to speak at the pro-gun rights rally in Helena, Mont.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/24/595755604/cant-get-elected-dogcatcher-try-running-in-duxbury-vt","A version of this story was first published by member station Vermont Public Radio.It's a political insult that dates back to the 1800s: ""He couldn't get elected dogcatcher."" President Trump even trotted it out last year to disparage Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., with whom he was feuding at the time.It's supposed to be a joke: an elected dogcatcher, really? But it's no joke in Duxbury, a town in central Vermont, population 1,337 as of the last census. It may be the only jurisdiction in the U.S. with a dogcatcher subject to the will of the voters. During the lunch break of the town's annual meeting earlier this month, residents were lined up in the Crossett Brook Middle School cafeteria for a $5 potluck put on by the town's historical society. Later the residents will vote on a variety of local ordinances and town offices. First in line was a tall red-head man with a graying beard, plaid shirt, wool vest and a camo baseball hat. Everyone here knows his name: Zeb (short for Zebulon) Towne, Duxbury's elected dogcatcher.Towne guesses he's held the post for about 15 years, although he hasn't really kept track. He gets paid $500 a year, mostly to make sure there aren't dogs running loose around town. It's a one-year term, so he gets elected at Duxbury's town meeting each year.""When I first started doing it, I think it was holding up the town meeting because nobody wanted to do it,"" he explains. ""So I said if it will get us along, I'll do it. And, plus, I had a Walker Coon Hound that was always out running. So, I figured, if somebody picked her up they'd have the number to call.""So not exactly a dog-eat-dog election.There was one year though when Towne faced some potential competition:""And I said, 'Good. Go ahead. These are the types of calls you're gonna get,'"" recalled Towne, before explaining the nature of the position, which although it's described as dogcatcher, also includes taking calls ranging from ""there's an ermine in my porch"" to ""there's these beef cows running through the woods."" ""And at the end of it,"" Towne said, no one else ran for the post ""because everybody else said, 'We don't want that.'""But when it comes down to it, Towne really does like the job. ""It's fun, interesting.""Towne guesses he gets 20 to 30 calls a year, and he says about half of them go something like this:""'Well, I'm just calling to let you know.''You don't have to do anything, but I want you to know about it.''So don't write anything up or call anybody, but this is what's going on.'""All joking aside, Towne takes his job seriously.""It's basically...also for the animals,"" he says. ""I have had to go and take some out of homes that were being not treated correctly and been left,"" he admits. ""A few other serious calls were saying, 'dogs were biting multiple people.' You know, that's when ... I get serious on it.""Duxbury resident Phyllis Berry says the town's animals like Towne, too.""All I can say is all my dogs love Zeb,"" she says. ""So, we don't have to look very far if they get loose. They end up at his house anyway.""Of course, a man can't live off a dogcatcher's stipend alone. Towne is something of a jack-of-all-trades who surveys land, does construction and works at Mad River Glen ski area. He also produces maple syrup from his 3,500-tap maple sugar operation.As for that infamous insult, Towne says it doesn't offend him.""No, because I can,"" he says. ""I'm the only person in the country who gets elected as a dogcatcher. So, I'm awesome, I guess."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/22/593283104/trump-national-security-adviser-h-r-mcmaster-to-resign-be-replaced-by-john-bolto","Updated at 8:20 p.m. ETNational security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster is leaving the Trump administration, the president announced on Twitter Thursday evening. ""I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend,"" the president wrote. Trump also said former Ambassador John Bolton will replace McMaster in a change that takes effect April 9.The planned change at the top of the country's national security infrastructure comes after McMaster had an unsettled tenure inside a White House that recently has been expelling its top officials like a deflating balloon.In a separate statement, McMaster said he was requesting retirement from the U.S. Army effective this summer. ""I am thankful to President Donald J. Trump for the opportunity to serve him and our nation as national security advisor,"" McMaster said. ""I am grateful for the friendship and support of the members of the National Security Council who worked together to provide the President with the best options to protect and advance our national interests.""In an additional statement issued by the White House, President Trump said McMaster ""helped develop our America First National Security Strategy, revitalize our alliances in the Middle East, smash ISIS, bring North Korea to the table, and strengthen our nation's prosperity. This work and those achievements will ensure that America builds on its economic and military advantages. I thank General McMaster and his family for their service and wish them the very best.""A White House official said Thursday that Trump and McMaster mutually agreed on the resignation, which the two men have been discussing for some time. The timeline for McMaster's departure was expedited, the official also said, because both men felt it was important to have the new team in place, ""instead of constant speculation.""McMaster's departure ""was not related to any one moment or incident; rather it was the result of ongoing conversations between the two,"" the official also said.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tweeted that McMaster should be ""proud"" of the work he did during his tenure and called him ""one of the great national security minds of our time and a terrific patriot!"" And retiring Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it had ""been a privilege to work with [McMaster] on some of the most pressing issues facing our country.""McMaster was a storied Army field commander who became a well-known skeptic about bureaucratic indecision at the highest levels in Washington, D.C.He enjoyed support from some in top posts, including Defense Secretary James Mattis, when Trump began searching for a replacement for his disgraced first national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn.Flynn was one of Trump's first close political advisers and an early joiner in his upstart political campaign, but he was forced out over his role in the Russia imbroglio. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's then-ambassador to the United States.So Trump, who never served in the military and never held elected office, needed another counselor and, in a relatively rare decision, picked an active-duty Army general in McMaster.McMaster and Trump at first appeared simpatico in broad aspects of their worldview. They wanted a United States that mixed it up with competing world powers, throwing geopolitical elbows to gain advantage in the way they saw other nations throwing theirs.It fell to McMaster, however, to translate Trump's doctrine on Inauguration Day about ""America First"" into one that could comport with the country's many important global alliances.That's what led to the corollary that ""America First"" didn't mean ""America Alone,"" but it did mean that the U.S. wanted to be a contender as much as a leader.""The president embarked on his first foreign trip with a clear-eyed outlook that the world is not a 'global community' but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors, and businesses engage and compete for advantage,"" McMaster wrote with Trump's then-chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn — who has also since stepped down.""We bring to this forum unmatched military, political, economic, cultural, and moral strength. Rather than deny this elemental nature of international affairs, we embrace it,"" the two men also wrote.But if Trump liked that vision, he apparently grew to dislike McMaster.According to inside accounts, the two men clashed when McMaster's cerebral briefings crashed into Trump's more freewheeling style.Trump, meanwhile, was bitterly disappointed with what he considered a lack of meaningful new options from McMaster and the Pentagon on the quagmire in Afghanistan.Rather than turning the conflict around sharply or cutting bait altogether, as Trump had considered, the White House made an open-ended commitment to Afghanistan that simply removed any pretense of an end date from the nation's longest war.Then there were the reports — always sourced on background — that McMaster was among those top advisers privately contemptuous of Trump's fitness for the job. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly called Trump a ""moron"" and lost his job. McMaster reportedly said Trump had ""the intelligence of a kindergartner"" and now has lost his job."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/22/594363877/trump-names-john-bolton-as-national-security-adviser","Updated at 8:08 p.m. ETPresident Trump has chosen John Bolton, a hawk on North Korea and Iran, to be his next national security adviser.The appointment comes just as those two foreign policy challenges come to a head.Bolton replaces H.R. McMaster, who Trump said Thursday via Twitter is leaving the administration. Bolton takes over from McMaster effective April 9, the president also said.In an interview on Fox News, where he had been a contributor, shortly after the news broke, Bolton called his appointment a ""great honor"" but seemed surprised that the Trump administration had announced the appointment so soon. Bolton was spotted earlier Thursday at the White House.""It's always an honor to serve our country, and I think, particularly, in these times, internationally, it's a particular honor,"" Bolton said.But when pressed by host Martha MacCallum about his foreign policy views on a variety of pressing topics, from the Iran nuclear deal to North Korea, Bolton repeatedly deflected.Bolton did say he was ""outraged"" by a leak earlier this week that apparently came from someone at the National Security Council. According to the Washington Post, despite an all-caps warning in Trump's security briefings not to congratulate Russian President Vladimir Putin on his electoral victory last weekend, the president did so anyway.Bolton also argued that Trump's decision to congratulate Putin ""wasn't a significant point one way or the other.""""I've said 'congratulations' to a lot of people — foreign diplomats and officials. It's a matter of being polite,"" Bolton said.Trump has accepted an invitation to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as early as May. He also has to weigh in on the Iran nuclear deal again that month. Bolton has been an advocate for regime change in both countries and, as a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, he wrote that President Trump should ""abrogate the Iran nuclear deal in his first days in office.""Instead, Trump has kept up the U.S. side of the bargain, continuing sanctions relief in exchange for limits on Iran's nuclear program. He is warning he could walk away from it in May unless diplomats fix parts of the deal he doesn't like by then.""No fix will remedy the diplomatic Waterloo Mr. Obama negotiated,"" Bolton wrote in the Wall Street Journal in January. ""Mr. Trump correctly sees Mr. Obama's deal as a massive strategic blunder, but his advisers have inexplicably persuaded him not to withdraw,"" he added.When it comes to his hawkish views on Iran, Bolton is more in line with the newly nominated secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who still has to be confirmed for the job. The national security adviser doesn't need to go through that confirmation process, which may have been difficult for Bolton. He is the third man to hold the job for the Trump administration, following McMaster and before that Michael Flynn.Also on Fox News Thursday, Bolton described the job he was about to undertake as having two primary facets. The first, he said, was that of being an ""honest broker"" to the president — ""making sure that the president has the full range of options presented to him to make the decision that only the president can make,"" which is ""presented in a way that gives the president a chance to weigh the pluses and minuses.""The second part of that job, Bolton said, was to be a conduit between the White House and other agencies and offices tasked with implementing the president's decisions, ""making sure that the bureaucracies out there get the decision and implement it.""Bolton said that hasn't always been a smooth process, but that ""the rest of the bureaucracy needs to understand as well that when the guy that got elected makes a decision, that's what the Constitution provides.""The new national security adviser-designate also said he believed there should be a ""free interchange of ideas among the president's advisers,"" otherwise ""the president is not well-served.""Bolton served as undersecretary of state for arms control and United Nations ambassador during the George W. Bush administration and was an advocate for the Iraq War. He stepped down as ambassador in 2006 after holding the job on a temporary basis and facing a challenging path to confirmation in the Senate.He advocates a sort of ""drain the swamp"" agenda when it comes to international organizations, calling, for instance, to move from ""assessed funding"" to ""voluntary funding"" at the United Nations. He once famously said that if the U.N.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/22/595779345/on-defense-over-russia-trump-could-get-another-boost-from-house-intel-panel","The White House could look for another political booster shot on Thursday if its allies on the House intelligence committee give more detail about how they cleared President Trump's campaign of colluding with Russia's attack on the 2016 presidential election.Intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., is poised to release more details from the classified report in which Republicans conclude there is no evidence Trump or his aides conspired with the wave of Russian ""active measures"" that continue to be directed against the West.Intelligence committee members are scheduled to meet behind closed doors on Thursday to review the final version of the Republicans' report and then set in motion the process by which the intelligence community is likely to declassify it.The committee's GOP majority could release unclassified sections of the document. Nunes has previewed the findings once already and Trump hailed the clean bill of health he got from the panel's Republicans.The president could tout the panel's findings once more on Thursday amid a week that has underscored how difficult it has been for him to shake allegations he may have a secret relationship with powerful Russians or be subject to some kind of clandestine influence.The latest flare-up is over Trump's phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader has begun a new term after an election not considered free or fair. Trump offered Putin ""congratulations"" and did not broach the issue of Russia's interference in U.S. elections or Russia's poisoning attack against two people in the United Kingdom.Trump's advisers recommended that he not congratulate Putin, according to the Washington Post, but he did it anyway. White House officials made clear the leak of that detail enraged Trump and that whoever was responsible could be fired or even prosecuted.Trump's geniality with Putin followed an earlier data point for critics who argue there's something going on behind the scenes.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to fault Russia for what is considered its sham election that reinstalled Putin. Opponents called that a major break with past practices by the United States to advocate for freedom and democracy.""Does the president of the United States even agree with the message that political and economic freedom are things that we are supposed to promote?"" asked Rep. Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee.Other critics went even further. The Russians ""may have something on him personally,"" former CIA Director John Brennan said of Trump on MSNBC.The comments may have been a reference to the thesis of the infamous, unverified dossier about Trump compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele during the 2016 campaign. NPR has not detailed the material in the dossier but generally it describes a concerted effort by Russian leaders and the Trump campaign to align their efforts.The American political research operative who commissioned the dossier, Glenn Simpson, told members of Congress that Steele believed Trump was being blackmailed, which is why Steele sought to give the material in the dossier to the FBI.Republicans point out that Steele and Simpson aren't neutral actors; although Steele couldn't vote in the U.S. election, he told American officials he personally opposed Trump. And Simpson hired Steele and did other work as part of a political operation using Democratic money.The provenance and reliability of the dossier have become one of the hottest points of controversy in the Russia imbroglio.The Democratic minority on the House intelligence committee said in a memo last month the FBI has verified some of the things it contains, but those details are classified.If Republicans release more on Thursday from their report about the attack on the 2016 election, that will give them and the White House another opening to respond and debunk Steele's dossier.More broadly, Trump and Sanders scoff at the accusations about being too close to Putin or the United States generally being soft on Russia.They and other administration officials point out the range of areas in which Washington is trying to check Russia around the world — from the government in Venezuela to the supply of anti-tank weapons to anti-Russian forces in Ukraine.The United States and Russia must talk with each other, as Trump and Putin did, Sanders said — but the president is acting in America's interests.""We're going to continue to do that, while also continuing to be tough on a number of things, including sanctions on Russia, rebuilding our own military, and exporting energy — things that we know are not great for Russia,"" Sanders said.Trump followed up with his own defense of sustaining ties with the Russians.The timing of House intelligence committee Republicans' update on Thursday is important for another reason: Three women are in the headlines this week as they pursue lawsuits related to what they call past sexual contact with Trump, both wanted and unwanted.Two women — pornographic actress Stormy Daniels and onetime Playboy model Karen McDougal — say they had consensual relationships with Trump more than 10 years ago. The third, Summer Zervos, accuses Trump of kissing her and touching her without her consent. Trump denies the allegations.McDougal and Daniels both have TV interviews scheduled over the coming week; McDougal on Thursday evening and Daniels on Sunday.The unverified Steele dossier also contains lascivious allegations about Trump. NPR has not detailed them but they became notorious after BuzzFeed News posted an unexpurgated copy of the dossier online in early 2017.So the degree to which House Republicans' update on Thursday might seek to debunk the salacious Steele allegations could provide new ammunition as the White House defends itself against charges from the three women now in the public eye.The White House has been on offense against the Justice Department and its special counsel, Robert Mueller, since the firing last week of former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.Trump and his allies have pointed to McCabe's dismissal as evidence that what they call ""biased"" investigators and attorneys are conspiring against the president out of partisan animus.That has led to concerns from Democrats that the president and Attorney General Jeff Sessions might make Mueller their next target. Senate intelligence committee ranking member Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., and others want their colleagues in Congress to pass legislation explicitly protecting Mueller.House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., don't agree. Both said on Tuesday all the other goings-on with McCabe and the Justice Department aren't connected to Mueller.They also said they have no doubt that Mueller would be able to stay in his job and accordingly no law is needed to bar Trump from firing the special counsel without cause.""The special counsel should be free to follow through his investigation to its completion without interference, absolutely,"" Ryan said. ""I am confident that he'll be able to do that. I have received assurances that his firing is not even under consideration.""But no handshake agreement between Trump and Republican leaders would stop any attempt by the president to shake up the Justice Department or get rid of Mueller before Congress could respond — for example, with impeachment proceedings. The only recourse would be congressional action afterward.That prompted one of Trump's Republican antagonists, retiring Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, to urge the president not to ""go there."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/22/595897412/john-boltons-curious-appearance-in-a-russian-gun-rights-video","Updated at 6:50 p.m. ET Incoming White House national security adviser John Bolton recorded a video used by the Russian gun rights group The Right to Bear Arms in 2013 to encourage the Russian government to loosen gun laws.The episode, which has not been previously reported, illustrates the common cause that Russian and American gun rights groups were forming in the years leading up to the 2016 election through former National Rifle Association President David Keene. Keene appointed Bolton to the NRA's international affairs subcommittee in 2011.Russian politician Alexander Torshin helped establish The Right to Bear Arms and cultivate ties with American gun rights groups including the NRA. As a Putin ally, Torshin served as the deputy speaker of Russia's parliament for more than a decade and also spent time on Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee, a state body that includes the director of Russia's internal security service.The Bolton video appears to be another plank in a bridge built by Russia to conservative political organizations inside the United States. It's unclear why Russian leaders wanted to curry favor with the NRA, but Torshin and Keene appeared to have developed close ties in the years prior to the 2016 election.It's a relationship that has outsize importance now that the FBI is reportedly investigating whether Torshin illegally funneled money to the NRA to assist the Trump campaign in 2016, as McClatchy reported in January. The NRA has denied wrongdoing.President Trump announced Thursday evening that Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations, would be his pick to replace national security adviser H.R. McMaster and that the transition would happen on April 9. Bolton was spotted at the White House earlier Thursday and also visited Trump in the Oval Office earlier this month.Bolton is a curious pick for The Right to Bear Arms in its video effort to influence the Russian legislature. After all, he is one of the most hawkish, anti-Russia figures in Republican Party foreign policy circles. And yet the video recorded by Bolton was used by this obscure Russian gun rights group with ties to the Kremlin.A source close to Bolton told NPR that he was originally asked to record the video by Keene, who served as NRA president from 2011 to 2013, and that he was informed the recording was for the Russian legislature. The source also said the former ambassador had never heard of The Right to Bear Arms until recent news coverage of the group.Russian gun laws are relatively strict, and there is no fundamental right to own a gun. In the video, Bolton urges the Russian people to adopt gun rights as part of their constitution — in much the same way that the United States has a Second Amendment. At the time, he was a member of the NRA's international affairs subcommittee, a position Keene had appointed him to. The two have known each other since 1972, when Bolton interned for Keene.""Thank you for this opportunity to address the Russian people on the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution,"" Bolton said in the video, which has previously been unreported. ""Were the Russian national government to grant a broader right to bear arms to its people, it would be creating a partnership with its citizens that would better allow for the protection of mothers, children and families without in any way compromising the integrity of the Russian state. That is my wish and my advice to your great people.""Keene is a central player in the links between the American and Russian gun rights movements, and fall 2013 was a key moment in the development of this relationship.A few days before Bolton's video was posted online, in November 2013, Keene was in Moscow for The Right to Bear Arms annual conference, delivering a speech. More than 300 gun rights advocates across the globe gathered in an upscale hotel to hear arguments for loosening of gun rights. There was even a concealed-carry-fashion show.There were signs that the Russian government had given its approval that the conference take place. Russian politicians, such as Torshin, were present, made speeches and were presented with honorary memberships to The Right to Bear Arms.""One would have to make an assumption that in Russia, which is a fairly closed society, that if someone was doing this, the government wasn't upset by it and knew what was going on,"" said conference attendee Alan Gottlieb, the founder of the U.S.-based Second Amendment Foundation. ""The feeling was that it was sanctioned by the powers that be, so to speak. Otherwise, I would have doubted if it were to have taken place.""Gary Burris, another attendee, recalled ""two or three high-ranking government officials there"" who represented the Russian legislature. ""They were people who had some political sway.""Bolton was not present at this conference. But the issue the former ambassador raised in his 2013 video — changing the Russian Constitution to guarantee gun rights — was a major theme.""Amending the Russian Constitution to include a right to keep and bear arms provision, like our Second Amendment, was definitely a high priority for the attendees at the conference,"" Gottlieb told NPR.At the conference, Keene said that it was a ""great honor to be here today, partly because over the course of the last three years, I've hosted your senator Alexander Torshin at the National Rifle Association's annual meetings.""Torshin regularly tweeted and posted photos of his visits with Keene over the years. Keene had once reciprocated and posted a photo of Torshin on his personal website.But with the report of an FBI investigation, as well as a preliminary inquiry into the NRA, times have changed — that photo was removed from Keene's website. However, he did not delete the reference from his Facebook page, where it remains.Neither Torshin nor Keene responded to multiple requests for comment."

But a source familiar with Dowd's thinking says he was tired and frustrated, in a draining job with not enough resources and with a client who was not taking his advice.When reached by phone all Dowd would say is, ""I love the president and wish him well.""Trump's legal team is in the midst of ongoing discussions with Mueller over a possible interview with President Trump. Dowd recently described them as ""productive and constructive."" Speaking at a White House event Thursday after news of the resignation broke, the president told reporters he would like to speak to investigators as part of the Mueller probe.Over the weekend, however, Dowd suggested that the Mueller investigation be shut down. At first, he said he was speaking as the president's counsel; then he walked it back to say he was speaking for himself.""Just end it on the merits in light of recent revelations,"" Dowd said in an email.Those recent revelations?""I pray that Acting Attorney General Rosenstein will follow the brilliant and courageous example of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and bring an end to alleged Russia Collusion investigation manufactured by McCabe's boss James Comey based upon a fraudulent and corrupt Dossier,"" Dowd emailed.Hours later, President Trump began tweeting his own criticisms of the investigation, using Mueller's name for the first time:Dowd's resignation also comes just days after the president added a new lawyer to the team, Joe diGenova, who has been outspoken in his attacks on the Justice Department Russia investigation.""There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and — if she didn't win the election — to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,"" diGenova said on Fox News in January.Dowd was reportedly blindsided by the hire and according to one source expressed concerns to Trump that diGenova had conflicts of interest because his small law firm also represents former Trump campaign advisor Sam Clovis and former Trump legal team spokesman Mark Corallo, both of who have reportedly been interviewed as part of Mueller's investigation.Dowd had only just been brought onto Trump's legal team last June to add some Washington experience to Trump's defense. Here's the thumbnail of Dowd's career we wrote up back then:"
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/22/596158332/another-effort-to-get-rid-of-the-johnson-amendment-fails","A provision in the U.S tax code that bars churches and charities from engaging in political campaigns remains intact, more than a year after President Trump pledged to ""get rid of and totally destroy"" it.Under the Johnson Amendment, named for its 1954 legislative sponsor, then-Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson, religious and nonprofit organizations can lose their tax-exempt status if they engage in activity ""on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.""Some religious leaders and politicians say the amendment limits the right to free speech and have argued for its repeal. Speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast in February 2017, President Trump gave the repeal effort his full support. In May he signed an executive order urging the Treasury Department to show leniency in enforcing the amendment, and in recent months he urged the U.S. Congress to do away with it altogether.The repeal effort, however, ran into stiff opposition from nonprofit organizations and many church groups who said that without the amendment they would face pressure from politicians seeking endorsements. Neither the tax bill passed in December nor the spending bill passed Thursday by the House included a repeal provision.Among those who pushed hard to get rid of the Johnson Amendment were Vice President Pence and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., along with other conservative members of Congress.Scalise's press secretary, Lauren Fine, said the amendment's repeal ""remains a priority"" for the Louisiana congressman but that the provision fell victim this week to the bipartisan negotiation over the spending bill. ""It's unfortunate that this was not one of the things that made it in,"" Fine said.The drive to repeal the amendment was led by conservative activists such as Ralph Reed and Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. and had strong backing from the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal aid organization. Since 2008, the ADF has promoted ""Pulpit Freedom Sundays"" as occasions when pastors should challenge the prohibition against political activity by preaching openly about the moral qualifications of candidates seeking office.The campaign has never gained much momentum, however, perhaps because relatively few pastors appear to feel constrained by the amendment, and because surveys show Americans don't want to hear more politics from the pulpit.Among those celebrating the preservation of the amendment was the National Council of Nonprofits, a network of about 25,000 charitable organizations around the country, and more than 100 religious groups.""Those who depend on houses of worship and community nonprofits can breathe a sigh of relief,"" said Amanda Tyler, executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. ""Concerted efforts to weaken the long-standing law that keeps [them] free from partisan campaigning were rebuked yet again."" Another repeal effort could come during consideration of the FY 2019 appropriations bill in a few months."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/22/596058282/president-trump-orders-50-billion-tariffs-on-china","Updated at 1:45 a.m. ET on FridayIn a major escalation of the president's ""America First"" trade policy, the Trump administration is preparing to impose stiff tariffs on Chinese imports. The goal is to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China by $50 billion. President Trump is also calling for new limits on Chinese investment in U.S. technology, in an effort to protect what the administration calls America's ""economic seed corn.""The Chinese government responded with a list of retaliatory tariffs it would impose on about $3 billion dollars worth of U.S. exports, according to Reuters.The U.S. stock market dropped sharply in anticipation of possible fallout from the trade moves. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 700 points.Although the president late Thursday signed a temporary exemption from higher steel tariffs on six countries and the European Union until May 1, as discussions continue, China remains squarely in Washington's crosshairs. Argentina, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, Canada and Mexico will get the temporarily exemption.  The tariffs on China are a response to longstanding complaints that Beijing  unfairly requires U.S. companies to share their technology as a cost of doing business in that country. The administration is also concerned that China is strategically acquiring innovative technologies through investments in the United States.""Our view is that we have a very serious problem of losing our intellectual property, which is really the biggest single advantage of the American economy in my opinion,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said this week.Aides described the $50 billion figure as a conservative estimate of what forced technology transfer and other moves by China cost the U.S. economy. The president suggested the total value of the tariffs could go as high as $60 billion.Trump signed a presidential memorandum Thursday directing his trade representative to draw up a long list of Chinese products to which the tariffs would be applied. The list will be made public in 15 days, and the tariffs would take effect after a period of public comment.Business leaders acknowledge that China's treatment of intellectual property is a problem, but they warn that tariffs could backfire. Dozens of trade groups sent a letter to the president on Sunday urging Trump to pursue a different course.""The imposition of sweeping tariffs would trigger a chain reaction of negative consequences for the U.S. economy, provoking retaliation; stifling U.S. agriculture, goods and services exports; and raising costs for businesses and consumers,"" said the letter, signed by leaders of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation and other groups.Lighthizer acknowledged those concerns during testimony this week before the House Ways and Means Committee.""Nobody wins from a trade war,"" he said. ""We certainly don't want a trade war. On the other hand, you have to ask yourself, can we go on with a $800 — and growing — billion trade deficit. There's only a handful of countries in the whole world that have a GDP the size of that. So we have to do something.""The United States had a $337 billion trade deficit with China last year, 9 percent larger than the year before. When Trump talks about the trade gap, he often excludes services, where the U.S. has a surplus. The U.S. trade deficit with China in goods alone was $375 billion last year, an 8 percent increase from 2016.The proposed tariffs on imports from China follow the administration's decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Those tariffs, which take effect on Friday, have already been watered down. Lighthizer said that in addition to Canada and Mexico, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea and the European Union will be exempted from the steel and aluminum tariffs, at least temporarily.Administration officials defended the crackdown on China, saying years of dialogue during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations had not produced the desired change. Dialogue continued during the opening months of the Trump administration, but the president has now decided tougher action is required.China was quick to express its disappointment with Trump's move, calling it a ""typical unilateral trade protectionist action.""""China does not want a trade war with anyone. But China is not afraid of and will not recoil from a trade war,"" said a statement issued by the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. ""If a trade war were initiated by the U.S., China would fight to the end to defend its own legitimate interests with all necessary measures.""The move could complicate Trump's effort to cultivate China's help in addressing North Korea's nuclear program.Critics also warned that unilateral action by the United States squanders an opportunity to put international pressure on China for practices that are widely criticized by other countries.""America first does not mean America alone,"" said Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis. ""By isolating us and by demonizing many of our friends and allies with a broad scope of retaliatory action, I think makes our trade agenda that much more complicated.""But White House trade adviser Peter Navarro defended the president's move.""This is a historic event,"" Navarro told reporters Thursday. ""President Trump should be applauded for his courage and vision on this."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/22/595770479/unlike-much-of-the-rest-of-washington-the-supreme-court-is-no-snowflake","The streets in Washington, D.C., were barely covered with snow Wednesday morning.Eventually, some 3 to 5 inches accumulated. But D.C. isn't particularly known for handling inclement weather very well. It's essentially a Southern town when it comes to weather.Most folks huddled at home, with the federal government shut down — except for essential workers. The schools announced a day early that they would shutter their doors, too.But there was at least one place where the work went on, and it always does — the U.S. Supreme Court.At the highest court in America, it was just another day at work.The justices announced opinions, heard arguments and the chamber was packed with lawyers and interested observers.(Across the street, Congress was in session, but that's probably because most members live close by; the Easter recess starts next week; and votes on bills had already been scheduled for Wednesday. Lawmakers are also set to unveil a spending deal to avoid a shutdown at the end of the week.)Snow way they're missing a day in court — a legacy of William RehnquistAt the Supreme Court, snow is simply not considered an excuse for failure to function. Most old-timers give the credit (or blame) for that to the late Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.Rehnquist, who grew up in snowy Wisconsin, viewed Washington's fear of falling snow as totally ridiculous. Even in near-blizzard conditions, if necessary, he would send out court SUVs to pick up the justices and other court personnel to ensure that there was no interruption in the schedule.And woe be to the lawyer scheduled to argue a case who thought he or she could easily beg off on grounds of difficult transport.Indeed, on one or more occasions, attorneys drove through blizzard conditions from cities hundreds of miles away in order to be at the lectern when their case was called for argument.Snow games and misdirectionIn Rehnquist's eyes, snow was an occasion not for anxiety, but for games, and perhaps misdirection. One year, on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Rehnquist and Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. were spotted on the court plaza during an anti-Roe demonstration nearby.The Washington Post reported that the two justices were spotted watching the marchers.In fact, they were doing nothing of the sort.Rather, they were watching two of their law clerks measuring the snow. One clerk was to measure; the other was to verify the measurement. The outcome would settle a bet.As it happens, the current chief justice, John G. Roberts, clerked for Rehnquist, and he has followed his onetime boss's show-must-go-on policy for the most part.But then, he's from Indiana, another snowy state.So, on Wednesday morning, promptly at 10 a.m. ET, the justices were on the bench, first issuing opinions, then hearing cases argued.Justice Samuel Alito announced the first opinion. A 9-0 decision overturning a decision in a death-penalty case. The court said a federal appeals court in Texas wrongly denied funds requested by a defense lawyer for ""investigative, expert, and other services reasonably necessary"" for the representation of the accused.Justice Stephen Breyer announced the second decision, a tax ruling with potentially broad implications. By a 7-to-2 vote, the court made it harder for the federal government to prosecute someone for obstructing an IRS investigation.It was nothing a little snow was going to stop."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/03/22/595648318/poll-most-u-s-teachers-want-gun-control-not-guns-to-carry","Nearly three-fourths of U.S. teachers do not want to carry guns in school, and they overwhelmingly favor gun control measures over security steps meant to ""harden"" schools, according to a new Gallup poll.The nationally representative poll of nearly 500 K-12 teachers was conducted earlier this month, after the Parkland, Fla., shooting and student protests brought national attention to the issue of gun violence.Some of the poll was released last week. In that portion, 73 percent of teachers opposed training teachers and staff to carry guns in school. Of those, 63 percent ""strongly"" opposed the proposal. In addition, 7 in 10 teachers said arming teachers would not be effective in limiting casualties in a school shooting.In the part of the poll released Thursday, teachers were asked in an open-ended question to name one thing that could be done to prevent U.S. school shootings. One-third named gun control or stricter gun laws, the most popular response. The second leading response, with 22 percent, was bans on specific guns. One in 5 suggested enhanced mental health services, and 15 percent favored ""better school security."" Just 7 percent mentioned arming teachers.In a separate question, just 1 in 5 teachers agreed that arming teachers and staff members would make schools safer. At the same time, 22 percent said it would make schools about as safe as they are now, while 58 percent said it would make schools less safe.When asked which specific measures would be ""most effective"" at preventing school shootings, 57 percent favored universal background checks, and the same number, 57 percent, also favored banning the sale of semiautomatic weapons such as the one used in the Parkland attack.The pollsters noted that the partisan leanings of teachers may influence their beliefs about gun safety. Teachers as a group are twice as likely to identify as, or lean, Democratic rather than Republican.For teachers, school shootings are also a workplace safety issue. About 60 percent of teachers describe their schools as ""very"" or ""somewhat"" prepared and protected. As one indicator of preparedness, the National Center for Education Statistics reports that more than 9 in 10 public schools now conduct active shooter drills.And, despite the intense media coverage, a majority of teachers, 64 percent, said in the Gallup poll that they are ""not too worried"" or ""not worried at all"" about being the victim of a school shooting, and 55 percent said their students felt the same way.Perhaps that's because school shootings, even in the broadest sense of the term, remain relatively rare:The National Center for Education Statistics counts 98,271 public schools and 33,619 private schools in the U.S., in the most recent year these numbers were available. An analysis conducted by The Washington Post found 193 schools where a weapon was fired during school hours in the past 20 years. "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/21/595790359/is-hiding-income-and-destroying-records-obstruction-maybe-not","In a case with potentially broad implication, the U.S. Supreme Court has made it harder for the federal government to prosecute people for obstructing IRS enforcement of the tax code.Federal prosecutors have for decades used a broadly written provision of the tax code to prosecute a wide variety of offenders, from those involved in major financial scams to more mundane criminals who hide their profits from tax collectors.The provision makes it a felony to ""corruptly...endeavor to obstruct or impede the due administration"" of the tax code.But the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that this assertion is not enough. Rather, the government must prove that the defendant was aware of a pending tax-related inquiry, like an investigation or audit, or that he could reasonably have foreseen one.Knowledge of the investigationThe decision was a victory, at least for now, for Carl Marinello, who owned and operated a freight service business in Buffalo, N.Y. By his own account, he did not maintain business records or file corporate or personal income tax returns from 1992 to 2010. Nor did he issue paperwork necessary for his employees to file their returns. He paid his employees in cash and routinely diverted corporate funds for his personal use.In 2004, the IRS, acting on an anonymous tip, opened a preliminary tax evasion investigation, but it closed the probe a year later, because it couldn't determine whether any unreported income was significant. Marinello did not know about the investigation.In 2005, Marinello's lawyer and an accountant advised him that his tax activity, including his systematic destruction of business records, was illegal. But Marinello continued his course of action.In 2009, the IRS reopened its investigation, and interviewed Marinello. At the time, he claimed that he failed to file tax returns between 2005 and 2008, because he made less than $1,000 a year.He eventually admitted that he knew he was supposed to file tax returns and pay taxes, but ""never got around to it."" He also admitted he had diverted money from the business to pay personal expenses, and that he had systematically destroyed his business records, ""because it was the easy way out.""He was subsequently charged with eight tax code misdemeanors involving failure to file returns, and one felony count of obstruction.At trial, the judge instructed the jury that to find Marinello guilty of obstruction, it had to find that he had ""corruptly"" sought to gain financially by committing one of the eight misdemeanor charges — failing to file, hiding income, destroying records, etc. But the judge refused to instruct the jury that it had to find that Marinello knew he was under investigation and corruptly intended to interfere with that investigation.Fair warning for ""the common world""On Wednesday, the Supreme Court ruled that some knowledge of a pending investigation or likely investigation, is required in order to convict. It vacated Marinello's conviction and sent the case back to the lower courts, where it is possible he could be retried.Writing for the court, Justice Breyer said that knowledge of an investigation or likely investigation ensures that individuals will have ""fair warning"" in words ""the common world will understand,"" of what the law is if a ""certain line"" is crossed.Without that limitation, he said the broadly written tax code provision on obstruction ""risks transforming"" misdemeanors into felonies.Imagine, he said, that you are a passenger in a taxi or a customer in a restaurant, and the driver or the waiter asks you to pay the fare or leave a tip in cash. You might reasonably suspect that the driver or the waiter does not intend to report the cash as income.A broad reading of the obstruction clause could expose you to prosecution for obstruction if you paid in cash. ""So could paying a babysitter $41 per week in cash for a year without withholding taxes,"" but, Breyer said, if Congress really expected such dire consequences, it would have more clearly said so.Justices Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, dissented. Writing for the two, Thomas said that Congress had written a broad statute, and that it is not for the court to rewrite it more narrowly. Indeed, he said, the court majority, ""in its effort to exclude hypotheticals, has constructed an opening"" in the obstruction clause of the tax code so large that ""even the worst offenders can escape liability.""Just how broad the impact will be is unclear.Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Schwartz, currently partner at Boies, Schiller & Flexner, prosecuted charges against the ""Madoff Five,"" including tax charges, that are similar to those in the Marinello case. The High Court's decision, he said, will at minimum force federal prosecutors ""to rethink"" the way they try these cases. And it may force the government ""to leave some charges on the table.""Harry Sandick, another former federal prosecutor now in private practice, observed that the court decision ""specifically mentions a memorandum by the Jeff Sessions Department of Justice calling for the prosecution of defendants for the most punitive count available for specific conduct, so it might be the case that the Court is beginning to react to how it fears the department will operate under the Trump administration."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/21/595512197/congress-unveils-1-3-trillion-spending-bill-as-friday-deadline-looms","Updated at 12:55 a.m. ET FridayThe Senate voted early Friday to pass a roughly $1.3 trillion spending bill to fund the government through Sept. 3. The move avoided a government shutdown.The massive spending package easily passed in both the House and the Senate. The Senate vote was 65-32. The House approved it hours earlier 256-167. President Trump is expected to sign the measure.The Senate's vote wrapped up what may be the last major legislative achievement ahead of the midterm elections in November. But the 2,232-page spending bill remained mired in controversy after leaders rushed the measure through rounds of speedy votes.The massive spending measure includes significant boosts to U.S. military spending supported by the president and congressional Republicans, while Democrats secured boosts to domestic spending that most Republicans oppose.Congressional leaders celebrated the legislation publicly while they worked behind the scenes to persuade skeptics to back the legislation. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., joined other Republicans in highlighting the military spending increases.""With the biggest increase in defense funding in 15 years,"" Ryan said in a statement Wednesday. ""This critical legislation begins to reverse the damage of the last decade and allows us to create a 21st-century fighting force.""He is working to tamp down anger among conservatives over spending increases as well as changes to gun policy. Among their chief concerns, the legislation would usher in a period of trillion-dollar deficits at a time when Republicans have complete control of the federal government.Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus said Wednesday that they plan to oppose the bill over those concerns.""That is not in any way close what the election was about, close to what we campaigned on,"" said Ohio Republican Jim Jordan. ""Not close to what we told the American people we were going to accomplish if they gave us the privilege to serve and be in power.""Democrats are facing a separate set of frustrations from the left flank of their party. Many immigration advocates are angry that the legislation includes $1.6 billion in border security money without corresponding protections for immigrants currently protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Program.Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., focused instead on spending increases for domestic programs.""Every bill takes compromise, and there was plenty here, but at the end of the day, we Democrats feel very good because so many of our priorities for the middle class were included,"" Schumer said. ""From opioid funding to rural broadband, and from student loans to child care, this bill puts workers and families first.""The agreement is loaded with dozens of unrelated policies, known as ""riders,"" ranging from gun control to election security aimed at wooing skeptical lawmakers to back the deal.Adding riders is a common — if sometimes controversial — practice used by both parties and the president to jockey for their priorities because they are guaranteed to become law on a must-pass spending bill.The fight over border security and immigration became a major drag on negotiations in recent weeks with both sides refusing to negotiate.The White House initially wanted $25 billion, but Democrats pushed for a far smaller amount with explicit restrictions on how the money could be spent.The final $1.6 billion agreement would fund new fencing along roughly 30 miles of the border that was authorized under an earlier bill. Negotiators also reached a deal to repair existing fencing while explicitly protecting the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge in Texas.The bill also includes nearly $700 million for election security, including additional money for the FBI to conduct counter-intelligence to fight Russian cyberattacks. States would benefit from an infusion of money for election technology grants to keep elections systems safe.Negotiators included several bipartisan items, like $2.8 billion to battle opioid addiction as well as major funding increases for the Department of Veterans Affairs, federal highway projects and high-speed broadband development.But what isn't included is nearly as significant as what made it in the bill.The spending measure is widely expected to be one of the last must-pass bills to come up for a vote this year, meaning immigration has few opportunities for consideration in the coming months.Looming midterm election and the reality that the political season will soon overtake any ability to advance any major legislation before Election Day.Democrats remain frustrated that the bill does not deal with immigration. Many immigration advocates worry that DACA cannot pass if it is not included in a broader bipartisan bill.Republicans also struck down a push to include subsidy payments that would help shore up the individual market places under the Affordable Care Act and partially subsidize premiums for some low-income workers."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/21/595702178/mississippi-is-sending-its-first-woman-to-congress-heres-when-your-state-did-tha","On Wednesday, Mississippi became the 49th state to choose its first woman to send to Congress.The appointment of Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith as Mississippi's junior senator comes 101 years after the first woman, Montana Rep. Jeannette Rankin, went to Congress. Republican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed Hyde-Smith to fill the seat being vacated by Sen. Thad Cochran, who announced that he would resign as of April 1 due to poor health. Hyde-Smith, currently the state's commissioner of agriculture and commerce, will officially take over the seat on April 2, setting a new record of 23 women in the Senate. That will leave just one state — Vermont — that has never sent a woman to Capitol Hill.The chart below shows the years in which each state sent its first woman to Congress. Having sent a woman early to Congress doesn't necessarily mean a state continued a pattern of electing women. While Montana sent the first woman, Rankin, to Congress in 1917 — and again in 1941 — it has not elected any other women to Congress since. Importantly, this history does not show when voters in each state elected their first woman to Congress.Indeed, with Hyde-Smith's appointment, Mississippi continues a nearly century-long pattern. In many states, the first woman sent to Congress was appointed or elected in a special election for a seat vacated by a man (often, this was the woman's deceased husband).In fact, it was just 40 years ago, in 1978, that the first woman was elected to the Senate without having previously finished someone else's term, according to the Rutgers Center for American Women and Politics.Hyde-Smith won't serve long as an appointed senator; she will have a special election in November to serve out the rest of Cochran's term. Her campaign already sent emails touting support from many of the state's GOP leaders and outlining how she has supported President Trump's agenda. Were Hyde-Smith to win in November, she would then have to run again in 2020 for a full six-year term."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/20/595338116/what-did-cambridge-analytica-do-during-the-2016-election","It has been a bad week for Cambridge Analytica.Multiple state attorneys general are launching investigations in the U.S. into the company's misuse of 50 million Facebook users' personal data. The company has been suspended from Facebook in the wake of a New York Times report revealing that it violated Facebook's terms of service for using personal data. And, following a series of undercover sting reports capturing CEO Alexander Nix making outlandish claims about the company bribing politicians or entrapping them by ""sending some girls to the candidate's house,"" Cambridge Analytica's board has suspended Nix from the company.It's all a far cry from the beginning of the 2016 presidential campaign, when Cambridge Analytica waded into American politics with the goal of giving conservatives big data tools to compete with Democrats. Its big promise: developing detailed psychological profiles of every American voter, so that campaigns could tailor their pitches from person to person.""We've been appealing to the same demographic on the same issue,"" Nix told NPR in February 2016, ""yet how we nuance this engagement is completely different.""No, Cambridge Analytica couldn't fully capture the personality of every single voter. But here's how Nix pitched the company's approach at the time. Cambridge Analytica worked with researchers to develop ""a 120-question survey that seeks to probe personality,"" he said. ""And we've rolled this out to literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people across America.""The company asked all sorts of questions about personality and behavior. Then it scored people on traits like openness, extroversion and agreeableness — aspects of the typical ""big five"" personality traits.Personality profilesThose results were mixed together with polls, voter records and online activity in order to create personality models for voters. Cambridge Analytica may not have talked to you, Nix said, but ""if I talk to enough people who look like you, in terms of what data they have, I'd be able to quantify your personality based on the discussion I've had with other people.""This week, the Times reported that Cambridge Analytica collected a lot of this information by breaking Facebook's rules. An outside researcher affiliated with Cambridge University, Aleksandr Kogan, developed an app for the company that required users to sign in using their Facebook accounts.Facebook's rules at the time allowed the app to suck up information about all those users and, even more importantly, information about their friends. That data included education, location, the groups and pages they liked, their relationship status, and where they worked.Kogan, who created the app, was allowed to collect all this information for academic purposes. What he wasn't allowed to do was pass the data along to a third party, instead of using it for research, as had been promised.Facebook has now suspended Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform.Cruz campaign embraces Cambridge AnalyticaAll this data went into the company's much-hyped psychological profiles. While Cambridge Analytica is now associated with Donald Trump's general election campaign, it was Texas Sen. Ted Cruz who first employed the firm.The Cruz campaign went all-in on political science theory and big data approaches to campaigning, and divided voters into six different psychological profiles during the early primaries. The campaign reached out to voters it grouped as ""timid traditionalists"" with different messaging than it did for ""temperamental"" voters, even if the calls, emails, and flyers were about the same Cruz stances on the same topics.The psychological profiling got a lot of media attention after Cruz won the Iowa caucuses, especially after Nix publically claimed credit for the win in a series of media interviews.But as the campaign advanced, the Cruz campaign became skeptical of the approach. It ultimately phased out the psychological profiling attempts after the South Carolina primary, even though Cambridge Analytica staffers remained attached to Cruz's campaign.""In explicit contractual language, Cambridge Analytica affirmatively represented that all data used by them were obtained legally, that they would conduct their operations 'in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations,' and that they 'hold all necessary permits, licenses and consents to conduct its operations,' "" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said in an emailed statement this week.Cruz ended his campaign for president after the Indiana primary. With Cruz out of the race and Trump on his way to lead the Republican ticket, Cambridge Analytica began working for the GOP nominee. This shift paralleled the migration of the Mercer family, major Republican donors with a significant financial stake in the company.While Cruz's campaign had embraced data science and was willing to experiment with political science theories that had never before been tested on the presidential level, the Trump campaign's data operation had been nonexistent. Shortly after winning the Republican nomination, Trump told the AP he viewed data as ""overrated"" in politics.Still, Cambridge Analytica staffers embedded with Trump digital strategist Brad Parscale in his San Antonio office, and played a key role in the campaign's online efforts.""We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign, and our data informed all the strategy,"" Nix unwittingly told Britain's Channel 4 in their undercover sting.But, according to a source close to that operation, psychological profiling never entered into the picture. Given Trump's lack of digital infrastructure, the Cambridge Analytica staffers focused on much more basic goals, like increasing online fundraising, reaching out to undecided voters, and boosting Election Day turnout.People involved in both the Cruz and Trump campaigns say they never used the data Cambridge Analytica illicitly acquired from Facebook. And both campaigns ultimately soured on both the company and its CEO.Nix repeatedly claimed credit for both Cruz and Trump's triumphs, violating long-held norms for behind-the-scenes campaign operatives.Nix continues to brag about Cambridge Analytica's efforts. It's just that, in the most recent episode, he didn't realize he was doing so on camera."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/21/595736996/seize-this-moment-doug-jones-tackles-gun-control-in-first-senate-speech","Alabama Sen. Doug Jones delivered his maiden speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday, tackling a topic that would seem anathema to most Southern Democrats — gun control. Jones, who was elected in a special election upset last December, called for universal background checks, raising the age for purchasing semi-automatic weapons to 21 and eliminating key loopholes that could allow a gun to fall into dangerous hands. ""In the wake of yet another mass shooting, and the rising voices of young people across the country, it is our responsibility – our duty – to have a serious discussion about guns and gun safety,"" Jones said. ""But that conversation has to be two-fold: We must acknowledge the deadly consequences that can follow when a gun is in the wrong hands, but also recognize and respect the freedom to own and enjoy guns by law-abiding citizens as guaranteed by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. Those two concepts are not mutually exclusive."" Jones nodded to his own background as a gun-owning hunting enthusiast, and talked about how he's shared that love with his son. He also shied away from completely vilifying the National Rifle Association, which has resisted many of the proposals he and other legislators have put forward. President Trump initially seemed open to more drastic gun control measures in a bipartisan meeting earlier this month, but later backed off and has endorsed arming some school personnel, among other measures backed by the NRA. But, Jones argued, ultimately the government's commitment to the safety of its citizens must be paramount. And while he said that some of the actions undertaken recently are positive — moving to ban bump stocks that can convert guns into automatic-style weapons, efforts to strengthen the background check system — Jones also said it's not enough. He proposed making background checks universal, including on internet sales, at gun shows and even private sales, as well as implementing three-day waiting periods. ""So while I know that guns and gun control are difficult issues for this country, I can tell you they're complicated for me, too. But as a United States Senator today, a member of the legislative branch of government, I have many obligations. And I believe that the first obligation of government is to protect its citizens,"" Jones said. ""We spend unimaginable amounts of money fighting our enemies abroad and terrorists who would attack us at home. Yet, on many levels, we fail our children and grandchildren every morning when we pack their backpacks and send them into harm's way.""Jones said that, for him, the deadly shooting last month at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 people was a ""tipping point regarding gun violence."" That's spurred a school walkout last week and a protest, ""March For Our Lives,"" this coming Saturday in Washington, D.C., and around the country. A former federal prosecutor, Jones also said the activism spurred by this protest shooting reminded him of the civil rights movement and made him reflect on one his most famous case — finally bringing to justice Ku Klux Klansmen who had bombed a Birmingham church in 1963 that killed four African-American girls. ""With the convictions of two former Klansmen for the murder of those four young girls, that longed-for tidal wave of justice rose up, and hope and history rhymed in Birmingham,"" Jones recalled. ""And for me, and I hope for you, when I walk the halls of the Senate office buildings, and come through those double doors onto the Senate floor, I realize that every day we as a collective body have that same opportunity.  Whether it is for DREAMers, or voting rights, or victims of sex trafficking, or in this case, our children who are demanding action on gun violence, we have the opportunity to build that tidal wave of justice and have hope and history rhyme.""But, Jones said, in order to do so it requires ""courage to seize this moment,"" to work across the aisle and find common ground, tamp down on divisive political rhetoric and be unafraid to do the right thing, no matter the political consequences — something that rings especially true for Jones, as he faces re-election in 2020 in a deep red state. ""We could spend days in this chamber debating the meaning and intent of the Second Amendment.  We can let our nation further divide itself while more lives are lost. We can fret about what people are saying about us on social media or whether we might lose campaign contributions. We can again choose the path of inaction, in the face of yet another mass shooting, and expect different results,"" Jones said.""Or, we can take another path,"" the Alabama senator continued. ""Let us find what we can agree on, act on it, and begin to make our country a safer place.  We can be reasonable here because we all want the same thing: a safer country, a safer world. At its core, the Second Amendment was an effort to protect Americans.  Let us do the same.""""I don't have all the answers on how to do it, but I'm willing to work with each and every one of you to find them,"" Jones closed by promising. ""Because that's why we were sent here – to find those answers...so that the tidal wave of justice will rise up."""

""And so this stuff infiltrates the online community, but with no branding, so it's unattributable, untrackable.""To help disseminate that information, the managing director of CA Political, Mark Turnbull, describes using ""proxies,"" such as charity and activist groups. ""[We] use them — feed them the material and they do the work.""As we reported Tuesday, Nix has been suspended from the company following the broadcast of the first part of the Channel 4 report in which he is heard describing political dirty tricks used to compromise and undermine targeted politicians on behalf of their clients.In the latest report, executives said the data analytics firm's efforts had managed to get Trump elected by just 40,000 votes in three states, despite having lost the popular vote by more than 3 million votes.Cambridge Analytica's chief data scientist, Alexander Tayler, who has been tapped as interim CEO following Nix's suspension, says ""sometimes you have to separate"" Cambridge Analytica's spending ""from the political campaign itself.""""So, in America you know there are independent expenditure groups running behind the campaign ... superPACs, political action committees,"" he explains. ""So, campaigns are normally subject to limits about how much money they can raise. Whereas outside groups can raise an unlimited amount.""""So, the campaign will use their finite resources for things like persuasion and mobilization and then they leave the 'air war,' they call it, like the negative attack ads to other affiliated groups,"" Tayler says.If Tayler's comments are meant to suggest coordination between those PACs and the campaigns, it is illegal under U.S. election law.Politico on Tuesday quotes an unnamed Trump campaign official saying that the 2020 campaign has no contracts with Cambridge Analytica and no plans to use the firm. The official said the firm only ""provided limited staffing"" during the 2016 campaign and that none of the company's data was used.Cambridge Analytica, which was founded by former White House adviser Steve Bannon and deep-pocketed Republican donor Robert Mercer, charges that the Channel 4 reports are misleading and deceptively edited.In a broadside of tweets on Tuesday, the company listed a number of ""myths"" about the use of social media data and its dissemination of ""fake news.""Meanwhile, Facebook has been under continuing pressure to explain how the accounts of some 50 million of its users were mined for data used allegedly to microtarget campaign messages.In a company statement on Tuesday, Facebook said it was ""working around the clock"" to get all the facts and take appropriate measures going forward.""The entire company is outraged we were deceived,"" the statement continued. ""We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people's information and will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/21/595305722/senators-hold-election-security-hearing-after-releasing-recommendations-for-2018","Updated at 5:57 p.m. ETSwing states, and even individual precincts within those states, present a significant point of vulnerability when it comes to the threat of election interference because of their potential to impact the result in a presidential race, the current secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and one of her key predecessors both told senators Wednesday.Both officials appeared before the Senate intelligence committee to discuss election security, as Congress appeared ready to inject approximately $687 million into helping states improve their voting systems and granting additional funding to the FBI.The decentralized nature of elections in the U.S. is often talked about as a strength. Because states run their own elections, it's impossible to break into one system and affect nationwide vote tallies or voter registrations.But that decentralization also means local jurisdictions in places that can have an outsized effect on the outcome of national races — like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan — will be forced to defend against cyber-threats posed by entire nation-state adversaries like Russia.""The reality is: Given our Electoral College and our current politics, national elections are decided in this country in a few precincts, in a few key swing states,"" former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, who served under President Obama during the 2016 presidential election cycle, told members of the Senate intelligence committee. ""The outcome, therefore, may dance on the head of a pin.""The current secretary of DHS, Kirstjen Nielsen, echoed those comments. Johnson and Nielsen testified together, in a show of bipartisanship, on Capitol Hill as part of the Senate intelligence committee hearing.Decentralization ""makes it difficult to have a nationwide effect [with election interference] but also makes it perhaps of greater threat at a local level,"" Nielsen said. ""If it's a swing state or swing area, that can, in turn, have a national effect.""Indeed, an indictment of 13 Russian individuals and three Russian entities filed last month by Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller alleged that the Russian social media disinformation campaign sought to target ""purple states.""Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also touched on the idea.During his line of questioning for Nielsen and Johnson, Rubio painted a harrowing hypothetical picture of a foreign leader who wants to ""create chaos"" in American democracy by spreading misinformation online, then hacking into voter registration data in ""strategically located counties or states"" to change voters' polling places and maybe delete some info from the voter rolls, which, in turn, sows public doubt and uncertainty about the validity of election results, causing mass protests and a lack of clarity over who wins a presidential election in the hypothetical.""Come January, we don't even know if we can swear in a president; the military doesn't know who the commander in chief is. We're in an all-out constitutional crisis,"" Rubio said. ""That sounds like something from a novel, or a dramatic presentation in the movies. How far-fetched is this given the capabilities of foreign adversaries?""Both Nielsen and Johnson agreed the hypothetical threat posited by Rubio was real.Wednesday's Senate intelligence committee hearing came a day after the panel released a list of recommendations to enhance election security, including improving communication between the Department of Homeland Security and state officials, ""rapidly"" replacing aging voting machines across the country and passing legislation in Congress to get states more money to improve cybersecurity.That last recommendation looks to be getting some help as part of the congressional omnibus spending bill, which faces a Friday deadline for passage to avoid another temporary lapse in appropriations for the government. According to a source familiar with negotiations, Congress is set to approve $380 million for election technology grants that states can apply for to improve their voting systems, and another $307 million to help the FBI fight Russian cyberattacks. The funding development follows on the heels of the top Democrats on Capitol Hill asking last month for a boost in funding for the FBI and DHS in the midterms season.While it's unclear where the election technology grant money will be allocated, Larry Norden, an elections expert at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York, told NPR last summer that it would cost about that much money — a maximum of $400 million — to replace electronic voting machines in more than a dozen states that have no paper backup systems. Replacing those machines has long been a priority for cybersecurity experts who warn that they could theoretically be hacked without detection.Wednesday's hearing was the latest chapter in the committee's ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Russian operatives targeted the voting systems of at least 21 states leading up to Election Day in 2016, according to DHS, and were able to successfully hack into at least one. There is no evidence, however, that any vote tallies were changed.But DHS was slow in relaying all that information to the state and local election officials who needed it. It took the department almost a year after the 2016 election to notify the correct parties, a delay senators voiced frustration with on Wednesday, as local officials say they needed threat information as soon as possible to prepare for this year's midterm elections.""The threat of interference remains, and we recognize that the 2018 midterm and future elections are clearly potential targets of Russian hacking attempts,"" said Secretary Nielsen. ""To be clear, there has been a learning curve on the sharing of information.""Since that information sharing snafu, DHS has gone out of its way to try to bring state and local officials into the fold. The department began the process to get ""secret"" security clearances for three officials in every state, so the officials can view classified information, although, upon questioning by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Nielsen said only about 20 officials of the eligible 150 have received such clearances so far.But, Nielsen added that if DHS is aware of a threat it needs a local jurisdiction to know about, it will offer officials from that jurisdiction a one-day clearance to be able to receive the relevant information. DHS offered a one-day clearance briefing last month, however, and many officials came away feeling less than satisfied with that briefing's depth.The hearing spoke to the often tense and under-defined relationship between the federal government and the states when it comes to improving election security. States report security breaches to the federal government voluntarily, so DHS says it can't share that information with the public, or even with lawmakers, if it wants to encourage those states to continue sharing which, in turn, allows DHS to continue to help defend against threats and intrusions.""Americans don't expect states, much less county officials, to fight America's wars,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. ""The Russians have attacked our election infrastructure. Leaving our defense to states and local entities in my view is not an adequate response.""NPR Congressional Reporter Kelsey Snell contributed to this report."

Certain nations want to disrupt.""“So think of aircraft carriers, planes, tanks, ships, all of those things are part of the national security systems that we worry about,” she said. “We provide codes, keys, crypto.

NSA is an organization that has people that are experts in these fields.""With an ever-evolving threat, the work demands a team in place to anticipate and confront the myriad challenges. Bailey emphasized that a new integrated cyber center is being built on the agency’s west campus, where “we're bringing together our partners across the government like DHS, FBI and DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency].”“We're bringing together our top allies that we partner with to sit in there so we're all seeing this data in real time and we have very robust information sharing,"" she said."

David Eastburn, a Pentagon spokesman, said the announcement of a new policy would have no immediate practical effect on the military because the Pentagon is obliged to continue to recruit and retain transgender people in accordance with current law.“After comprehensive study and analysis, the Secretary of Defense concluded that new policies should be adopted regarding individuals with gender dysphoria that are consistent with military effectiveness and lethality, budgetary constraints, and applicable law,"" the statement reads. ""The Department of Justice will continue to defend DOD’s lawful authority to create and implement personnel policies they have determined are necessary to best defend our nation.""Consistent with this new policy, we are asking the courts to lift all related preliminary injunctions in order to ensure the safety and security of the American people and the best fighting force in the world.”The Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBT civil rights organization, accused the Trump administration of pushing ""anti-transgender prejudices onto the military.""""There is simply no way to spin it, the Trump-Pence Administration is going all in on its discriminatory, unconstitutional and despicable ban on transgender troops,"" said HRC President Chad Griffin.The Democratic National Committee released a statement signed by Chairman Tom Perez, DNC LGBT Caucus Chair Earl Fowlkes, and DNC Treasurer Bill Derrough, whom the DNC says was prevented from serving in the military because he is openly gay.“This decision is an insult to our brave transgender service members and all who wear our nation’s uniform,"" the statement reads. ""Instead of fulfilling his oath to protect the American people, Donald Trump and Mike Pence are putting our nation’s security at risk and shoving real American patriots back in the closet.""Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in February sent Trump a memorandum laying out policies that ""in the exercise of his independent judgment"" should be implemented by the Defense Department. The memo reads, in part:“Based on the work of the Panel and the Department’s best military judgement, the Department of Defense concludes that there are substantial risks associated with allowing the accession and retention of individuals with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria and require, or have already undertaken, a course of treatment to change their gender.""Furthermore, the Department also finds that exempting such persons from well-established mental health, physical health, and sex-based standards, which apply to all Service members, including transgender Service members without gender dysphoria, could undermine readiness, disrupt unit cohesion, and impose an unreasonable burden of the military that is mot conductive to military effectiveness and lethality.""In July, Trump tweeted that the federal government ""will not accept or allow transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military"" - reversing a 2016 policy under President Barack Obama. The move caught the Pentagon by surprise.""Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail,"" the president said at the time.Trump's push for the ban has been blocked by several legal challenges and the Pentagon began allowing transgender recruits to seek enlistment in January.A 2016 study by the Rand Corp. estimated that nearly 4,000 transgender troops were on active duty and in the reserves, Politico reported. But LGBT advocacy groups in the military put the figure at around 15,000, the report said.Fox News' Lucas Tomlinson, Lukas Mikelionis and the Associated Press contributed to this report."

On Friday, 23 British diplomats were expelled from Moscow in retaliation.“The United States stands firmly with the United Kingdom in condemning Russia’s outrageous action,” White House spokesman Raj Shah said Saturday. “The president is always considering options to hold Russia accountable in response to its malign activities.”“The United States is considering a range of options to respond to Russia’s outrageous actions in the U.K., both to demonstrate our solidarity with our ally and to hold Russia accountable for its clear breach of international norms and agreements,” said Nauert.The White House’s National Security Council has reportedly advised Trump to expel Russian diplomats. Trump critics have repeatedly said the president is too supportive of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s leadership style.Trump earlier this week congratulated Putin on his successful reelection, despite purportedly being advised not to make the call. The federal government is also investigating whether the 2016 Trump presidential campaign colluded with Russia.Previously, Trump joined May and the leaders of France and Germany in condemning the attack.""It is an assault on U.K. sovereignty and any such use by a State party is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and a breach of international law. It threatens the security of us all,” they said in a rare joint statement.The quartet wrote “there is no plausible alternative explanation” except Russian responsibility for the attack on British soil, and the Kremlin’s failure to respond to a “legitimate request” for an explanation “further underlines its responsibility.”“We call on Russia to live up to its responsibilities as a member of the UN Security Council to uphold international peace and security,” the statement said.Russia has fiercely denied any involvement in the poisoning, saying that it had destroyed its chemical weapons and had no motive to kill Skripal, who was convicted of spying for Britain but released in a 2010 spy swap.Fox News’ Rich Edson, Lucia Suarez and John Roberts and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

He also sent along three gifts: a sword and scabbard, a photograph of the king with one of his daughters, and an impressive pair of elephant tusks.He addressed the letters to then-President James Buchanan ""or whomever would become president"" with elaborate paragraph-long salutations.The offer of elephants did not neglect practical details. Mongkut stated, ""On this account, we desire to procure and send elephants to be let loose to increase and multiply in the continent of America."" But Thailand — then called Siam — did not have a large enough vessel to transport them, the letter said.It continued: ""In reference to this opinion of ours if the President of the United States and Congress who conjointly with him rule the country see fit to approve, let them provide a large vessel loaded with hay and other food suitable for elephants on the voyage, with tanks holding a sufficiency of fresh water, and arranged with stalls so that the elephants can both stand and lie down in the ship — and send it to receive them. We on our part will procure young male and female elephants and forward them one or two pairs at a time.""Mongkut then in his letter directs that the elephants should be kept away from the cold and under the sun, and to also ""let them with all haste be turned out to run wild in some jungle suitable for them not confining them any length of time.""""If these means can be done we trust that the elephants will propagate their species hereafter in the continent of America,"" the letter said.Thai monarchy expert Tongthong Chandransu said the offer of elephants reveals that Mongkut wanted to be part of building the young United States.""You have to consider that 200 years ago, elephants were an important means of transportation and helped a lot with our work, not to mention warfare, but also the building of homes and cities,"" Tongthong said.The ever-practical Lincoln rejected the offer to send wild elephants running through American forests, saying the country ""does not reach a latitude so low as to favor the multiplication of the elephant.""

It was incredible to see firsthand how high school juniors and seniors are solving real-world challenges while learning how to code, program robots, develop electrical and plumbing systems, and pioneer innovations in bioscience.The students who attend the Waukee Innovation and Learning Center enter the workforce equipped with the skills they need to secure good-paying jobs and succeed in our modern economy.Skill-based education is crucial to putting more Americans on a path to promising careers – and filling the jobs of the future, as well as those that are vacant today. Yet for too long, we have failed to recognize the importance of practical, skill-based learning.In addition to the many administrative actions we have taken to advance workforce development, the president’s recent infrastructure proposal, sent to Congress last month, would greatly amplify and expand this effort.Currently, there are 6.3 million unfilled job openings in our country – the highest number on record. Of these, 250,000 are in construction; 427,000 in manufacturing; and more than 500,000 in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math). These are among the most critical industries in rebuilding our country’s crumbling infrastructure.Our infrastructure plan calls on Congress to refine and reauthorize the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act; expand Pell Grant eligibility to high-quality, short-term programs; and reform licensing requirements for individuals seeking an infrastructure project job.Further, our plan seeks to improve the Federal Work-Study Program by better distributing funds to the schools and students who need them most, and by creating more opportunities for participants to obtain relevant workplace experience that will place them on a better path to meet their career goals.The talent, grit and spirit of the American worker have always defined our nation and enabled us to compete and lead in the global economy.With the goal of growing the American economy through pro-business policies and job creation, the Trump administration’s robust plan aims to deliver education to Americans across the country that is better skills-focused and often debt-free.Now Congress must follow through and invest in our nation’s most important resource: our people."

Some 500,000 people were expected to attend.While the activists “support the right of law-abiding Americans to keep and bear arms, as set forth in the United States Constitution,” they also have a list of demands, urging members of Congress to pass laws to end the sale of high-capacity magazines, improve background checks, and more safety measures.Some of the teenagers have pulled all-nighters organizing the event that will come together Saturday. Celebrities such as Ariana Grande, Jennifer Hudson, George Clooney, Miley Cyrus, and Demi Lovato are expected to march alongside students in Washington. Cyrus, Grande, Hudson, Lovato, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Ben Platt were also expected to perform.‘MARCH FOR OUR LIVES’ GUN CONTROL RALLY TO DRAW THOUSANDS ACROSS US: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOWThe Washington Post reported protesters started filing into Washington, D.C., this week and held tailgate parties, concerts, dinners and sign-making events on Friday. The New England Patriots lent its team plane to Parkland students to travel to the city for the march. The team’s owner, Robert Kraft, contacted the school offering the use of the plane. Delta Air Lines also donated two planes to the students to ensure safe and fast travel.However, some people feel left out from the march or believe the rally will not do much to change what is already in place.Kyle Kashuv, a junior at Stoneman Douglas, has been a prominent advocate for preventing violence while respecting gun rights following the shooting. He has visited the White House, met with President Trump and legislative leaders across party lines, and unveiled an app to prevent school shootings. He slammed Time magazine for not including supporters of the Second Amendment on the cover of their Parkland issue.Zion Kelly, 17, whose brother, Zaire, died during an armed robbery last year told The Washington Post the students from Parkland appear to be getting media attention because of the school they attend is in a predominantly white, affluent community.“This is happening over and over again. Dozens of students have been shot and killed — more than in Florida — and we’re not getting the same attention,” Kelly said. He attends Thurgood Marshall Academy, a charter school in Washington, D.C.“Daily Wire” editor Ben Shapiro told Fox News he has been contacted by students who are conflicted because they support both the Second Amendment and the school shooting victims.Shapiro said the media is “celebrating the marches, putting students in photo ops, or using as political human shields.”WATCH THE MARCH FOR OUR LIVES LIVE STREAM HEREHowever, the organizers of the march claim it is not political.The White House told Fox News in a statement: ""We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today.

The president announced he will replaced National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster with former Ambassador and Fox News contributor John Bolton – a move loved by conservatives and despised by the media.The New York Times called Bolton, “an Undiplomatic Voice for American Might” and mockingly said he “Joins the Trump Cast.” HuffPost called him “As Dangerous As You Remembered.” Far left Splinter News actually headlined: “Trump Hires Bush Administration Demon John Bolton as New National Security Advisor.”The devil you say.There was so much use of the word “hawk” that the news started to sound like the Discovery channel. Or perhaps a conference of birdwatchers.MSNBC’s Chris Matthews’ comments were for the birds, calling Bolton the “biggest hawk there's ever been.” Matthews found almost no end to his lofty hyperbole. “He wants war with Iraq. He pushed and pushed and pushed and wanted to go to war with Syria. Name a country in the Middle East he didn't want to go to war with,” he whined.2. Trump’s Forbidden Words: President Trump congratulated Russian President Vladimir Putin for his victory in the sham elections held in his country. The result sent the news media into a tizzy.NBC reporter Peter Alexander clearly didn’t like it. “The president congratulating Vladimir Putin on his re-election, despite specific warnings from his national security advisers not to,” he told the “Today” audience.MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow described the leak of that congratulations call as a sign of a “national security problem.”Of course, NBC was the only one of the big three networks to mention a huge point – that President Obama had done the same thing, congratulating Putin in 2012. Even left-wing Snopes agreed that it was true. So it’s OK when President Obama congratulates the leader of Russia, but bad when President Trump takes the identical action.3. It’s Spring, Time to Bash Trump: Trump Hunting Season seems to never end. In just one week, the media compared President Trump’s actions to interning Japanese-Americans in World War II and to the death of a young woman in a car driven by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy.Then there’s the new movie about Kennedy’s accident titled simply “Chappaquiddick.” In theory, it’s about how Kennedy’s actions resulted in the death of Mary Jo Kopechne. At the Post, talk of that scandal leads us to … “what resonance does this movie have for a Trump presidency and the current political climate?” Because everything in the Post ties back to Trump.4. Just Beat It! President Trump and presidential wannabe Joe Biden traded insults and physical threats this week in what the Washington Post described as a “Septuagenarian smackdown.” Of course, some in the media were siding with the contender.“The View,” fresh off of Joy Behar’s apology for attacking Christians, now wants someone to assault the president. Co-host Sunny Hostin asked a bizarre question on Thursday: “Why hasn't anybody taken (Trump) out back and kicked his little butt?” The lone conservative on the show, Meghan McCain, called the question “not reality.”In one of the strangest hot takes of the week, Kurt Bardella wrote an opinion piece for NBC saying: “Trump and Joe Biden's Twitter feud proves how threatened Trump is by men who can cry.” Bardella has gone from a right-wing worldview to concocting clickbait opinion that bashes conservatives. Still, this is odd even for him.To his credit, TheRoot.com Politics Editor Jason Johnson said of Biden’s threat to Trump, “that’s not the kind of public discourse that we want anymore from anybody who ever might run for office again.”5. Bunnies and Trolls: The left will attack anyone tied to President Trump, even Vice President’s Mike Pence’s daughter. Comedian John Oliver tried to make a mockery out of her and her dad in a bunny book battle, but she had the last laugh.The New York Times described the younger Pence’s book “‘Marlon Bundo’s Day in the Life of the Vice President”’ as “a picture book written by Mr. Pence’s daughter Charlotte that focuses on the bunny’s observations of the vice president, with illustrations by his wife, Karen.”Oliver decided to make fun of Charlotte’s book with a children’s book of his own – about two gay bunnies tormented by an evil stink bug, drawn as a bug-like Mike Pence.Of course, the media loved Oliver’s book. And they were all set to belittle Charlotte as well. Only she caught them off guard by admitting she had bought Oliver’s book, too. Why? Because, “his book is contributing to charities that I think we can all get behind.”Suddenly, The Daily Beast declared: “Charlotte Pence Is Surprisingly Cool With John Oliver Trolling Her Bunny Book.” Vanity Fair said, “Mike Pence’s Daughters Seem Cool.”Cool enough to even beat John Oliver at his own game.6. Americans Are Sick of Politics: The media are obsessed with politics – jamming it into to everything from an NFL game to nightly sitcoms. Turns out, Americans don’t agree.According to new a poll from a McLaughlin & Associates/Media Research Center, 75 percent of likely voters say they watch entertainment and sports to get away from politics. But politics keep intruding. Just this week, The Sporting News was highlighting an interview that compared college basketball to “slavery.”The poll results are telling; 44 percent of those interviewed said they are less likely to watch entertainment and sports because of political statements. Given the lousy ratings for the Oscars, that says a ton. But Hollywood never listens. It just lectures more.7. MSNBC Gets Graphic: It’s 3 a.m. and your Poli Sci 101 course report needs a graph and you throw together something that looks nice but is utterly inane. That’s what it looked like when “MSNBC aired the saddest graph ever,” wrote Daily Caller’s Amber Athey.She was calling out the network for an exercise in graphic violence created for MSNBC’s “The Beat.” Some poor designer created a graph of the number of times Trump tweeted about Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The chart, titled “Trump Tweets Mentioning Mueller By Name.” runs from May 2017 to March 2018. Every month has the graph at 0. Then in March, it takes a huge leap … to 2.This is why you should believe it when you hear commentators say Trump has driven the media crazy. Here’s proof. "

That amount of data is said to far exceed the total content of the Library of Congress.""Just in case you're wondering, they're not admiring our work,"" FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said.

But the grand jury indictment, filed in a federal court in New York City, is part of the government's ""name and shame"" strategy to publicly identify foreign hackers, block them from traveling without risk of arrest and put their countries on notice.""People travel.

Rumors continue to swirl and speculation abounds about whether President Trump will order the firing of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian meddling in our 2016 presidential election and alleged misconduct by the Trump campaign and the president.President Trump is a high-risk, high-reward player and he often wins. He’s a man of action who is impatient with delays. But in this case, he needs patience. He needs to let the Mueller probe finish on its own time, politically and legally, because that’s the only way for the president to shut down all the speculation and be cleared of doing anything wrong.So firing Mueller should be off the table – something President Trump doesn’t even consider. The president needs to focus on his job, do his best to serve the American people, and just hit pause and stop being preoccupied by the Mueller probe. Talking about it and tweeting about it again and again, day after day, simply creates more news coverage and more public concern about the investigation.For obvious reasons, the president is frustrated. Who wouldn’t be? The “Russia collusion” story is at a dead end. In terms of what is on the public record, the claims of collusion don’t add up. Indeed, the facts known to the public point toward illegal collusion among top Obama administration officials who apparently aimed to stop Donald Trump from becoming president, or hobble him if he won.Still, the Mueller probe continues on and on and on.The devotion of these federal employees to Clinton remains peculiar, almost religious. Perhaps it was fed by fear of the inexperienced, conservative, and irreverently tweeting candidate Trump.While federal employees have First Amendment rights to an opinion, what is now obvious is that some abused their positions and power and engaged in a conspiracy to bend the law to serve their opinions. That is not acceptable or excusable, regardless of whether it is directed against a Democratic or Republican candidate.What is also obvious is that the conspiracy to undermine President Trump both before and after he took office was undertaken without compunction, with gloves-off zeal and continued into 2017.Andrew McCabe, former No. 2 official at the FBI, was recently fired for substantive, non-political reasons. His self-defense was breathtaking. He wrapped himself in the American flag and in the FBI’s reputation for integrity. But he failed to rebut nonpartisan infractions detailed by the Justice Department Inspector General’s Office, the department’s Office of Professional Responsibility and Justice Department leadership.Distilled from an array of 2016 election-focused investigations – some already completed, some ongoing—here are some key facts:· The largest cache of Hillary Clinton recovered emails – a topic we are all sick of talking about – cast the Democratic presidential candidate in a very negative light. McCabe and others chose not to release the emails when they were found in September 2016. That is unforgivable.· The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (ACT) court, meant to protect all Americans from abuse by a politically twisted Justice Department, was tricked. The FBI’s McCabe, Director James Comey and others knowingly sought and gained an invasive warrant to surveil members of the Trump campaign by using information paid for by the Clinton campaign. Without that information, the surveillance warrant – by their own admission – would not have been granted. That is unforgivable.· Increasingly, it looks like the zealous effort to first stop candidate Trump and then undermine President Trump had appendages. One reason McCabe was summarily let go, without his full pension, is that he was allegedly untruthful under oath multiple times about leaking anti-Trump material to the media.· Curiously, Comey, who knowingly reverted to calling the Clinton “investigation” a “matter” during the election campaign when directed by Obama’s attorney general, reportedly leaked sensitive law enforcement information to the media.· Likewise, one reason former British spy Christopher Steele of dossier fame was let go by the FBI, which had mysteriously contracted with him to provide information about Trump, was that Steele had also been briefing the media on anti-Trump material.These are just some of the holes in the anti-Trump narrative alleging misconduct by the candidate and his campaign. Put it all together and so far – as far as we know from what’s public – and the accusations just don’t add up.The biggest take-away is this: If collusion is a bad thing – and for undermining the integrity of any federal election it is – the white-hot spotlight belongs elsewhere, and seems to be moving that way.Why, then, should the Mueller probe continue?The reason is simple, legal and is why our impatient president and his supporters – including all those unfairly accused, unjustifiably hobbled, and frustratingly made to wait – should take a deep breath, stop being preoccupied by the probe and simply let it finish.The reports that special counsels and prosecutors typically issue at the end of their inquiries – on average after 22 months of investigation – are usually thorough. Sometimes a prosecutor “colors outside the lines,” nabbing side players for singular acts of obstruction, perjury without a predicate act, or for unrelated misconduct discovered in the course of an investigation. But generally they focus on the mission and don’t go too far afield.In this case, reams of exculpatory information have found their way into the media, chiefly by way of congressional investigators and private sources, validating President Trump’s contention of innocence.Additionally, this information shows that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government is a bad actor – no surprise – and that all Americans, regardless of political party, have a right to be unsettled, indignant, and on guard against Russian meddling in our elections.But none of this implicates President Trump in any wrongdoing. In fact, Mueller’s probe is helping protect America by ferreting out how pervasive, invasive and invidious the Russian intentions are.So, in the end, the president and his team have a right to that clean bill of health, whether he answers more questions or lets the record speak for itself. He needs a timely conclusion to the Mueller probe, in order to best serve America’s domestic, international and national interests – to do his job unencumbered by this pasty, perfidious fiction, propagated by misguided former federal officials.Let Mueller reach that conclusion without interference, and the president and our country will be better off."

Because the schools at the time were hostile to these immigrants, he initiated Catholic schools to provide children with a good education sensitive to their religion and to prepare them as responsible, patriotic citizens. The schools worked. Many remain open to this day, their mission unchanged.The second event was the recent funeral of a great African-American woman, Dolores Grier. A convert to Catholicism, she was named vice chancellor of the archdiocese three decades ago by Cardinal John O’Connor; she was the first layperson and first woman to hold the prestigious position. Grier was passionate about civil rights, especially the right to life of babies in the womb. She never missed an opportunity to defend, lovingly but forcefully, their right to life.Grier attributed her pro-life sensitivity to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who preached that abortion was an act of genocide against minorities. No wonder, she often observed, abortuaries were clustered in poor black and brown neighborhoods. The statistics today confirm her observation: In 2013 there were more black babies aborted in New York City (29,007) than were born here (24,758), according to a report from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.More sobering, what is already the most radical abortion license in the country may soon be even more morbidly expanded. For instance, under the proposed Reproductive Health Act, doctors would not be required to care for a baby who survives an abortion. The newborn simply would be allowed to die without any legal implications. And abortions would be legal up to the moment of birth.The “big tent” of the Democratic Party now seems a pup tent. Annafi Wahed, a former staffer to Hillary Clinton, recently wrote in this newspaper about her experience attending the Conservative Political Action Conference. She complimented the conservative attendees, pointing out that most made her feel welcome at their meeting. They listened attentively to her views — a courtesy, she had to admit, that would not be given to them at a meeting of political liberals.To Archbishop Hughes, Dolores Grier, and Grandma Dolan, I’m sorry to have to write this.

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/23/infomercial-myth-trump-won-white-house-despite-cable-news.html","Ross Douthat, the consistently provocative New York Times columnist, had a personal reason for being put off by Donald Trump's prowess at dominating television.Douthat, a conservative who is fiercely anti-Trump, was a CNN contributor during the 2016 campaign. He writes that ""a network like CNN, which thrives on Team Red vs. Team Blue conflict, felt compelled to turn airtime over to Trump surrogates like Jeffrey Lord and Corey Lewandowski and Kayleigh McEnany because their regular stable of conservative commentators (I was one of them) simply wasn't pro-Trump enough.""He has a point—though those few were greatly outnumbered by never-Trumpers—but harbors some misconceptions when it comes to the president and TV news.Since Cambridge worked for the Trump campaign, the column says that whatever voter data the company improperly mined is much less important than Trump’s ""hacking"" of television.Douthat argues that Trump created phony news for years as the host of ""The Apprentice,"" saying many Republican viewers ""bought the fake news that his television program and its network sponsors gladly sold them.""Trump's real sin, says Douthat, ""was the use of his celebrity to turn news channels into infomercials for his campaign ... With television news there were actual human beings, charged with exercising news judgment and inclined to posture as civic-minded actors when it suits them, making the decision to hand day after day of free coverage to Donald Trump’s rallies, outrages, feuds and personal attacks.""Here he misses the boat. Trump dominated TV news because he knows how to drive a media agenda, and because he did hundreds and hundreds of interviews.At a time when it was difficult for shows (including mine) to get many sitdowns with Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and especially Jeb Bush—and when they were cautious when they did appear—Trump did all the channels even when he knew he was going to get beat up. He did Sunday shows, morning shows, nighttime shows and cable shows (including on CNN and MSNBC).And he made news, especially by challenging the anchors and reporters, either in the moment or later on Twitter. What's more, an awful lot of his coverage was negative. And he was often at odds with Fox News then, even blowing off the network's Iowa debate.Sure, cable news covered too many of his rallies because they were good for ratings. But that was a minor factor in his non-stop media blitz.Douthat also makes a pretty audacious declaration:""The depth and breadth of Trump skepticism among right-wing pundits was a pretty solid indicator of his unfitness for high office.""Sorry, but the consensus of National Review, the Weekly Standard, Charles Krauthammer, George Will, Rich Lowry, Steve Hayes and Ross Douthat didn’t ultimately matter, because Trump was able to forge his own connection with Republican voters and disaffected Democrats. He didn’t run as a doctrinaire conservative, which cost him the backing of many conservative pundits and scrambled the usual left-right argument. But in the end that mattered more to elite opinion-makers than the working-class voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.National Review’s Jim Geraghty, responding to Douthat, takes a much broader view beyond cable news. He notes that Trump had been on ""SNL"" and the ""Tonight"" show, in ""Home Alone 2"" and even popped up in Bobby Brown music videos:""Trump had enjoyed the pop-culture and big-media seal of approval for decades!""Television’s coverage of Donald Trump from the 1980s to early 2015 portrayed Trump as a phenomenal business success, endlessly knowledgeable and fascinating, insightful, shrewd, entertaining, and funny — a larger-than-life character. Why are so many baffled that Trump managed to turn that image into a path to the presidency?""Two days before the election, Douthat warned that voting for Trump would install ""a man who stands well outside the norms of American presidential politics, who has displayed a naked contempt for republican institutions and constitutional constraints, who deliberately injects noxious conspiracy theories into political conversation, who has tiptoed closer to the incitement of political violence than any major politician in my lifetime ...""Perhaps that’s why the notion that television served as Trump’s infomercial service sounds more like an after-the-fact justification for a victory that that virtually all the pundits insisted would never happen."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/22/ex-playboy-model-speaking-out-against-trump-but-is-it-money-grab.html","Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model who plans to tell her story tonight to CNN's Anderson Cooper, is claiming that the National Enquirer's parent company tried to intimidate her into keeping quiet about Donald Trump.But there is more to the story, which plays out in correspondence between her lawyer and the company, American Media Inc. The company's view, according to sources familiar with its stance, is that this is little more than a money grab by a woman who became dissatisfied with the $150,000 contract she had signed.The president has denied the accounts of these and other women who surfaced during the campaign, and the degree to which the public cares about their allegations remains to be seen.McDougal recently spoke to the New Yorker as it reported her account of a consensual affair with Trump starting in 2006, around the same time as the alleged relationship with Daniels. She did not address the affair directly, but Ronan Farrow obtained, most likely from her boyfriend, notes she made about the relationship during or after the 2016 campaign.But the contract also called on McDougal to write columns and appear on two magazine covers, which became a point of contention.Last month, McDougal's then-lawyer, Carol Heller, wrote to AMI that they were inundated with questions about her relationship with the company and wanted to do interviews. (McDougal is allowed to respond to ""legitimate press inquiries"" under a contract amendment added after the 2016 election.) Heller also raised the notion of renegotiating the deal—which the company viewed as a way of demanding more money in exchange for staying quiet about Trump.AMI wrote back that the wave of questions was McDougal's own fault, as a result of talking to the New Yorker's Ronan Farrow. The company said it was negotiating the sale of McDougal's limited life rights, and that those talks would be damaged by any further publicity. This, said AMI, would a breach of McDougal’s contract and subject her to substantial financial damages.Her new lawyer, Peter Stris, may have had this in mind when he said ""a quarter billion dollar company posing as a media organization systematically intimidated and silenced Karen McDougal in order to achieve its political and financial ends, and she will no longer be quiet."" (Stris did not respond to a request for comment.)McDougal said in her own statement that ""AMI lied to me, made empty promises, and repeatedly intimidated and manipulated me.""AMI denied trying to silence McDougal, saying in a statement that she ""has been free to respond to press inquiries about her relationship with President Trump since 2016.""The sources said AMI had been approached by a network and was in talks about producing a story on the alleged McDougal-Trump relationship.AMI believes McDougal breached the contract by talking to the New Yorker and would commit an even more blatant breach if she goes ahead with the CNN interview.American Media last month agreed to feature McDougal on the cover of Men's Journal—the second of two covers required by the contract—and tried to set up a March 13 photo shoot. The company even specified that the former Playmate of the Year wouldn't have to wear a bathing suit and could choose her own clothing.Despite several emails, McDougal never agreed to the photo shoot.As for her columns, McDougal herself wrote to AMI earlier this month and balked at a request to write a second piece for the month, saying she is only obligated to write one a month. (The contract calls for six columns a month but the understanding is that a single monthly piece would run in six outlets.) This correspondence would seem to undercut McDougal's argument that AMI wasn’t giving her enough exposure under the deal.As with Stormy Daniels, the lawyers will fight over the fine print and whether both women are flouting non-disclosure agreements that they voluntarily signed.The question for the court of public opinion is whether Trump and his tabloid ally are trying to suppress both women’s stories. Unlike Bill Clinton, the alleged infidelities occurred back when he was a celebrity businessman, not living in the White House."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/21/as-mueller-probe-heats-up-are-media-pushing-impeachment.html","Even as Robert Mueller has put forth no evidence tying Donald Trump to Russian collusion, are the media, not so subtly, pushing the idea of impeachment?It certainly seems to be a hot topic, though it remains unclear what the grounds would be, beyond the fact that Democrats think he's doing a lousy job.Slate even drew up some draft articles of impeachment. Oh wait—that was published last May.The New Yorker just happened to profile ""The New York Congressman Who Could Lead an Impeachment Charge Against President Trump."" Jerry Nadler is quoted as saying ""this president presents the greatest threat to constitutional liberty and the functioning of our government in living memory."" (Perhaps he doesn’t remember Richard Nixon.)Nate Silver’s 538 site just happened to lay out how ""The Midterms Could Set Trump On A Path Toward Impeachment.""This is what's making the I-word a hot topic, the growing media consensus that the Democrats have a very good shot at winning back the House this fall. And the idea of the opposition party taking control of the committees and investigative machinery is, according to this theory, just a short distance from trying to boot Trump from office.Now the post-2018 calculation could change if Trump were not just to criticize Mueller but actually fire him, which the press portrays as a real possibility but which the White House insists won't happen. Lindsey Graham said yesterday such a firing would ""probably"" be an impeachable offense if it was done without cause.Even some Republicans are talking up the prospect, undoubtedly to motivate their voters to stop Nancy Pelosi and company. Wisconsin GOP Rep. Sean Duffy told the Hill, ""Of course they're going to impeach Donald Trump. Do you think that MSNBC or CNN would allow for anything less?""(Steve Bannon, as I revealed in my book, warned Trump that impeachment would definitely happen if Pelosi's party won the House.)The idea still feels far-fetched to me, since it would announce to the public that the new Democratic majority cares more about ousting the president than pushing a legislative agenda.Any discussion of impeachment—and the previous examples involving Andrew Johnson, Nixon and Bill Clinton—starts with the recognition that ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" is whatever a majority of the House says it is. But the founders intended it as a rare constitutional remedy.In his Times review of two impeachment books, Andrew Sullivan, the conservative writer and former blogger who came to take a positive view of Barack Obama and despises Trump, acknowledges as much.Sullivan writes: ""What about passively cooperating with a foreign power to subvert an American election and then, after clear proof of such interference, refusing to counter that foreign power's intent to disrupt the next election too? If a president unwittingly benefited from a foreign foe’s meddling ('no collusion!'), and he's merely guilty of failing to do enough to counter that power's continuing assault on the American democratic process, he's in the clear. But if he is actively neglecting a defense of this country's electoral integrity because he believes the Kremlin helped him win an election in the past, and will almost certainly help him and his party in the near future, then impeachment is a no-brainer. If he knew of the meddling at the time and encouraged it, ditto ... ""The trouble here is that we have, so far, no proof of anything but a willingness to collude with a foreign power's interference; and no clear evidence at all of the president’s personal involvement with foreign actors.""The British-born journalist concludes that ""you can impeach a president, but you can't, alas, impeach the people. They voted for the kind of monarchy the American republic was designed, above all else, to resist.""That is the bottom line, no matter how much Sullivan and others may disapprove of the outcome. Trump won the Electoral College and undoubtedly would have won without Moscow's efforts. The notion of impeachment may be good for clicks and ratings, but for now it's wishful thinking by the anti-Trump crowd."

Guns are part of my family’s culture. I like target shooting. I don’t think guns are a bad thing,’” Noel King noted.“What do you say to a 17-year-old who fundamentally disagrees with you about some of this stuff?” King asked.“Well, I say we’re marching to protect you from other people like you who have guns,” Kasky said. “And I say that target shooting, while it is a sport, we’ve become the targets.”“We’re the targets now,” Kasky said. “We are running away from people like you.”The interview gave Kasky the opportunity to assert that the march, which is expected to draw as many as 500,000 to the nation’s capital and hundreds of other cities around the country and even some abroad, was still controlled by the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.But when asked about the protest’s left-wing supporters, Kasky admitted that adults helped pull off the D.C. event, which requires a federal permit, massive logistical support, and lots of money, including millions in insurance costs.King: You are working with progressive groups, though – right? – like Indivisible, which is a movement to resist the Trump agenda.

So people like Indivisible, who represent students who are in lower-income communities and don’t get to speak out the way we do because people don’t listen, we have to connect with these students.“So the leadership of this movement still is teenagers?” King asked.“Yes,” Kasky claimed. “And while we have people who help us, while we have people who can help us book hotels and get city permits, those aren’t the people controlling our message.

The Obama administration praised Runcie’s PROMISE program and likely considered it a model for the rest of the country.Nevertheless, the Broward County superintendent would prefer the focus to be on “easy access to guns” as the reason Cruz was able to obtain his firearm.Runcie denies his PROMISE program was at all instrumental in Cruz’s shooting.“Contrary to media reports, the district has no record of Nikolas Cruz committing a PROMISE eligible infraction or being assigned to PROMISE while in high school,” he writes:PROMISE is part of the district’s Code Book for Student Conduct & Discipline Policy. It is an intervention program for 13 specific non-violent, misdemeanor infractions, such as petty theft under $300, trespassing, vandalism, alcohol use and disruption of campus.The district has always been explicitly clear that we have no policies that limit or tie the hands of law enforcement in doing its job in addressing school safety.Max Eden, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, however, tells Breitbart News Runcie’s explanation warrants a closer look.“Runcie’s careful formulation contains a falsehood, several omissions, and obfuscations,” Eden says. “It doesn’t cover middle school, where Cruz racked up about two dozen offenses and was transferred into an intensive behavior management school – without ever getting an arrest record.”“Runcie claims that PROMISE only covered ‘non-violent’ offenses,” Eden observes. “That’s just straight false. The 2013 version covered assault and fighting; the 2016 version covered ‘affray,’ i.e., fighting. That means Cruz’s fights were only deemed non-PROMISE eligible based on administrator discretion, not policy.”“Given that Cruz is alleged to have threatened students, it’s also worth noting that ‘threats’ are a PROMISE-eligible offense,” he continues. “Perhaps those incidents weren’t recorded as threats. Students have reported that Cruz brought bullets and knives to school. Perhaps those incidents weren’t recorded at all. Or perhaps they were and Runcie’s statement eludes them; the discipline matrix doesn’t highlight Class B Weapons as a PROMISE-eligible Incident.”Eden urges a careful look at “the hurdles Runcie built into the new discipline matrix.”“After failing to get Cruz involuntarily committed to a mental institution, the school developed a plan: don’t let him bring a backpack because maybe he’ll kill everyone,” he explains. “Then he commits an assault. Used to be, there were four categories for assault and you could call the cops for three. But now, there were three categories and you could only call the cops for the most serious form of assault. So, despite everything about his record and insane behavior, policy prohibited administrators from sending him to law enforcement when he committed that assault … three weeks before he legally bought an AR-15.”The 2016 PROMISE collaborative agreement among the school district, law enforcement, and community partners – such as the NAACP – also resolves that the parties “follow the letter and spirit of the ESSA [federal Every Student Succeeds Act] provisions to reduce exclusionary disciplinary practices, while implementing prevention and intervention programs for children and youth who are neglected, delinquent, or at-risk.”“The parties will also follow the Department of Justice and Department of Education Guidelines on School Climate and Discipline,” the PROMISE agreement states.At a recent Heritage Foundation panel focused on the reported disorder that has resulted from the Obama-era school leniency policy, U.S. Civil Rights Commissioner Gail Heriot, a professor of law at the University of San Diego School of Law, observed that the Obama administration essentially told schools that if teachers and principals are disciplining proportionally more African American students than white or Asian students, “we’re coming after you with massive investigations and threats to cut off your funding.”“Under this approach it’s not actual race discrimination that gets schools in trouble,” Heriot noted. “It’s having ‘bad numbers.’”“Nobody disputes that African American students are disciplined at higher rates than white students or Asian students nationally,” she observed. “But what if the reason for that is that African Americans misbehave more often, and what if the cost of failure to discipline those students falls on their fellow African American students who are trying to learn amid classroom disorder?”Heriot also emphasized that white students get disciplined at rates higher than Asian students and that boys get disciplined at higher rates than girls.“Yet, no one seems very interested in those bad numbers,” she asserted.According to Heriot, it is “virtually undisputed that students who come from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to misbehave in school than students from middle-class backgrounds.”However, the U.S. Civil Rights commissioner said research shows that prior problem behavior is the best predictor of who will get suspended from school – and not race.She observes the Obama-era policy has produced two “severely negative effects”:First, it’s caused schools to back away from discipline generally, with the result of more chaotic classrooms. Second, it has led to real discrimination, where white and Asian students on the one hand, and African American students on the other, operate under different discipline rules – all in order to make the numbers look good.Heriot urges the Trump U.S. Education Department to withdraw the Dear Colleague letters establishing the lenient discipline policy and put teachers and principals back in charge.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/2nd-amendment/2018/03/24/kobach-liberal-corporations-attack-americas-gun-culture/","In the last week, liberal corporations and anti-gun interests have launched a new salvo in the gun control battle.But this time they are not merely advocating gun control policies or limiting the sale of firearms in certain stores. Instead, they are attacking America’s gun culture itself. By gun culture, I mean the culture that appreciates the value of firearms, promotes the lawful use of firearms, and respects the constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Two different developments have occurred.First, the Kroger retail giant announced that it was removing from its stores any magazines or publications that feature “assault rifles.” Kroger wasn’t specific about which magazines would go, but that could potentially remove everything from Guns & Ammo to Outdoor Life. Kroger owns nearly 3,000 supermarkets and retail stores including Kroger, Dillon’s, Fred Meyer’s and Harris Teeter. Unlike restricting the sale of firearms to buyers 21 or older, this move attacks the very notion that firearms can be the subject of collecting, sport shooting, hunting use, and popular interest. In other words, it rejects the fact that reasonable people have a legitimate interest in reading about guns.Second, YouTube announced that all videos that demonstrate firearms, promote the sale of firearms, or provide instruction on the assembly of firearms will be banned from its platform. That is a major change that will affect millions of gun owners. Gun owners often check out reviews and demonstrations posted on YouTube before buying a firearm, just like other consumers check out reviews on YouTube.It’s also unclear just how extensive the YouTube ban will be. I and many other gun owners sometimes check out instructional videos on gun maintenance on YouTube. Those videos demonstrate firearms and sometimes involve the assembly of firearms. Will they be banned as well? And what about gun safety videos? Hunting videos? Those too involve the demonstration of firearms, and they indirectly promote the sale of firearms.YouTube has become a virtual public square where millions of Americans communicate with each other on a variety of topics. It appears that this public square will soon exclude communication that involves firearms in any demonstrative way.Both of these moves are designed to inhibit the expression of ideas that is an important part of the gun culture in America. Our Founding Fathers appreciated the importance of an armed citizenry. Indeed, they declared in the Second Amendment that it was “necessary to the security of a free State.” But an armed citizenry requires a culture that supports the safe and lawful use of guns by a significant portion of the population. That culture is now under threat.Kris W. Kobach is the elected secretary of state of Kansas. Prior to becoming secretary of state, he was a professor of constitutional law at UMKC Law School from 1996 to 2011. An expert in immigration law and policy, he coauthored the Arizona SB-1070 immigration law and represented in federal court the ten ICE agents who sued to stop President Obama’s 2012 DACA amnesty.

Arnaud Beltrame was among the first officers to respond to the attack on the supermarket in the south of France on Friday.Beltrame, who first took his place among the elite police special forces in 2003 and served in Iraq in 2005, had organised a training session in the Aude region in December for just such a hostage situation. At the time, he armed his officers with paintball guns, according to Depeche du Midi, the local newspaper.“We want to be as close to real conditions as possible,” he said then.But when he went inside the supermarket on Friday, he had given up his own weapon and volunteered himself in exchange for a female hostage.Unbeknownst to the Morocco-born captor, he left his mobile phone on so police outside could hear what was happening in the store. They stormed the building when they heard gunshots, officials said. Beltrame was fatally wounded.His death raises the toll to four. The gunman was also killed, and 15 people were injured in the attack.“Arnaud Beltrame died in the service of the nation to which he had already given so much,” President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement. “In giving his life to end the deadly plan of a jihadi terrorist, he fell as a hero.”According to the statement, Beltrame joined the elite police special forces in 2003 and deployed to Iraq in 2005. He served as a member of the presidential guard and in 2012 earned one of France’s highest honours, the Order of Merit. He was married with no children.Macron has said investigators will focus on establishing how the gunman, identified by prosecutors as Morocco-born Redouane Lakdim, got his weapon and how he became radicalised.On Friday night, authorities searched a car and the apartment complex in central Carcassonne where Lakdim was believed to live.Lakdim was known to police for petty crime and drug dealing. But he was also under surveillance and since 2014 was on the so-called Fiche S list, a government register of individuals suspected of being radicalized but who have yet to perform acts of terrorism.Despite this, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said there was “no warning sign” that Lakdim would carry out an attack.A woman close to Lakdim was taken into custody over alleged links with a terrorist enterprise, Molins said. He didn’t identify her.UPDATE: ‘Allah hu Akbar’ attacker  shot dead by police. Three victims dead, a dozen wounded https://t.co/b7GqMO9v6J— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 23, 2018The four-hour drama began at 10:13 a.m. when Lakdim hijacked a car near Carcassonne, killing one person in the car and wounding the other, the prosecutor said.Lakdim then fired six shots at police officers who were on their way back from jogging near Carcassonne, said Yves Lefebvre, secretary general of SGP Police-FO police union. The police were wearing athletic clothes with police insignia. One officer was hit in the shoulder, but the injury wasn’t serious, Lefebvre said.Lakdim then went to a Super U supermarket in nearby Trebes, 60 miles (100 kilometres) southeast of Toulouse, shooting and killing two people in the market and taking an unknown number of hostages. Special police units converged on the scene while authorities blocked roads and urged residents to stay away.He shouted “Allahu Akbar!” — an Arabic phrase meaning ‘Allah is Greater’ — and said he was a “soldier of the Islamic State” as he entered the Super U, where about 50 people were inside, Molins said.“We heard an explosion — well, several explosions,” shopper Christian Guibbert told reporters. “I went to see what was happening and I saw a man lying on the floor and another person, very agitated, who had a gun in one hand and a knife in the other.”During the standoff, Lakdim requested the release of Salah Abdeslam, the sole surviving assailant of the November 2015 attacks in Paris that left 130 people dead. The interior minister suggested, however, that Abdeslam’s release wasn’t a key motive for the attack.The IS-linked Aamaq news agency said the attacker was responding to the group’s calls to target countries in the U.S.-led coalition carrying out airstrikes against IS militants in Syria and Iraq since 2014. France has been repeatedly targeted because of its participation.France has been on high alert since a series of extremist attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 200 people. One of those attacks, against a kosher supermarket in Paris, seemed to foreshadow this week’s deadly assault in the south.___Associated Press journalists Thomas Adamson, Samuel Petrequin, Sylvie Corbet, Angela Charlton and Jerome Pugmire contributed to this report from Paris.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Michelle Mortensen gets just ten percent, Scott Hammond gets nine percent, and David McKeon gets one percent. Victoria Seaman, who dropped out of the race upon Tarkanian’s entry with Trump’s endorsement, got nine percent—while 34 percent were undecided.The survey of 400 respondents was conducted from March 10 to March 11 by Strategic National, with a margin of error of 4.9 percent, and provided exclusively to Breitbart News ahead of its public release.Tarkanian, a strong supporter of President Trump, was the GOP nominee for this very seat in 2016, but lost to now Rep. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) in the general election after 2016 GOP senate nominee in Nevada, then-Rep. Joe Heck (R-NV) tanked Republicans statewide by distancing himself from Trump in the leadup to election day. Rosen is running for the U.S. Senate and is expected to face off against Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) in the November general election.Trump’s approval rating in the survey of Nevada third district GOP voters is very high. A whopping 72 percent have an “extremely favorable” opinion of Trump, and another 16 percent have a “somewhat favorable” opinion of the president. Only four percent have a “somewhat unfavorable” opinion of Trump, and just  six percent have an “extremely unfavorable” opinion of him.Tarkanian was running against Heller for the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate until Trump asked him to switch to the House race so as to give the party a better chance in the general election in both the Senate and House races.Tarkanian announced Trump’s endorsement of his congressional campaign in a statement last week. He said:I entered the U.S. Senate race after receiving an outpouring of requests from Trump supporters throughout Nevada, many of whom stood by both me and Donald Trump in 2016. These grassroots supporters saw in me a fierce defender of President Trump’s America First agenda. Late Wednesday, the President and members of his political team reached out to me and asked me to consider supporting the America First agenda as a Congressional candidate by running again in CD3, where I nearly won in 2016 in what was one of the most expensive and closest Congressional races in America. This was not something I ever considered. In my travels throughout the state, I’ve had so many wonderful people thank me for running for the US Senate. They believe in our message and the cause. My incredible staff, mostly volunteers, have invested thousands of hours into this cause. I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to them all. I do not want to let any of them down. I have always believed that public service is doing what is in the best interest of the people you represent, not yourself politically. I believe with every ounce of my body that the future of our country, and a better life for our children, requires the implementation of the America First agenda. I am confident I would have won the US Senate race and done a great job representing the people of Nevada in the Senate, but the President is adamant that a unified Republican ticket in Nevada is the best direction for the America First movement. With President Trump’s full support and endorsement, I am filing to run again in CD3 with the firm belief that we will finish what we started in 2016 and win in 2018.That came after a Trump tweet urged Tarkanian to switch to the House race from the Senate race, adding that he would have the president’s backing in doing so.It would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada, and it’s unity if good guy Danny Tarkanian would run for Congress and Dean Heller, who is doing a really good job, could run for Senate unopposed!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 16, 2018In a subsequent appearance on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125, Tarkanian laid out the stakes of this race.“It’s a seat the Democrats currently hold, so we can take a seat back from the Democrats,” Tarkanian said. “Right now, you keep hearing all the talk that the Democrats are going to go after maybe 40 plus seats, maybe 50 seats that the Republicans hold right now, and try and switch them. This is one that’s very likely to go back to the Republican side.”In a year where Democrats are on the offensive, Tarkanian is exactly right that if the GOP has a chance of holding the House they need every advantage they can possibly get—especially pickup opportunities like this one. This particular district is one of a handful in the country where a Democrat currently represents it, but Republicans have a decent shot at a pickup. Assuming Tarkanian’s lead holds and he solidifies the nomination quickly, with Trump’s support in the general election, he will face off against Democrat Susie Lee in the general.Lee is considered an easy target to beat, given her close ties to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, and problems already piling up for her campaign.Supporters of the president and his agenda are hopeful that the other contenders in the primary clear out of the way for Tarkanian to represent the party, as the president wants, in the general election. If that happens, the district could represent a battle between two national movements: The Women’s March, #MeToo-fueled leftist resistance to Trump versus the economic nationalist conservative base of the president. Republicans and Democrats will likely both nationalize this race, and both parties are likely to compete heavily in Nevada’s third district.The suburban district just outside Las Vegas has traditionally been a swing district, but Republicans have generally held it in its current form.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Our bodies naturally punish us for drastically altering our diets, making us hungrier and trying to conserve weight it believes will protect us from starvation. Because of that, there is a real biological resistance to the obesity crisis in the modern world — and perhaps nowhere more so than the United States.Harvard School of Public Health Department of Nutrition’s chair, Dr. Frank Hu, is discouraged by the news. “It’s difficult to be optimistic at this point,” he said. “The trend of obesity has been steadily increasing in both children and adults despite many public health efforts to improve nutrition and physical activity.” He blames the “huge amount of cheap, accessible, highly processed food available everywhere almost anytime,” and a marked decrease in activity levels both at home and at work.But help may very well come from within, and the solution could be to simply prevent the body’s natural self-sabotage. By freezing the posterior vagal trunk nerve — a branch of the same nerve that controls our hearts, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract — doctors have been able to effectively shut down the mechanism which causes the compulsion to eat.In a small study by Dr. David Prologo and his associates at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, researchers employed a very simple surgical procedure in which a probe was inserted in the patient’s back to freeze the posterior vagal trunk for just two minutes. Eight women and two men were tested, this time merely to see whether the procedure had any unforeseen negative side effects or complications.No patient experienced any negative effects by either the 45-day or 90-day checkups, and the results of the procedure itself were promising. “I had struggled with weight since my 6-year-old was born … and I’m constantly rebounding [with various weight-loss programs],” said Melissa, one of the ten subjects. After the procedure, she was “literally never hungry.” Furthermore, she said, “I’m not eating because I’m bored. It’s gradually coming off, so now I know it’s not going to come right back on like all the previous diets that I’ve tried.”Whether or not this procedure has any longer-term detriments remains to be seen, as well as whether it is an effective solution for the nation’s deadliest health crisis. With a lot more study and a little more luck, it might be the best chance yet for those who struggle with maintaining a happy, healthy natural weight.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Piled upon one another, weakly thrashing, they slowly perished before a scatter of saddened onlookers. By 9:30 AM, more than half were dead.Officials shut down the beach and issued a “shark alert” in order to clear the water. Time was short and with each passing moment, there were fewer left to save. But working with these massive, powerful mammals in unpredictable weather conditions was a risk — not only for the whales but for the people desperately working to save their lives.“The strength of the animals and the windy and possibly wet weather conditions will affect when and where we attempt to move them out to sea,” said Parks and Wildlife Service Incident Controller Jeremy Chick in an update posted to their site. “The main objectives are to ensure the safety of staff and volunteers as well as the whales’ greatest chance of survival.”By noon, only 15 whales still lived. Four grueling hours later, just seven. Rocky beach and rough seas sabotaged every effort at an already difficult operation. “The conditions are challenging but we are doing all we can to give these animals the best chance of survival without risking the safety of staff and volunteers,” Chick said.The rescue efforts sustained another loss before the last six whales were returned to the ocean. Still, questions remain. No one knows exactly why such “mass strandings” take place. Was the dominant whale disoriented, or distracted by the prospect of food? Does the sonar we use for subaquatic mapping and navigation confuse creatures so attuned to its frequencies? We may never know what led to the deaths of these creatures.Fortunately, for them and for us, there are compassionate heroes willing to step in on their behalf.The remaining six surviving whales have been returned to sea.

Jeri Rhodes is listed as the executing officer for the filing.Rhodes is the Associate Executive Secretary for Finance and Administration for the Friends Committee on National Legislation, which is a Quaker lobbying group with the goal to “advance peace and justice.”Rhodes’ LinkedIn profile states that she once worked for Greenpeace.BuzzFeed News spoke with some of the “major players” behind the march last month:Major players and organizations — including Everytown, Giffords, Move On, and Women’s March LA — told BuzzFeed News they are helping with logistics, strategy, and planning for next month’s March for Our Lives rally and beyond. Much of the specific resources the groups are providing to the Parkland students remains unclear — as is the full list of supporting organizations — but there are broad outlines.Giffords, an organization started by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-AZ) that fights gun violence, is working with Everytown and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America to plan the main march on Washington — as well as sister rallies across the country.A spokesperson for Giffords told BuzzFeed News that it is “lending support in any way the students need, especially helping to operationalize these marches from logistics to programming.”“We applaud these students for demonstrating incredible leadership and demanding that our lawmakers do more to help protect Americans from gun violence,” the Giffords spokesperson said in the BuzzFeed News report.Planned Parenthood and the George Soros-funded Move On are also in the mix of left-wing groups behind the march.BuzzFeed News reported, “MoveOn said it will encourage its millions of members to follow and promote the March for Our Lives movement on social media and attend the rally” and would help with security and other logistics.A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood said it is “teaching and hosting trainings” for teens “to keep momentum going so they don’t get burned out,” BuzzFeed News reported.The NPS permit reveals “persons in charge” of the D.C. event, including Deena Katz, the co-executive producer of Dancing with the Stars who helped organized the Los Angeles Women’s March.Other “persons in charge” are Matt Hall, Ann Marie Hoffman, Paul Sorenson, and James Day.March for Our Lives also started a GoFundMe page that has raised $3.3 million. The text on the page states:The funds will be spent on the incredibly difficult and expensive process that is organizing a march like this. We have people making more specific plans, but for now, know that this is for the march and everything left over will be going to the victims’ funds.NBA Miami Heat player Dewayne Wade donated $200,000 to the march and urged others to do the same on Twitter earlier this month.They need our help!

Or donate here: https://t.co/pu10Gp76on  #GetTheBallRollin— DWade (@DwyaneWade) March 10, 2018There is no list of supporters or donors on the March for Our Lives official website, and a map of the locations for all the marches allegedly taking place on Saturday includes this cryptic message: “Note that information on accessing grants to support sibling marches will be emailed directly to registered host organizers.”The NPS permit reveals more about the event, including the “event overview,” which states:Approximately (500,000) student participants and adults from across the country, will no longer risk their lives waiting for someone else to take action to stop the epidemic of mass school shootings that has become all too familiar. In the tragic wake of the seventeen lives brutally cut shot in Florida, politicians are telling us that now is not the time to talk about guns. March for Our Lives believes the time is now.The permit also says that the organizers have to spend millions on insurance for the event.Procure public and employee liability insurance from responsible companies with a minimum limitation of $2,000,000 per person for any one claim and an aggregate limit of $5,000,000 for any number of claims arising from any one incident.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/23/caroline-glick-john-boltons-appointment-america-first-move/","President Donald Trump’s decision to appoint former UN Ambassador John Bolton to serve as his National Security Advisor is arguably the most significant single step he has taken to date toward implementing his America First foreign policy since taking office.The news hit America’s enemies and competitors — from Pyongyang to Teheran to Moscow to Beijing — like a wall of bricks Thursday night.Early criticisms on the political right of Bolton’s appointment have centered on two points. First, it is argued that Bolton, who has been involved in U.S. foreign policymaking since the Reagan administration, is a creature of the Washington foreign policy swamp.While it is true that Bolton is from Washington – or Baltimore, to be precise – and although it is true that he held senior foreign policy positions in both Bush administrations, he has always been a thorn in the side of the establishment rather than a member of that establishment.For the better part of three decades, Bolton has bravely held positions that fly in the face of the establishment’s innate preference for appeasement. He was a vocal critic, for example, of then-President Bill Clinton’s disastrous nuclear diplomacy with North Korea.The 1994 “Agreed Framework” that Clinton concluded with Pyongyang was touted as a peaceful resolution of the nuclear crisis with North Korea. In exchange for shuttering – but not destroying — its nuclear installations, North Korea received light water reactors from the U.S. and massive economic relief. As Bolton warned it would, North Korea pocketed the concessions and gifts and continued to develop its nuclear weapons. In other words, far from preventing North Korea from developing nuclear weapons, the Agreed Framework preserved the North Korean nuclear program and enabled the regime to develop it effectively with U.S. assistance.For his warnings, Bolton has been reviled as a “warmonger” and a “superhawk” by the foreign policy elite, which has gone out if its way to undercut him.President George W. Bush appointed Bolton to serve as UN ambassador in 2005 in a recess appointment. Three moderate Republicans on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Lincoln Chafee (RI), Chuck Hagel (ND), and George Voinovich (OH), signaled that they would oppose Bolton’s confirmation, blocking it.At the time, rumors surfaced that then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice had quietly undercut Bolton’s confirmation in private conversations with senators. Tthose rumors were denied, and Rice publicly supported Bolton’s confirmation. But in 2016, Rice, along with her mentor, former secretary of state James Baker, and her deputy and successor as National Security Advisor, Stephen Hadley, openly opposed President Trump’s intention to appoint Bolton Deputy Secretary of Sstate. At the same time, all three lobbied Trump to appoint outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.Bolton was a vocal opponent of Rice’s nuclear diplomacy with North Korea, undertaken after Pyongyang conducted its first nuclear test in 2006. He also opposed Rice’s pursuit of diplomatic ties with Iran through negotiations in Iraq. In both cases, as events showed, Bolton’s criticisms were all in place.Rice’s nuclear diplomacy with North Korea emboldened the regime, and enabled its continued testing of nuclear weapons and development of ballistic missiles.In Iran’s case, Rice’s negotiations with the Iranians in 2007 and 2008 set the stage for president Barack Obama’s nuclear talks with Tehran, which led to the 2015 nuclear deal. That deal, like the 1994 Agreed Framework with North Korea, preserves, rather than dismantles, Iran’s nuclear program while providing Iran with the financial means to expand its regional power through its terrorist proxies.On the other hand, Bolton’s actions while in office brought extraordinary benefit to US national security. For instance, as Bush’s undersecretary of state for arms control and international security, in 2003 Bolton conceptualized and launched the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI). The purpose of the PSI was to empower nations to interdict ships suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction, delivery systems, and related materials from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern. Originally launched with 11 state members, today the PSI has 105 state members. Its members have interdicted multiple ships suspected of transferring illicit weapons systems to other states and to non-state actors.Like Trump, Bolton is an opponent of international treaties that bind the U.S. in a manner that may be antithetical to its national interests, and prefers bilateral agreements that are tailor-made to defend America’s national interests. Bolton was a firm opponent of the Rome Treaty, which established the International Criminal Court. He worked avidly to vacate America’s signature from the treaty. Due largely to his cogent opposition, the Bush administration decided not to submit the treaty to the Senate for ratification. Bolton concluded 100 bilateral treaties with nations committing them never to present complaints against U.S. military personnel before the tribunal.Bolton’s nationalist convictions, and his refusal to join the foreign policy elite in its adoration of diplomacy, whatever the substance, over a firm, fact-based pursuit of America’s national interests lies at the heart of the foreign policy establishment’s opposition to him.Indeed, the level of hostility the foreign policy establishment has directed towards Bolton over the years has been so ferocious, it is a testament to his diplomatic skills, and success, that he has managed to persevere in Washington, in and out of office for forty years.As to the second charge by conservative critics, that Bolton is a neoconservative interventionist, the fact is that he is neither a neoconservative nor is he a knee jerk interventionist. Rather, Bolton supports the judicious use of American power in the world to advance U.S. national security and economic interests when the use of force is the best way to achieve those interests.It is true that Bolton supported the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. But it is also true that he opposed the nation-building strategy that stood at the root of America’s failure to achieve its aims there.It is also true that like many of the neoconservatives, Bolton is a firm supporter of Israel. However, Bolton is actually far more supportive of Israel than the neoconservatives are. As a nationalist, he supports U.S. allies because he understands that the stronger America’s allies are, the better able they are to defend their interests. Since American allies – particularly Israel – share America’s interests, the more powerful they are, the more secure America’s interests are, and the less the U.S. needs to assert its power abroad. Bolton supported — indeed, urged — Israel to destroy Iran’s nuclear installations during the Obama presidency. Rather than treating Israel as what Rice referred to patronizingly as America’s “special friend,” Bolton views Israel as America’s most powerful ally in the Middle East. He opposes Palestinian statehood and an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.The neoconservative movement asserts that America’s values of liberal democracy are universal, and that as a consequence, when given the opportunity to choose their leaders in open elections, everyone everywhere will choose leaders that are liberal democrats.This view, for instance, stood at the root of Rice’s demand that the Hamas terrorist group participate in the Palestinian elections in 2006. It was also the root of her decision to pressure then-Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak to permit the Muslim Brotherhood to participate in parliamentary elections in Egypt in 2005.Since the neoconservatives asserted that all people believe in American values, they assessed that at the end of the day, even Hamas would govern responsibly. Bush famously raised what became known as the “pothole theory” of the moderating power of elected office.Bush said, “I like the idea of people running for office. There’s a positive effect when you run for office. Maybe some will run for office and say, vote for me, I look forward to blowing up America. I don’t know, I don’t know if that will be their platform or not. But I don’t think so. I think people who generally run for office say, vote for me, I’m looking forward to fixing your potholes, or making sure you got bread on the table.”Rice heartily concurred.Bolton, in contrast, rejected the notion that American values are universally applicable, and argued that nation building and humanitarian intervention are both antithetical to American national security interests. In other words, while he agreed with certain policies that neoconservatives also supported, he opposed the basic assumptions of the neoconservative outlook.Bolton’s opposition to nation-building and humanitarian interventionism was all borne out by events. As the so-called Arab Spring showed — and indeed, as Turkey’s democratic transformation into an Islamic theocracy also demonstrates — American values are not universal values at all. Supporting democratic processes with no concern about the values and culture those processes empower is unwise and irresponsible, and as the rise of Islamist regimes in Gaza, Egypt, Turkey, and beyond make clear, it is also antithetical to American national security interests.Bolton’s healthy skepticism for international agreements; his support for a foreign policy that prioritizes the advancement of American national interests over multilateral diplomacy; and his belief that Obama’s signature diplomatic achievement, the nuclear deal with Iran, is a disaster, all make him the senior diplomat most aligned with President Trump’s America First agenda in Washington.The combination of Trump and Bolton no doubt puts fear in the hearts of America’s enemies, and heartens America’s allies. Given the hatred Bolton inspires in the Washington swamp, it took great courage for Trump to appoint him. America and its allies will be the primary beneficiaries of this bold move.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/23/omnibus-bill-donald-trump-signs-taylor-force-act-defund-palestinian-terror-milestone/","President Donald Trump signed the Taylor Force Act on Friday, which was attached to the omnibus spending bill and passed into law along with the rest of the legislation.Trump has been excoriated by conservatives for signing the omnibus, a bloated package that gave Democrats almost everything they wanted except amnesty for illegal aliens. But the passage of the Taylor Force Act is a silver lining — and a milestone in foreign policy that could save taxpayers money.The Taylor Force Act will end U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority (PA) as long as it pays stipends to Palestinian terrorists — either those in Israeli prisons, or the families of those who are deceased.Named for a U.S. Army veteran who was stabbed to death by a Palestinian terrorist while he was visiting Israel in 2016, the law was championed by Republicans. Democrats, worried about protecting the PA’s $300 million in annual U.S. aid, were slow to warm to the legislation. It passed the House, but struggled in the Senate.Theoretically, the bill could have — and, arguably, should have — passed on its own. But the bill’s sponsors decided to overcome Democratic opposition by adding it to the omnibus bill, which Senate Democrats were keen to pass.Though the Trump administration had repeatedly asked the PA to stop the payments to terrorists, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas made it clear he had no intention of doing so. Unless he changes his stance, the Taylor Force Act will force drastic cuts to the PA for all but humanitarian aid.The potential implications of the Taylor Force Act are profound. For the first time, the PA will pay a direct price for supporting terror indirectly. Other countries may follow suit. And the U.S. will speak with greater moral clarity about the principle that terrorism is inexcusable.With the PA under pressure to back away from supporting a culture of terror and incitement, it is possible that peace negotiations will be possible — or that the PA will lurch toward financial collapse, perhaps to be followed by Israel annexing Judea and Samara (the West Bank). The choice is in Palestinians’ hands.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News. He was named to Forward’s 50 “most influential” Jews in 2017.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/23/afghan-national-security-adviser-number-of-foreign-fighters-in-afghanistan-growing/","Afghanistan’s national security adviser said Thursday in Washington that the number of foreign fighters flocking to Afghanistan is increasing — an alarming trend that could portend continued U.S. involvement in the war.“Unfortunately, there has been a growth of foreign fighters,”Afghan National Security Adviser Mohammad Hanif Atmar said Thursday at the United States Institute of Peace.“We’re talking about hundreds of them coming from the Middle East through Pakistan and other regional routes,” he said.He named members of groups including Al Qaeda, the Islamic State, the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, Lashkar-e-Taiba, Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, and Jaish al Mohammed.The routes for some of these groups are long: Atmar said members of the East Turkestan Islamic Movement went from western China, into Vietnam, into Indonesia, into Turkey, into Pakistan, and then into Afghanistan.He said those groups are distinct from the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani Network — who are composed of Afghans with the goal of returning Taliban rule and expelling Western troops.Foreign fighters, rather, have moved to the region to take advantage of the lucrative opium trade to fund their extremism and terrorist activities. The two types, he said, have a “symbiotic relationship.”“The foreign fighters need the Taliban as their local host and protector. And the Taliban need them for their knowledge and expertise and resources,” he said.Foreign fighters using the region to fuel their operations is not a new phenomenon.The largely ungoverned border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan has been home to terrorist groups for at least four decades. It is where Al Qaeda’s now deceased leader Osama bin Laden planned the 9/11 attacks on the U.S.However, the U.S. military had worked throughout the last two decades to decimate Al Qaeda in the region. Pakistan also intermittently cracked down on terrorists on their side of the border.Atmar said after the Obama administration began drawing down U.S. forces and ended the combat mission in 2014, the numbers began increasing again. ISIS declared a new branch in Afghanistan in 2015, called ISIS-Khorasan.U.S. military officials in November estimated ISIS-K to be about 1,100 fighters, but have not given an updated number since then, according to Stars and Stripes.An increase of foreign fighters would not bode well for the Trump administration, which has been wary of drawing down too quickly and allowing the country to once again become a staging ground for another 9/11 attack.Last year, President Trump announced a new Afghanistan strategy, that entailed sending 4,000 more U.S. troops, having U.S. troops advise Afghan forces closer to the battlefield, and allowing commanders more authority to go after the Taliban.Atmar said despite a recent uptick in terrorist attacks in Kabul, the Trump administration’s South Asia strategy has helped reduce violence in the country.“Since the launch of the strategy … we already see a reduction in violence from 120 districts down to 80-plus districts. We see a significant degradation of the insurgents’ capabilities, and we see a significant increase in the operation of the special forces of Afghanistan,” he told Breitbart News in a question and answer session.“So operationally, the strategy is already having an impact,” he said. “And the insurgents and the foreign terrorists are actually trying to commit urban violence to show that the strategy is not working. But the truth is that in rural areas, it is already working.”He added all major population centers are secured by the Afghan National Security Forces, and there is a growing commando force. “So it’s important to see the progress that’s being made on the security front.”Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters last week after an unannounced visit to Afghanistan that the Taliban had ceased making gains for months. “Right now, it’s clear the wind has gone out of the Taliban’s sails some months ago,” he said.Atmar said he is optimistic about peace talks. Last month, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani offered unconditional peace talks to the Taliban. The Taliban leadership has not formally responded, but this week encouraged its members to discuss the offer.Atmar said the idea for peace talks actually came from some within the Taliban, who have not come out publicly out of fear for their and their families’ safety. He said the plan is to try to peel off those within the Taliban who are reconcilable, and fight those who are not.Atmar blamed outside actors, including Russia, for inflaming the situation inside Afghanistan.According to report, Russia has been arming the Taliban to fight against ISIS. “Not only is this unethical, but in terms of policy, this is self-defeating,” Atmar said.He also noted that Russia has accused the U.S. of bringing ISIS fighters into northern Afghanistan. “If you have any evidence, please produce it … But if you don’t have evidence, we do have evidence that we would like you to take a look at,” he said.Atmar said China, worried about East Turkestan Islamic Movement extremists, is “fully supportive” of the peace process, but believes that the Taliban must be encouraged to come to the table through incentives.Atmar said Afghanistan holds a “slight difference of view,” and believes that Pakistan should provide the Taliban with disincentives, such as by cracking down on Taliban fighters seeking safe haven in Pakistan.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

In 1996, Congress created a limited line-item veto which was used by then-President Bill Clinton dozens of times, often limiting federal spending.The line-item veto was quickly found to be a violation of the Constitution’s Presentment Clause by a 6-3 majority of the U.S. Supreme Court. That decision, in Clinton v. City of New York, strongly suggests a new line-item veto would require a constitutional amendment.The line-item was a rallying point of the GOP platform for much of the 1990s, featuring in Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey’s fabled 1994 “Contract with America” that helped deliver one of the largest mid-term election victories in American history. The idea was that, armed with the ability to remove particularly troublesome spending provisions from large bundled “must-pass” bills, the president could help rein in spending.As for this spending bill, the second largest in U.S. history, Trump quickly made clear he was signing under protest, slamming Democrats for refusing to consider proper border wall funding and a legislative compromise for the 800,000 illegal aliens covered by President Barack Obama’s now-rescinded Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. He also criticized the Congress as a whole for proposing and passing such large, imperfect spending legislation with insufficient time to read the bill. “Nobody read it,” the President said.Failing to sign the bill could have set up a government shutdown as early as midnight Friday. Trump focused on some of what he saw as the bill’s positives, including some limited new funding for border security. Homeland Security Secretary Kristjen Nielsen called the bill’s language a “down payment” on President Trump’s signature southern border wall.“I will never sign another bill like this again,” Trump claimed, but, while an end to the Senate’s traditional filibuster rule is possible with a bare Republican majority, the political campaign necessary to usher through a constitutional amendment for a line-item veto is likely out of reach in the current political climate.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Buckley, and even Richard Nixon, “who could claim Trump as his spiritual love child.”Magary harbors special animus toward Russell Kirk, who in trying to formulate the tenets of conservatism, “never addresses racism, or sexism, or environmental issues.” In other words, Kirk committed the utterly inexcusable oversight of failing to foresee and embrace the identity politics that defined the Democratic party in its ill-fated bid for the presidency in 2016.As a group, Republicans suffer from a “blithe disinterest in progress,” a “complete lack of recognition of injustice,” “lionization of intractability,” “hatred of working government,” a “hilarious lack of creativity,” and “the Pence-ian lust to control everyone’s ‘passions.’”Mr. Magary declares that he does understand the principled opposition to the Soviet Union during the Cold War, explaining it as follows: “I am a greedy capitalist at heart, and I do not like the prospect of a Commie Russia endgame any more than they did.”For their part, the nation’s Founding Fathers suffered from “blind spots to the oppressed” when they drafted the Constitution, Magary declares, “so no wonder conservatives are so eager to adhere to that document literally.”Magary’s singular accomplishment in this extraordinary essay is to have verbally abused so many conservatives living and dead in just 2,200 words, all the while saying almost nothing of substance.Magary does make one valid point, however. He correctly notes that the fathers of modern conservatism—William F. Buckley, Russell Kirk, Milton Friedman—are “all dead now,” which cannot be argued with. Readers are left to wonder what relevance this fact has to the rest of the piece, but in this, at least, they cannot accuse Magary of manufacturing fake news.Otherwise, the essay is an exercise in what liberals do best: expressing how they feel. And Magary feels angry. Very angry. Utterly bereft of reasonable arguments, the article reads like a high school sophomore’s diary entry the evening after being called in for a tongue-lashing from the school principle.If this is what passes for serious commentary in the GQ world—written apparently for a cadre of fashion-minded drones walking in unthinking liberal lockstep—then the left’s intellectual firepower is at an all-time low.Outside the bubble, at least for the moment, right-thinking people can breathe easily knowing that their opponents are too busy outdoing one another in bashing dead conservatives to notice what is actually happening in the world.Follow Thomas D.

The IRGC outsourced cyber intrusions to The Mabna Institute, a hacker network that infiltrated hundreds of universities to steal sensitive data. We will not tolerate the theft of U.S. intellectual property, or intrusions into our research institutions and universities. Treasury will continue to systematically use our sanctions authorities to shine a light on the Iranian regime’s malicious cyber practices, and hold it accountable for criminal cyber-attacks.According to the Treasury Department:The Mabna Institute is an Iran-based company that engaged in the theft of personal identifiers and economic resources for private financial gain. The organization was founded in or about 2013 to assist Iranian universities and scientific and research organizations in obtaining access to non-Iranian scientific resources. The Mabna Institute also contracted with Iranian governmental and private entities to conduct hacking activities on its behalf.In addition to the designations related to the activities of the Mabna Institute, OFAC also designated Behzad Mesri, 29, known as “Sokoote Vahshat” (which means “Silent Fear” in Persian), for “engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled misappropriation of economic resources, personal identifiers, and financial information for private financial gain for activities targeting a U.S. media company.”Mesri was hit with criminal charges, accused of hacking HBO and prematurely releasing several Game of Thrones scripts, episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm, and private executive emails.In December 2015, a Santa Barbara lead security researcher discovered that Iranian hackers were behind the hacking of housing files at the University of California, Santa Barbara.Adelle Nazarian is a politics and national security reporter for Breitbart News.

They want to get your situation taken care of. The Democrats fought us. They fought every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill. [Emphasis added]And as you know, DACA is also tied to the wall, for the major funding, the $25 billion for wall and other things. So I think that will be coming up very soon. But I do want the Hispanic community to know and DACA recipients to know that Republicans are much more on your side than the Democrats who are using you for their own purposes. [Emphasis added]The Trump administration had been looking to give amnesty to DACA illegal aliens in exchange for full border wall funding and a reduction in legal immigration levels, but Democrats blocked the plan.A DACA amnesty, though, would come with tremendous costs for American citizens.For example, a DACA amnesty would put more citizen children of illegal aliens — known as “anchor babies” — on federal welfare, as Breitbart News reported, while American taxpayers would be left with, potentially, a $26 billion bill.Additionally, about one in five DACA illegal aliens, after an amnesty, would end up on food stamps, while at least one in seven would go on Medicaid.Any plan to give amnesty to DACA illegal aliens that does not also include provisions to halve legal immigration levels — the U.S. admits more than one million legal immigrants a year at the expense of America’s working and middle class — would give amnestied illegal aliens the opportunity to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country.At the southern border, a DACA amnesty has the potential to trigger a border surge that could triple the number of illegal aliens pouring through the border. Since DACA’s inception, more than 2,100 recipients of the program have been kicked off because they were found to be either criminals or gang members.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/23/congress-broken-say-pro-life-leaders-gop-broken-promises-omnibus/","The omnibus spending bill is drawing the ire of national pro-life leaders and members of Congress who say many Republicans have broken their promises to the base of the party by funding Planned Parenthood and rejecting an amendment that would provide conscience protections for healthcare workers who refuse to participate in abortions.“It is incredibly disheartening that conscience language was not included especially given that it is reflective of the majority of Americans’ views in addition to the fact that for 10 years strong this has been a priority for pro-life groups, who received assurance from Leadership that it was also a priority,” said Vice President of Government Affairs for March for Life, Tom McClusky. “In addition, included in this bill is continued funding for our nation’s largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood, despite the current investigations into the trafficking of baby parts and the recent GAO report confirming the billions of taxpayer dollars it has received in recent years.”McClusky told Breitbart News pro-life leaders were told the Conscience Protection Act was a priority for House Speaker Paul Ryan, yet it was not included in the massive spending bill.Rep. Diane Black (R-TN), who drove the effort to include the Conscience Protection Act in the omnibus – to protect healthcare workers who refuse to participate in abortions due to faith beliefs or moral convictions – voted against the spending bill:Meanwhile, conservative priorities like the #ConscienceProtectionAct weren't included. It was a bad bill and a bad process, plain and simple.— Diane Black (@RepDianeBlack) March 22, 2018With a pro-life majority in the #House & #Senate, a pro-life @POTUS in the White House, & the overwhelming support of the American people, the time to enact the #ConscienceProtectionAct is now. @SpeakerRyan @GOPLeader— Diane Black (@RepDianeBlack) March 7, 2018While the Hyde Amendment, a longstanding provision which prohibits taxpayer funding of most abortions is, as always, attached to the current spending bill, pro-life Republicans wanted it expanded so that any insurance company bailouts – if establishment members of Congress got their way – would also not allow taxpayer funds to cover abortions in their insurance plans.As the Washington Post notes, “Democrats, who wanted to preserve the ability of marketplace plans to cover abortions, rejected the additional Hyde language,” and were only willing to maintain the current status quo Hyde provision.“Under that language, marketplace plans covering abortions must collect an extra fee from customers and keep those funds separate to pay for the procedure,” the Post reports.“I think the Democrats basically decided they would rather have subsidies for plans with abortion coverage rather than have cost-sharing reductions and reinsurance to drive down premiums,” the Family Research Council’s David Christensen said.Planned Parenthood tweeted its appreciation to pro-abortion Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) for “pushing back on attempts to eliminate private insurance coverage of abortion!”:Thank you Senator @PattyMurray for standing up for women's health and pushing back on attempts to eliminate private insurance coverage of abortion! https://t.co/VUfmDtjCYz— Planned Parenthood Action (@PPact) March 22, 2018“When you have one spending bill – as opposed to 12 – we’re told, ‘Pick your priority,’” McClusky told Breitbart News. “There are other things that we’ve been fighting for – for years – that were left out of this bill, let alone defunding Planned Parenthood. So, we’re told ‘Pick your priority,’ and then when it gets closer, we’re told, ‘Do you really want to shut the government down over this – the whole government?’”“Our response is usually, ‘Yes,’ but no member of Congress wants to, and if they went through regular order, you’d only shut down one-twelfth of the government,” he added.“While we appreciate that this bill will maintain the status quo on pro-life provisions, we did not elect this Congress or President to maintain the status quo on healthcare, which funds abortion,” McClusky said.Troy Newman, president of pro-life organization Operation Rescue, said in a statement that addresses President Donald Trump, who indicated he is considering a veto of the omnibus:Mr. President, Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion business in the U.S., making them one of the largest abusers of human beings in the world. It is currently under investigation by your Department of Justice for engaging in the illegal sale of aborted baby remains for profit, as revealed in a series of authenticated undercover videos that shook the nation in 2015.Two Congressional investigations also provided evidence that there is enough probable cause to charge Planned Parenthood with multiple crimes.During your 2016 Presidential Campaign, you promised to defund Planned Parenthood. I urge you now to keep your promise and veto the Omnibus bill until it no longer provides any of our tax money to Planned Parenthood.Students for Life of America president Kristan Hawkins said in a statement that the failure of the GOP to follow through with its promise to defund Planned Parenthood shows why elections are important.“More pro-life leaders from both parties are needed to make an investment in life, not the abortion industry,” she said. “We are wasting scarce taxpayer dollars by allowing those monies to be funneled from real, full service medical centers, like Federally Qualified Health Centers, to the abortion mega-vendor, Planned Parenthood. Efforts to protect the conscience rights of Americans in the budget deserve our support, as no one should be forced into the ugly business of abortion.”Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, also said in a statement:This omnibus is nowhere close to what Republicans promised to fight for. When the American people sent us to Congress, their message was loud and their mandate clear: Secure the border; Repeal and replace Obamacare; Protect Second Amendment rights from bureaucrats in Washington; Defund Planned Parenthood; Cut wasteful spending; ‘Drain the swamp’ and change the unsustainable way Washington, D.C. does business.This budget embraces the polar opposite of these principles. We are not funding the wall. We are putting Second Amendment rights at risk. We are failing to provide families relief from Obamacare. We are still sending taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood. We are not cutting federal funds to sanctuary cities. We are growing the size of government at a break-neck pace. And we are doing all of this through a 2,300 page spending bill, written privately by four leadership members, that became public only 24 hours ago.“This is wrong,” Meadows added. “This is not the limited government conservatism our voters demand. Our constituents—our employers—deserve better.”McClusky agrees.“Congress is broken,” the pro-life leader said. “It cannot continue doing business through large ominous Omnibus or Continuing Resolutions. Until Congress repairs itself, pro-life priorities, such as much needed conscience protections, will never get passed.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

The Democrats would not do it.”Trump called on Congress to give him a line-item veto.Trump then touched on border security as a matter of national defense, “By having a strong border system, including a wall, we are in a position militarily that is very advantageous.”“This is a downpayment on a border wall system,” said Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen as she stepped up to the podium for a moment. She added that it also funds some other aspects of border security.“We have many elements in the bill that we wanted,” said Trump. $654.6 billion in discretionary funding for defense. He said it also includes upgrades for nuclear equipment. “Praise be to God that we don’t ever have to use it.” He pointed to money included to upgrade Navy ships that are in disrepair. $10.2 billion for F-35s and more for other specialized military aircraft. He said they are spending a lot of money on “very, very important” missile defense.The president then added that the bill is funding ICE agents and funding to add more immigration judges.“Nobody more disappointed than me because it’s so large,” Trump said of the funding.

For example, Trump requested “$300 million to recruit, hire, and train 500 new Border Patrol Agents” last year.The spending bill, though, only funds $7 million to hire about 350 Customs and Border Protection (CBP) “law enforcement officers” who may not end up being trained as Border Patrol agents.The lack of funding for ICE and Border Patrol is likely to result in continued pressure and strain on the federal immigration agencies. Both agencies have been under-funded for years while trying to detain the increased number of illegal aliens crossing the southern border every day, and also attempting to find, arrest, and deport the 12 to 30 million illegal aliens currently living in the U.S.Trump’s lack of increased border and interior immigration enforcement funding through the spending bill may translate into continued stagnant wages for American workers, whose pay has been flat-lined by a continued flow of cheap, illegal and legal immigrant workers.As Breitbart News reported, the spending bill will also increase the number of illegal aliens who are released into the U.S. through the Catch and Release program that has yet to end.Additionally, the spending bill bans Trump from being able to build a wall along the southern border using the prototype walls that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) commissioned.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Part of the reason for their release into the country is because the federal government refuses to fund the space needed to detain illegal aliens until their hearing.After being released, illegal aliens often do not show up for their court hearing and become quasi-fugitives living in the interior of the country, adding to the already booming 12 to 30 million illegal alien population.Local media reports across the U.S. have highlighted how the Catch and Release program has continued:Currently, according to the Washington Times’ Stephen Dinan, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been using about 40,761 beds in its detention centers on average to house illegal aliens awaiting their hearings.Ryan’s spending bill eliminates nearly 250 of those detention center beds, thus increasing the number of illegal aliens who will be released back into the U.S. through the Catch and Release program.The spending bill does not include any of the provisions from Trump’s list of pro-American immigration principles, where he called for the end of Catch and Release.Trump’s populist immigration agenda, wherein he has called on the Republican-controlled Congress to reduce overall immigration levels to raise the wages of American workers, has largely fallen on deaf ears in the GOP leadership.For the 2018 midterm elections, Republican voters have said that reducing overall illegal and legal immigration levels to the U.S. — where more than 1.5 million immigrants are admitted annually — is a bigger priority than tax reform, replacing Obamacare, and even destroying ISIS.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

This policy will apply across the firm, including to small business, commercial and institutional clients, as well as credit card partners, whether co-brand or private label. It doesn’t impact the ability of consumers to use their Citi cards at merchants of their choice.Every gun purchased at retail must already be acquired via a background check according to federal law. Citibank’s emphasis on background checks would require licensed firearms dealers to go beyond federal law and refuse to sell a gun to anyone if an instant background check lasts three business days without incriminating evidence being discovered against the would-be buyer.The emphasis on not selling long guns to 18-20 year olds, in states where such sales are legal, is also asking licensed firearms dealers to go above and beyond what federal law requires. It is legal, federally, to sell long guns to persons 18 years old and older.Citibank contends that their firearms policy is “not centered on an ideological mission to rid the world of firearms.” Rather, they said the policy is an expression of “common-sense measures that would help prevent firearms from getting into the wrong hands.”On March 9 Breitbart News reported that Visa refused to cave to a pressure campaign designed to force the company into cutting ties with certain semiautomatic rifle manufacturers.

You’re well-paid serfs, but you’re serfs. They’ve debased your currency, and so you’re continuing to underwrite debt for sovereign governments at zero interest rates, so you’re always on the spinning wheel like a little hamster, trying to get ahead,” he told the audience.“Because they’ve destroyed the ability of thrift, of you to save, to get ahead. It’s the same thing on your digital assets, your intellectual property: They take it all for free.”He added that Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg’s “entire business model” is based on these activities, “taking [your] data for free and monetising it, and then writing algorithms behind a wall that treat you like hamsters on a wheel.”BANNON ON BREXIT: It Was Breitbart London Wot Won It  https://t.co/gNn4wMKuWI— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 16, 2018Barber was keen to steer the conversation to more comfortable topics, trying to suggest Bannon was an admirer of Fascist leader Benito Mussolini and proposing that U.S. President Donald Trump’s plans for a military parade in Washington D.C. made him a kind of latter-day Julius Caesar — but failed to land any telling blows.Barber also broached the subject of Bannon’s recent speech at a conference of France’s Front National — now reconstituted as ‘National Rally’ — where he said “Let them call you racist. Let them call you xenophobes. Let them call you nativists. Wear it as a badge of honour.”“This is the great thing about the propaganda media,” answered Bannon.“If you look at that speech, I built up [to that statement] … I talked about, ‘What is economic nationalism, that Donald Trump won on?’“[Economic nationalism] doesn’t care about your race, doesn’t care about your colour, doesn’t care about your ethnicity, doesn’t care about your gender, doesn’t care about your religion, doesn’t care about your sexual preference.“It cares about one thing: that you’re a citizen of the United States of America,” he said, citing low turnout for Hilary Clinton among working-class black and Hispanic voters before the election and rising prospects for those groups after the election to show how the concept works.“That’s why I told these people, listen, the identity politics that Hilary Clinton came out with … racism, white supremacy — I sat there, and I told [the team] right there, ‘If she’s gonna run on identity politics and we run on economic nationalism — this was August 19th, and we’re down by 12 points — we are going to beat her.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2018/03/23/reporters-admit-consulting-kerry-state-dept-official-publishing-trump-dossier-articles/","NEW YORK — Jonathan M. Winer, an official in John Kerry’s State Department, vouched for the credibility of anti-Trump dossier author Christopher Steele to two reporters before they each broke separate stories about the information contained in Steele’s largely discredited dossier, the two reporters revealed in their new book.Winer gave his nod of approval for Steele to the reporters while he served at the State Department. The detail is particularly noteworthy since Winer’s purported green light was followed by one of the reporters, Michael Isikoff, penning a story on Yahoo News that was cited in a FISA court application signed by James Comey to obtain a warrant to monitor the communications of Carter Page.Isikoff’s Yahoo News article focused on alleged contacts between Page and Russian officials during a trip to Moscow.Winer later admitted that while he was at the State Department, he regularly interfaced and exchanged information with Steele, including passing anti-Trump claims to Steele that originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals. Winer also conceded that Shearer’s claims were provided to him by Clinton confident Sidney Blumenthal.Another reporter, David Corn, also disclosed that he called Winer to assess the credibility of Steele before publishing a widely cited article at Mother Jones about Steele’s claims titled, “Veteran Spy Has Given the FBI Information Alleging a Russian Operation to Cultivate Donald Trump.”Isikoff and Corn revealed their contacts with Winer in their recently released book Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump.Isikoff and Corn write that Isikoff was told about Steele’s dossier claims at a background briefing for individual reporters at the Tabard Inn in Washington, DC. The briefings were arranged by Glenn Simpson, co-founder of the controversial Fusion GPS firm, which had hired Steele for the anti-Trump work resulting in the dossier. Fusion GPS was paid for its anti-Trump work by Clinton’s 2016 campaign and the DNC via Perkins Coie.Steele briefed Isikoff in a conversation that lasted an hour, Isikoff related. “But when Isikoff left the Tabard, after a conversation that lasted about an hour, he figured he had more than enough to work with,” Isikoff and Corn wrote.Notably, other reporters at the briefing confab did not write about Steele’s claims, with some news outlets later describing the charges as unverified. The authors write that the Tabard briefing was attended by “reporters for the New York Times, the Washington Post and CNN, and Yahoo News’ Michael Isikoff.”In a recent article, New Yorker staff writer Jane Mayer reported that she personally attended one of the meetings at the Tabard and that “these encounters were surely sanctioned in some way by Fusion’s client, the Clinton campaign.” However, she wrote that at the time, Steele “provided no documentary evidence” and “neither the New Yorker nor any other news organization ran a story about the allegations.”Isikoff and Corn, however, wrote that Steele provided “more than enough” for Isikoff to “work with.”Isikoff’s next move, the authors relate, was to call Winer and another unnamed official at the State Department.The authors write:When he got back to the office, Isikoff called Jonathan Winer at the State Department; he had known Winer for years. Simpson had told him Winer could vouch for Steele. Yes, Steele was an absolutely reliable source, Winer said. Isikoff called another State Department official who had worked on Russian affairs. The source didn’t know about Page’s alleged meetings in Moscow but knew about Page. U.S. officials had taken notice of his previous trips to Russia, as well his provocative comments critical of U.S. policy and sympathetic to Putin. “He was pretty much a brazen apologist for anything Moscow did,” the official said.Isikoff did not disclose the name of the other official at the State Department.Winer previously conceded that he compiled a dossier summary and shared it with Victoria Nuland, a career diplomat who worked under the Clintons and served as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under Kerry. Nuland has not responded to Breitbart News requests for comment.After checking with Winer and the unnamed State Department official, Isikoff’s Yahoo News story ran after he also contacted Page for comment and talked with a “senior U.S. law enforcement official,” the authors write.Later in the book, Isikoff and Corn also relate that Corn checked with Winer before penning his Mother Jones article for which they write that Steele was a source.The authors state:After speaking with Steele, Corn confirmed Steele’s identity and expertise. He contacted Jonathan Winer to ask him about Steele. (Isikoff, too, had called Winer about Steele.) Speaking on background, Winer told Corn that he had worked with Steele and that he had a solid track record of collaborating with U.S. government agencies and providing them accurate and valuable information about sensitive national security matters.A four-page House Intelligence Committee memo released last month revealed that Isikoff’s September 23, 2016 Yahoo News article was cited in an Obama-era FISA application as part of the justification to seek approval for monitoring Page’s communications. The House memo says that the FISA application cited Isikoff’s article “extensively.”The House memo relates:The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016, Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff, which focuses on Page’s July 2016 trip to Moscow. This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News. The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide information to Yahoo News. Steele has admitted in British court filings that he met with Yahoo News and several other outlets in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS. Perkins Coie was aware of Steele’s initial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington, DC in 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed.The revelations that Winer was consulted by Isikoff and Corn before publishing their articles concerning Steele’s charges is not the only such disclosure in the book. The two also write that Nuland gave her approval for the FBI to first meet with Steele regarding his wild claims about Donald Trump and Russia.The book documents Steele told Fusion GPS co-founder Simpson that he believed the claims he uncovered about Trump represented a “grave national security threat” that needed to be reported to the FBI. Simpson eventually allowed Steele to report the dossier’s claims to the FBI, the book reports.Steele sought out Rome-based FBI Special Agent Michael Gaeta, with whom he had worked on a previous case. Before Gaeta met with Steele on July 5, 2016, the book relates that the FBI first secured the support of Nuland, who at the time was assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs specializing in Russia. Nuland currently serves as chief executive officer at the Center for a New American Security.Regarding the arrangements for Steele’s initial meeting with the FBI about the dossier claims, Isikoff and Corn report:There were a few hoops Gaeta had to jump through. He was assigned to the U.S. embassy in Rome. The FBI checked with Victoria Nuland’s office at the State Department: Do you support this meeting? Nuland, having found Steele’s reports on Ukraine to have been generally credible, gave the green light.Within a few days, on July 5, Gaeta arrived and headed to Steele’s office near Victoria station. Steele handed him a copy of the report. Gaeta, a seasoned FBI agent, started to read. He turned white. For a while, Gaeta said nothing. Then he remarked, “I have to report this to headquarters.”The book documents that Nuland previously received Steele’s reports on the Ukrainian crisis and had been familiar with Steele’s general work.After his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with Steele.Winer further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an “old friend.” Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal – which Winer in turn gave to Steele – originated with Cody Shearer.Shearer has numerous close personal and family connections to the Clintons and has reportedly been involved in numerous antics tied to them. National Review previously dubbed Shearer a “Creepy Clinton Confidante” and “The Strangest Character in Hillary’s Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy.”In the Post piece, Winer related that while he was at the State Department, he repeatedly passed Russia-related documents from Steele to Nuland, a career diplomat who worked under the Clintons and served as assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs under Kerry. “Over the next two years, I shared more than 100 of Steele’s reports with the Russia experts at the State Department, who continued to find them useful,” he wrote.Winer stated that in the summer of 2016, Steele “told me that he had learned of disturbing information regarding possible ties between Donald Trump, his campaign and senior Russian officials.”Winer says that he met with Steele in September 2016 to discuss details that would later become known as the anti-Trump dossier. Winer wrote that he prepared a two-page summary of Steele’s information and “shared it with Nuland, who indicated that, like me, she felt that the secretary of state needed to be made aware of this material.”Besides bringing Steele’s dossier information to the State Department, Winer conceded that he also passed information from Blumenthal to Steele, specifically charges about Trump that originated with Shearer.Winer described what he claimed was the evolution of his contacts with Blumenthal regarding Shearer’s information:In late September, I spoke with an old friend, Sidney Blumenthal, whom I met 30 years ago when I was investigating the Iran-Contra affair for then-Sen. Kerry and Blumenthal was a reporter at the Post. At the time, Russian hacking was at the front and center in the 2016 presidential campaign. The emails of Blumenthal, who had a long association with Bill and Hillary Clinton, had been hacked in 2013 through a Russian server.While talking about that hacking, Blumenthal and I discussed Steele’s reports. He showed me notes gathered by a journalist I did not know, Cody Shearer, that alleged the Russians had compromising information on Trump of a sexual and financial nature.What struck me was how some of the material echoed Steele’s but appeared to involve different sources.Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Recently, he noted that he has “never been one that thought that having a motto somewhere changes a lot of people’s thoughts.”While some in the state have raised the issue that the motto is a state endorsement of religion and, therefore, unconstitutional, the bill’s sponsor said it is a generic motto that should not bother the faithless or “people of other faiths.”“Our national motto is on our money. It’s on our license plates. It’s part of our national anthem.

As a percentage of $1.3 trillion – the total cost of the omnibus bill – this amounts to just 1.92 percent of the total.But Congress granted just $1.6 billion in border wall finance, which amounts to a paltry 0.12 percent.President Trump is now threatening to veto the bill on the grounds that it does not provide a deal for border wall funding.

All 177 Republicans voted against the bill, while only 11 Democrats opposed it.Members of the House had seen the details of the 800 page bill for the first time less than 48 hours earlier.In my 2012 book, Covenant of Liberty: The Ideological Origins of the Tea Party Movement, I described the reaction many grassroots conservatives had to this development:The speed of the process, with its self-evident disregard for more than two centuries of legislative deliberative tradtion, was shocking. Congress spent virtually no time deliberating the bill–in fact, it’s likely that the vast majority of members had not even read the bill before voting. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her Democratic troops in the House, by their actions, had just signaled their rupture with the nation’s customs and constitution, and their embrace of this new paradigm. They demonstrated the kind of absolute authority that James I would envy.The Stimulus Bill passed the Senate on February 10, 2009, and was signed into law by President Obama on February 17.Two days later, on February 19, 2009, “CNBC correspondent Rick Santelli launched the Tea Party movement with ‘the rant heard round the world.’ It lasted only about six minutes, during his regular reporting from the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The Obama administration had just announced plans for a new bailout program–this time for mortgages–and Santelli took exception.”On April 15 of that year, a million Americans gathered in over 900 cities around the nation on “Tax Day Tea Party” to protest our out-of-control federal government, and to promote the Tea Party movement’s three core values: Fiscal Responsibility, Free Markets, and Constitutionally Limited Government.The political power and energy of those Tea Party activists drove the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives in 2010, the Senate in 2014, and the Presidency in 2016.Nine years later, how have the Republican politicians who secured control largely on the basis of the political energy of these grassroots activists used that power?Ignoring the “regular order” of the budget process, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) have cut a behind-the-scenes deficit expanding $1.3 trillion “Omnibus Budget” spending deal with Democratic Minority Leader  Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).They dropped this 2,200 page fiscal monstrosity–1,000 pages longer than the Gutenberg Bible–on the desks of members of the U.S. House of Representatives just a few hours before the 256-167 vote in which the lower chamber of Congress passed the bill, and less than 24 hours before the U.S. Senate did the same.President Trump now has less than 24 hours to decide whether he will sign this terrible budget deal or veto it.If the president signs the bill, grassroots conservative activists around the country will rightfully ask this obvious question:After nine years of hard work to put Republicans into power in Washington, why should we lift a finger to help the GOP in the 2018 Congressional midterm elections if they act no differently than the Democrats did nine years ago when they held all the reins of power? MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Mueller III, enters an intense phase.“The president is disappointed that conflicts prevent Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing from joining the president’s special counsel legal team,” Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, said in a statement on Sunday morning. “However, those conflicts do not prevent them from assisting the president in other legal matters. The president looks forward to working with them.”The upheaval on the legal team comes at a critical time for Mr. Trump. The president’s former lead lawyer, John Dowd, quit the team on Thursday, just as Mr. Trump is deciding whether to sit with Mr. Mueller for an interview. At the moment, Mr. Sekulow is the president’s chief outside lawyer, as Mr. Trump’s longtime New York lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, remains on the periphery.While Mr. Trump’s lawyers, including Mr. Dowd, had told the president that the investigation would be over by this point, it seems to be accelerating, as Mr. Mueller appears to be looking into a wide range of matters related to Mr. Trump’s corporate activities, his 2016 campaign, his associates and his time in office.The president met with Mr. diGenova and Ms. Toensing, who are married, in recent days to discuss the possibility that they would join his legal team in the Mueller case. According to two people told of details about the meeting, the president did not believe he had personal chemistry with Mr. diGenova and Ms. Toensing.But beyond that, Ms. Toensing is representing Mark Corallo, who was the spokesman for Mr. Trump’s legal team in 2017 before they parted ways.Mr. Corallo has told investigators that he was concerned that a close aide to Mr. Trump, Hope Hicks, may have been planning to obstruct justice during the drafting of a statement about a meeting between a Russian lawyer and Donald Trump Jr. during the campaign.Ms. Hicks’s lawyer has strongly denied that suggestion, and White House aides said Mr. Corallo’s assertion had come up in discussions with the president as he weighed whether to go ahead with Mr. diGenova and Ms. Toensing.Mr. diGenova had been expected to serve as an outspoken voice for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on Mr. Mueller. Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president, a theory with little supporting evidence.“There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he had told Fox News in January.Earlier on Sunday, Mr. Trump took to Twitter from his Florida resort to insist that he faced no problems finding lawyers to represent him in the Russia investigation.“Fame & fortune will never be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted,” Mr. Trump said in a tweet.The president insisted that “many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case,” and that reports of flux on his team were a “Fake News narrative.” Adding new lawyers, he said, would be costly because they would take months “to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more).”“I am very happy with my existing team,” he added.The news about the canceled legal appointments came as White House officials were girding themselves for an interview on Sunday evening on the CBS program “60 Minutes” with the porn star known as Stormy Daniels.Ms. Daniels claims to have had a sexual relationship with Mr. Trump, and she signed a nondisclosure agreement with one of his lawyers, Michael D. Cohen, during the 2016 campaign.Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, will be far apart by the time the interview airs. The White House announced that the first lady would stay behind in Florida when the president returned to Washington on Sunday afternoon. A spokeswoman, Lindsay Walters, said it was “their tradition for spring break.”On Sunday, one of Mr. Trump’s closest friends, Christopher Ruddy, said the president was “perplexed” by reports of turmoil in his administration. Speaking on the ABC program “This Week,” Mr. Ruddy, who is the chief executive of Newsmax Media, said he expected the chief of staff, John F. Kelly, to stay in his job, despite the president’s chafing at what he sees as the restrictions Mr. Kelly has placed on him.But Mr. Ruddy, citing sources other than the president, said he expected the secretary of veterans affairs, David Shulkin, to leave the cabinet soon. Dr. Shulkin’s departure has been widely expected. And Mr. Ruddy played down reports that Ben Carson, the secretary of housing and urban development, was in trouble, despite Mr. Trump’s private criticism of Mr. Carson to advisers after revelations of excessive spending on an office dining room set.Ashleigh F. Barry, a spokeswoman for Dr. Shulkin, said on Sunday that there were no personnel changes at the department to announce.“President Trump has made clear that he expects the department’s sole focus to be on providing quality care to America’s veterans, who have sacrificed to keep this country free and safe,” she said.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/trump-national-security-bolton.html","WASHINGTON — The incoming national security adviser has called for the “swift takeover” of North Korea by the South. He and the newly nominated secretary of state have urged withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. The pick for C.I.A. director once oversaw interrogations in which terrorism suspects were tortured.The two generals celebrated by President Trump for their reputations for toughness are now considered the moderates — and at risk of falling out of favor.Not since the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, have key national security leaders so publicly raised the threat of military confrontation if foreign adversaries do not meet America’s demands.But George W. Bush’s war cabinet was responding to the biggest direct attack on the United States since Pearl Harbor. The current moment of peril arises from Mr. Trump’s conviction that the United States is being pushed around by adversaries who need to understand that “America First” means they have a brief window to negotiate a deal, or force may follow.Now, the members of Mr. Trump’s newly constituted team are about to face multiple, simultaneous tests of their past proclamations and sometimes conflicting instincts. North Korea and Iran pose the most immediate challenge, with Mr. Trump setting negotiation deadlines that are only months away.Over the longer term, they must straighten out the strategic incoherence surrounding Mr. Trump’s approach to Russia and China, defining the meaning of the administration’s policy declaration earlier this year that “great power competition — not terrorism — is now the primary focus of U.S. national security.”Washington is now consumed by a debate over whether Mr. Trump’s new team plans to govern as far to the right as it talks.So far, the incoming national security adviser, John R. Bolton, has declared that his past comments are “behind me.” Hours after his selection was announced, Mr. Bolton vowed that he would find ways to execute the policies that Mr. Trump was elected on, but that he would not tolerate slow-walking and leaks from bureaucrats he dismissed as “munchkins.”Some who know Mr. Bolton and his operating style predict titanic clashes.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, the retired general who has argued for keeping the Iran deal intact and warned that military confrontation with North Korea would result in “the worst kind of fighting in most people’s lifetimes,” told colleagues on Friday that he did not know if he could work with Mr. Bolton. The White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, another retired four-star general, was also unenthusiastic about Mr. Bolton’s hiring.Mr. Bolton’s harshest critics — mostly Democrats, but their ranks include some members of the Bush administration — argue that the odds of taking military action will rise dramatically when he becomes the last person a volatile American president consults.“John Bolton is not some gray bureaucrat whose views are unknown to us,” said Michael McFaul, the American ambassador to Moscow under President Barack Obama, and now a Stanford professor and the director of the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.“He’s very clear that there should be regime change in Iran and North Korea, and military force should be used to achieve those goals,” Mr. McFaul said. “If you hire him, you’re making a clear signal that’s what you want.”But others who have worked for years with Mr. Bolton argue that Mr. Trump knows exactly what he is getting: leverage, not conflict.“I think this notion everybody talks about, that the risks of war have gone up, is wrong,” said Stephen J. Hadley, who was Mr. Bush’s national security adviser and a major architect of the invasions of Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003. “This is the peace-through-strength crowd who want to make clear to people that they’re tough and that no one should cross them. But the reason for that is to deter war.”Dov Zakheim, a former senior Defense Department official who has known Mr. Bolton for 35 years, wrote on Friday that Mr. Bolton “may be a fire breather, but he is a man who cares deeply about his country,” in comparison to his boss, who “cares deeply about Donald Trump.”Whatever Mr. Trump’s motives, his selection of this team would have been hard to imagine when he first came to office declaring that the continued American presence in Iraq was a “disaster,” that he was comfortable with Japan and South Korea getting their own nuclear weapons so the United States would not have to defend them, and that America would no longer be the world’s policeman.Mr. Bolton has come to the opposite conclusion.He not only fervently advocated the attack on Saddam Hussein from his post at the State Department during the Bush administration, but he also defended its aftermath, and has said he remains convinced it was the right decision. Over the past three years, Mr. Bolton has advocated bombing Iran, attacking North Korea, and carving a new state out of Iraq and Syria.Mike Pompeo, the nominee for secretary of state, said at the Aspen Security Conference in July that the most dangerous thing about North Korea was the fact that its young, moody and reportedly ruthless leader, Kim Jong-un, controls its weapons.“So from the administration’s perspective, the most important thing we can do is separate those two. Right?” said Mr. Pompeo, who at the time was months into his current job as C.I.A. director. “Separate capacity and someone who might well have intent, and break those two apart.”Assuming that Mr. Pompeo is confirmed, he and Mr. Bolton, the two most forceful, aggressive new members of the policy team, will have to decide in what order they can risk those confrontations. The Trump administration has said it is open to direct talks with Mr. Kim by May — the same month by which the president has said he will scrap the Iran nuclear accord.“Even if you are going to be a superhawk, you can’t do all these at once,” said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, a former C.I.A. station chief in Moscow who later hunted down Pakistani nuclear technology as the Energy Department’s chief intelligence officer. “And if you want to go to war with Iran and North Korea, you have to expect to alienate your allies and run headlong into the Russians.”William J. Burns, a longtime American diplomat who was Mr. Bush’s ambassador to Russia and Mr. Obama’s deputy secretary of state, predicted that if the new team exits the Iran deal and confronts North Korea, the first beneficiary is likely to be President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.“He looks for splits,” Mr. Burns said of Mr. Putin. “He knows he will benefit if we walk away from the Iran deal, because it will put a wedge between us and our European allies.”On North Korea, Mr. Burns said, Mr. Putin is seeking “splits between the U.S. and China. We are doing his work for him.”In fact, it is in dealing with Mr. Putin that the new team is likely to run headlong into Mr. Trump’s reluctance to ever say a critical word about the Russian president. As C.I.A. chief, Mr. Pompeo has embraced the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia meddled in the election, though he changes the subject quickly when asked about it.Mr. Bolton, by contrast, has ranked among Mr. Putin’s harshest critics. Last July, days after Mr. Trump met Mr. Putin for the first time at a summit meeting in Germany, Mr. Bolton wrote that the Russian interference in the 2016 election was “a casus belli, a true act of war, and one Washington will never tolerate.”Mr. Trump did not view it that way.He emerged from the meeting in Germany repeating Mr. Putin’s observation that the Russians were too skilled at cyberoperations to be caught if involved. Last week, Mr. Trump called Mr. Putin to congratulate him on winning a Russian election widely viewed as a sham, making no mention of the recent nerve-agent attack that Britain concluded, with American agreement, was a covert action by Moscow.If it was, it was being planned out as Mr. Pompeo was acting as the host to the directors of the three major Russian intelligence services in Washington earlier this month.The unknown factor in the new mix is Gina Haspel, the career intelligence officer who has been nominated to be the first woman to run the C.I.A. Since she has spent much of her career undercover — details of which the agency is just beginning to release, in an effort to lobby for her confirmation — her foreign policy views are largely unknown.But her record in the terrorist detentions and interrogations following 9/11 is well documented. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who was tortured as a prisoner of war, this past week pointedly asked in a letter to Ms. Haspel, “Do you believe actions like these were justified, and do you believe they produced actionable intelligence?”At a moment when Mr. Trump has sided with the economic nationalists in his administration and ordered the imposition of tariffs on China to counter its restrictions on American companies and the forced transfer of American intellectual property, Mr. Bolton has gone one further.He has questioned whether the United States should abandon the “One China” policy that has been the underpinning of relations since the two countries resumed diplomatic relations.In 2016, Mr. Bolton wrote that confronting China “may involve modifying or even jettisoning the ambiguous ‘One China’ mantra, along with even more far-reaching initiatives to counter Beijing’s rapidly accelerating political and military aggressiveness in the South and East China Seas.”It is unclear how that squares with Mr. Trump’s campaign argument that the United States should pull its forces back from Asia unless South Korea and Japan pay more of the cost of keeping them there.But the most immediate decision facing the new team will be the benefits and costs of exiting the Iran deal. Mr. Trump cited his differences with Rex W. Tillerson on Iran in firing the secretary of state.Mr. Bolton and Mr. Pompeo have been among the harshest critics of the nuclear accord, but they have not said how they would manage the international backlash if Mr. Trump decides, by a May 12 legislative deadline, to resume the sanctions that the United States suspended when the deal was reached.If Washington breaches the deal, Iran may declare it is now free to resume producing nuclear fuel in unlimited quantities — limits it agreed to, for 15 years, in return for economic normalization. If so, that could put the United States and Israel back where they were in the years before the accord was reached: threatening military action to destroy Iran’s facilities, even at the risk of another Middle East war. That was the path Mr. Bolton advocated.In August, when Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Mattis wrote a joint op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal describing the merits of building economic pressure on North Korea in a policy of “strategic accountability,” Mr. Bolton said he was “appalled.”“Time is not a neutral factor here,” he said on Fox News, where he was a contributor. “More negotiation with North Korea? I think they’d say ‘bring it on.’ More time to increase the size and scope of their ballistic missile and nuclear capabilities.” He will now be preparing Mr. Trump for that negotiation.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/students-lead-huge-rallies-for-gun-control-across-the-us.html","WASHINGTON — Standing before vast crowds from Washington to Los Angeles to Parkland, Fla., the speakers — nearly all of them students, some still in elementary school — delivered an anguished and defiant message: They are “done hiding” from gun violence, and will “stop at nothing” to get politicians to finally prevent it.The students, as they seized the nation’s attention on Saturday with raised fists and tear-streaked faces, vowed that their grief about school shootings and their frustration with adults’ inaction would power a new generation of political activism.“If they continue to ignore us, to only pretend to listen, then we will take action where it counts,” Delaney Tarr, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, where a gunman killed 17 people last month, told tens of thousands rallying in Washington. “We will take action every day in every way until they simply cannot ignore us any more.”For many of the young people, the Washington rally, called March for Our Lives, was their first act of protest and the beginning of a political awakening. But that awakening may be a rude one — lawmakers in Congress have largely disregarded their pleas for action on television and social media in the five weeks since the Parkland shooting.That reality helped drive the Parkland survivors in Washington, as they led a crowd that filled blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and Capitol Hill. Thousands more rallied at about 800 “sibling” marches around the country and abroad, where students, like those in the capital, made eloquent calls for gun control and pledged to exercise their newfound political power in the midterm elections this fall.Aerial video captured seas of people — in front of Trump International Hotel in New York; in a central square in Tokyo; along the streets of Boston; at a rally in downtown Fort Worth, Tex.; and crammed into a park less than a mile from Stoneman Douglas High.Delivered in soaring speeches, emotional chants and hand-painted signs, the protesters’ messages offered angry rebukes to the National Rifle Association and politicians who have left gun laws largely intact for decades. A sign in Washington declared “Graduations, not funerals!” while another in New York said “I should be learning, not protesting.” Crowds in Chicago chanted “Fear has no place in our schools” as they marched.Celebrities, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, the “Hamilton” star, and the pop singers Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus, performed in Washington, where politicians and adult activists were largely sidelined in favor of the fresh-faced students offering stories of fear and frustration, but also hope for change.The most powerful, and impassioned, moments came from the surviving students of the Parkland shooting, who declared themselves angry, impatient and determined to stop the slaughter.“Today, we march,” Ms. Tarr said. “We fight. We roar. We prepare our signs. We raise them high. We know what we want, we know how to get it and we are not waiting any more.”An 11-year-old girl from Virginia, Naomi Wadler, captivated her audience as she declared “Never again!” on behalf of black women and girls who have been the victims of gun violence.Calls like Naomi’s stood in stark contrast to action on Capitol Hill and at the White House in the hours before the rallies. President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that took no significant new steps on gun control: It did nothing to expand background checks, impose additional limits on assault weapons, require a higher age for rifle purchases or curb the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines.The spending legislation, which was viewed as the last opportunity this year for Congress to enact major new gun restrictions before the midterm elections in November, included only some school safety measures and modest improvements to the background check system.Organizers at national gun control groups, who provided logistical support and public relations advice as the students planned the Washington rally, said they believed that the students would not become disillusioned by the lack of immediate action in Congress. They noted that rallies took place in 390 of the country’s 435 congressional districts.“The mass shooting generation is nearing voting age,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a national group that advocates tougher gun laws. “They know the midterms are six months away, and they plan to make sure that they vote and they get others to register to vote. They are absolutely poised to turn this moment into a movement.”Gun rights organizations largely stayed silent on Saturday, following vigorous efforts since the Parkland shooting to squash any movement toward significant gun control legislation. A spokesman for the N.R.A. declined repeated requests for comment.On the eve of the march, Colion Noir, a host on NRATV, an online video channel produced by the gun group, lashed out at the Parkland students, saying that “no one would know your names” if someone with a weapon had stopped the gunman at their school.“These kids ought to be marching against their own hypocritical belief structures,” he said in the video, adding: “The only reason we’ve ever heard of them is because the guns didn’t come soon enough.”Small counterprotests took place in a few cities. In Salt Lake City, several hundred people gathered near a high school, some carrying signs with messages like “AR-15’s EMPOWER the people.” Brandon McKee, who wore a pistol on his belt, brought his daughter, Kendall, 11, who held a sign that said “Criminals love gun control.”“I believe it’s their goal to unarm America, and that’s why we’re here today,” Mr. McKee said of the Washington marchers. In Boston, about 20 protesters favoring gun control confronted a small clutch of Second Amendment supporters in front of the State House. The two sides quickly got into a shouting match.The pro-gun protests were swamped in size and enthusiasm by those marching for gun control, many of whom traveled for many hours to attend the rallies in cities across the country. Sebastian Jennings, 18, said he spent 36 hours taking a bus to Washington from western Arkansas. Tour buses lined the streets.Security was tight in Washington, where military trucks and guards blocked almost every intersection near the rally amid a huge police presence, and in other cities where marches and rallies forced the closing of major roads.In towns like Dahlonega, Ga., smaller rallies sought to demonstrate a desire for new gun restrictions even in rural, Republican-leaning communities where gun ownership is common and support for the Second Amendment is strong.“We’re going to be the generation that takes down the gun lobby,” Marisa Pyle, 20, said through a red megaphone to a group of several hundred people gathered in front of the Dahlonega Gold Museum.Around the world, Americans living abroad gathered to honor those who have died in school shootings and to echo the call for gun control.Protesters in Rome jammed the sidewalk across from the American Embassy, next to the upscale Via Veneto, raising their voice in chants — “Hey hey, ho ho, the N.R.A. has got to go,” and waving signs with messages like “A gun is not fun” and “Am I next?” many made by high school students at an international school.About 150 to 200 people in Berlin gathered in solidarity in front of the Brandenburg Gate, just steps from the American Embassy. Many carried hand-painted signs, among them: “Arms should be for hugging,” “Bullets aren’t school supplies” and “Waffeln statt Waffen” (Waffles instead of weapons).One of the largest rallies outside Washington was at a Florida park not far from Stoneman Douglas High School. During that event, 17 students from the school silently took the stage to represent their friends who had been killed.Anthony Montalto, the brother of Gina Rose Montalto, one of those killed, held a sign that said: “My sister could not make it here today. I’m here for her.”“Turn this moment into a movement,” Sari Kaufman, a sophomore at Stoneman Douglas, implored the sea of students, parents and teachers. She urged her classmates to vote out of office politicians who receive money from the N.R.A. “They think we’re all talk and no action.”But the largest rally, by far, was in Washington, where stage risers and giant television monitors were set up in the shadow of the Capitol — the focus of much of the anger from students throughout the day.One protester carried a sign that said “If the opposite of pro is con, then the opposite of progress is Congress.”Most Republican and Democratic members of Congress had already left the city to return to their home districts for spring break. Mr. Trump spent Saturday afternoon in Florida, at the Trump International Golf Club, less than an hour north of Parkland. A White House spokeswoman said in a statement, “We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today.”City officials had prepared for the biggest march since about a half-million women gathered on the day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, declaring a new political movement aimed at resisting the president and his policies.On Saturday, officials with Metro, the region’s subway system, said more than 207,000 rides had been taken on the system by 1 p.m., about half of the number by that time during the Women’s March.A team of crowd science researchers led by G. Keith Still of Manchester Metropolitan University in England estimated that about 180,000 people attended the rally. They examined photographs, video and satellite imagery to estimate the crowd density in different areas of the demonstration. The number is less than half of the 470,000 that Dr. Still estimated had attended the Women’s March in Washington in 2017.Even so, the streets of Washington were packed on Saturday. Teenagers climbed on each other’s shoulders to reach the bare limbs of trees, where they climbed higher. And each student who spoke drew a cheer that matched, and even eclipsed, the applause given to the musical performers.Edna Chavez, 17, a high school senior from Los Angeles, said she had lost her brother to gun violence: “He was in high school when he passed away. It was a day like any other day. Sunset down on South Central. You hear pops, thinking they’re fireworks.”“Ricardo was his name. Can you all say it with me?” she asked. The crowd said his name over and over again, as Ms. Chavez smiled through tears.Naomi Wadler, the 11-year-old student, introduced herself with a soft “hi” and said she represented the black women who have been victims of gun violence.“People have said that I am too young to have these thoughts on my own,” she said. “People have said that I am a tool of some nameless adult. It’s not true. My friends and I might still be 11, and we might still be in elementary school, but we know.”She added, “And we know that we have seven short years until we, too, have the right to vote.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/world/middleeast/us-bombs-qaeda-libya.html","BENGHAZI, Libya — The United States military carried out its first ever drone strike against Qaeda militants in southern Libya this weekend, signaling a possibly significant expansion of the American counterterrorism campaign in the North African nation.Until now, the Pentagon had focused its counterterrorism strikes in Libya almost exclusively on Islamic State fighters and operatives farther north — eight since President Trump took office. In 2016, the military conducted nearly 500 airstrikes in the coastal city of Surt over several months to destroy the Islamic State’s stronghold there.But the attack on Saturday that the military’s Africa Command said had killed two militants — later identified by a spokeswoman as belonging to Al Qaeda’s branch in northwestern Africa — took place in the country’s southwest, a notorious haven for a deadly mix of Al Qaeda and other extremist groups that also operate in the Sahel region of Niger, Chad, Mali and Algeria.“This appears to be the continuation of expanding AFRICOM activity in Libya’s ungoverned areas,” said Deborah K. Jones, who served as United States ambassador to Libya from 2013 to 2015, referring to the Africa Command.A missile fired by the American drone struck a house in Ubari, 435 miles south of Tripoli, in an area close to major oil fields that was wracked by violent ethnic feuding in 2015. Pictures in Libyan news media outlets showed a mutilated corpse lying in the rubble of a house, and a pair of shrapnel-ridden vehicles nearby. Local residents were quoted by the media outlets as saying the house had been frequented by foreigners.In a statement, the military’s Africa Command said the strike had targeted militants with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, an affiliate also known as AQIM, and had been carried out in coordination with the United Nations-backed unity government in Tripoli. “At this time, we assess no civilians were killed in this strike,” the statement said.The strike came as the Trump administration has been reassessing the American military commitment in North and West Africa after the ambush in Niger last fall that killed four American soldiers. The Pentagon has been preparing to fly armed drone missions from Niger’s capital, Niamey, a step that diplomats and analysts say could further widen the Pentagon’s shadow war in this part of the continent.In a sign of how the Pentagon has sought to obscure its operations in Libya and other parts of northwestern Africa, the Africa Command did not announce the strike on Saturday.It responded to questions from The New York Times late Saturday with a terse statement after media reports about the strike circulated in Libya. The statement did not identify where the drone had originated.Earlier this month, in response to a Times query, the Pentagon acknowledged for the first time that Green Berets working with government forces in Niger had killed 11 Islamic State fighters in a firefight in December. No Americans were hurt in that fight, the Pentagon said.Ubari is at the intersection of the powerful criminal and jihadist currents that have washed across Libya in recent years. Roughly equidistant from Libya’s borders with Niger, Chad and Algeria, the area’s seminomadic tribesmen are heavily involved in the smuggling of weapons, drugs and illegal migrants through the lawless deserts of southern Libya.Some have allied with Islamist militias, including Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which operates across Algeria, Mali, Niger and Libya.The area erupted into conflict in 2014 when a century-old peace treaty between the Tuareg and Tebu ethnic groups collapsed over a dispute about control of the fuel smuggling trade. The fighting, which occurred independently of the broader struggle for control of Libya after the 2011 overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, raged for a year, killing hundreds and leaving many families displaced.The Tebu and Tuareg eventually struck a peace agreement, and a neutral militia currently keeps the peace in Ubari, but tensions remain. In November, Turkish engineers working at the city power station were kidnapped by unidentified gunmen, as was a Pakistani engineer at the station who went missing this month, according to local news media reports.While some Tebu groups have allied with the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, Tuareg factions have allied with Qaeda, which is also believed to have profited from the trade in smuggled fuel.In the statement on Saturday, Robyn M. Mack, a spokeswoman for the United States Africa Command, said that it was still assessing the results of the strike and that the purpose had been “to deny terrorists freedom of action and degrade their ability to reconsolidate.”But the command did not answer several other questions: Who were the two dead militants, and why were they important enough to kill with an airstrike? What role, if any, did France play in a region of Libya in which it has also conducted counterterrorism operations? And, most significantly, to what extent is the attack the start of an escalating campaign against a broad spectrum of extremists in northwestern Africa, or a one-off strike against high-profile Qaeda operatives?“Beginning a concerted strike campaign against AQIM or other AQ elements in the Sahel, akin to what we are doing in Yemen and Somalia, would mark a significant expansion of our counterterrorism efforts,” said Luke Hartig, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council during the Obama administration.“If this is going to be the start of a broader campaign, it would be helpful to hear more from the administration about the threat posed by AQIM and why it merits putting our people in harm’s way and conducting strikes,” Mr. Hartig said.A senior French security official said France had played no role in the strike, but added that Paris was “very happy of this continued commitment of the U.S. to counterterrorism in Libya.”Questions about whether the American military, under the Trump administration, is seeking to blur the expanding scope of operations in Africa were raised this month when it was revealed that the United States had carried out four airstrikes in Libya between September and January that Africa Command did not disclose at the time. The military has said it will acknowledge such missions if asked about them, even if it does not affirmatively disclose them in a news release.Ms. Mack said that Saturday’s attack was the first airstrike the United States had conducted against Al Qaeda in Libya. In fact, the United States conducted an airstrike in eastern Libya in June 2015 against Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the mastermind of the 2013 terrorist seizure of an Algerian gas plant that left 38 foreign hostages dead. Mr. Belmokhtar was a longtime Qaeda operative with ties to senior Qaeda leadership in Pakistan. Western intelligence officials today remain divided over whether he is dead.American efforts to hunt down Islamists in Libya’s vast deserts rely heavily on surveillance and airpower but also on alliances with the armed groups vying for control of Libya. Mohamed El Sallak, a spokesman for the United Nations-backed unity government, said on Twitter that the attack in Ubari on Saturday was part of the “strategic cooperation between Libya and the United States in the fight against terrorism.”But in Ubari, armed Tebu and Tuareg groups have sided with different sides in Libya’s chaotic struggle, and the unity government is by no means the dominant player.Some control a stretch of southern border, while others have allied with militias from the coastal cities of Misurata and Benghazi. The rising force now in the south is Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter, the commander of the Libyan National Army based in Benghazi.Since his forces ousted the last Islamist militias from Benghazi in December, Mr. Hifter has focused on the south, where he exerts influence through his fleet of aging warplanes and alliances with local armed groups.In Sebha, the largest southern city, Mr. Hifter and the rival United Nations-backed government are vying for control through local proxies. In Ubari, 110 miles to the west, Mr. Hifter has allied with an ethnically mixed militia that is composed of former Qaddafi loyalists and more recent recruits.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/us/politics/guns-midterms-republicans.html","The passionate gun-control rallies that brought out large crowds around the country over the weekend signaled that gun violence is not going away as an issue in the 2018 midterm elections and raised the prospect that Republican candidates might be pushed mainly on the defensive on gun issues for the first time in decades.The gun debate could play out very differently in House and Senate races, as Republicans strain to save suburban congressional districts where gun control is popular and Democrats defend Senate seats in red states where the Second Amendment is sacrosanct.But across the landscape of midterm races, Republican and Democratic leaders say the gun issue appears to have become a potent rallying point for voters opposed to President Trump and fed up with what they see as Washington’s indifference to mass shootings. The scale of demonstrations over the weekend was reminiscent of the Women’s March, earlier in Mr. Trump’s presidency, and underscored the intense energy of activists on the left ahead of the fall campaign.Republicans have already been struggling to keep their footing in densely populated suburbs where Mr. Trump is unpopular and the National Rifle Association is an object of widespread scorn. The gun issue appears likely to deepen Republicans’ problems in these areas, further cleaving moderate, pocketbook-minded suburban voters from the party’s more hard-line rural base and raising the risks for Republicans in swing House districts around the country.But gun control may be a complicated issue for Democrats, too, because of the makeup of the Senate races on the ballot in November. If Democrats have a path to capturing the House through mainly moderate, well-educated districts, they are also defending Senate seats in strongly conservative states, like West Virginia and North Dakota, and in Republican-leaning states like Missouri and Indiana, where pro-gun positions have long been safe political terrain.Still, several prominent Republicans warned on Sunday that the party could end up alienating groups that tend to vote for candidates to the right of center, if they are seen as indifferent to the rising outcry around guns. In an atmosphere of frustration with Washington, inaction on guns could add to voters’ anger at entrenched lawmakers there.Gov. John Kasich, Republican of Ohio, warned in a CNN interview on Sunday that voters “do want changes” on gun policy and Republicans were ignoring them at their peril.“People should absolutely be held accountable at the ballot box,” said Mr. Kasich, a critic of Mr. Trump who is contemplating a run for president in 2020.It is not only the Republican Party’s dwindling moderate wing that sees danger in the gun issue. Dan Eberhart, an energy executive and major conservative donor, said Republicans risked driving away suburban voters if they did not do more to defy the N.R.A.Mr. Eberhart pointed to Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican with an A-plus N.R.A. rating for supporting the organization’s agenda. Mr. Scott, who is contemplating a bid for the Senate seat held by the Democrat Bill Nelson, signed incremental new gun regulations after last month’s shooting in Parkland, Fla., over the N.R.A.’s objections.“Republicans are going to have to move a little to get 51 percent-plus in elections and the N.R.A. will have to deal with it,” Mr. Eberhart said in an email. “The N.R.A. is really out of step with suburban G.O.P. voters.”While Democrats have little hope the demonstrations will lead quickly to legislation, they predict the broad-based outpouring of protest will increase pressure on Republicans.“This wasn’t Democrats only,” Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, said of the protests. “This was people just sick and tired of a ruling party that refuses to take action on something so morally urgent.”Public opinion polls show powerful support for a range of gun measures, with overwhelming support for stricter background checks for gun purchasers and a smaller majority favoring an outright ban on assault-style weapons. A Fox News poll conducted last week found that three in five voters supported a ban on military-style weapons, while about nine in 10 supported universal background checks.But the same poll found scant optimism among voters that Congress would act in accordance with their preferences. While a majority of respondents called it “very” or “extremely” important that Congress pass gun legislation, only about a fifth of voters thought it was highly likely Congress would act.The doubters are probably correct: There is relatively little time left on the congressional calendar this year, and the Republicans who control the House and Senate have shown no great appetite for tackling gun control. The $1.3 trillion spending bill that Mr. Trump signed on Friday included modest school safety measures and improvements to the background-checks system, but it did not include a number of more ambitious and popular measures, like raising the age requirement for purchasers of assault weapons.And while the Justice Department announced last week that it would try to follow through on a promise to ban so-called bump stocks through regulation, Mr. Trump has not indicated that he intends to take any further executive action to address the issue.Against a backdrop of plodding debate in Washington, a number of Democratic candidates in important races have already made prominent appeals to voters on the issue of gun violence, combining support for new gun restrictions with rhetorical denunciations of the N.R.A.Several of the Democrats campaigning most assertively on firearm regulation are also competing in areas recently afflicted by gun massacres. In Nevada, Steve Sisolak, a leading Democratic candidate for governor, vowed in his first television commercial to “take on the N.R.A.” A member of the Clark County Commission, Mr. Sisolak was among the most visible officials responding to the mass shooting in Las Vegas in October, which left 58 people dead and hundreds wounded.In Colorado, Mike Johnston, a state senator who helped enact new gun restrictions after the 2012 Aurora, Colo., movie theater massacre, also made guns the centerpiece of his first commercial. Citing his record after Aurora, Mr. Johnston pledged to “ban military-style weapons” and “stop the gun lobby.”Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democratic congressional candidate in South Florida, in a district not far from Parkland, said voters were fired up both because of their horror at mass shootings and their outrage at congressional inaction.“This is a symbol of everything that is wrong right now, that is happening in Washington, D.C.,” said Ms. Mucarsel-Powell, who is challenging Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Miami Republican.Ms. Mucarsel-Powell, who marched on Saturday in a rally against gun violence in Key West, has aired television commercials describing her personal experience with gun violence: When she was 24, her father was shot and killed in Ecuador.Other Democrats have been more timid on gun issues, particularly in more rural and heavily white, working-class districts where broad gun rights are more popular. When Democrats won an upset victory in a Pennsylvania special election  this month, in a heavily conservative congressional district outside Pittsburgh, they did so by nominating a distinctly moderate candidate, Conor Lamb, who declined to back any new gun regulations after the Parkland massacre.Val DiGiorgio, the chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, said that while Democrats won that special election, the race had shown “the passion of Second Amendment supporters.” But Mr. DiGiorgio said voters were plainly looking for remedies to the problem of gun violence.“It’s clear that Americans on all sides of the debate are looking for solutions,” Mr. DiGiorgio said.But the energy in the base of the Democratic Party is with those who favor gun restrictions.While the colorful signs and pleading speeches of the students drew attention on Saturday, state and local Democratic parties across the country also used the marches to register voters and sign up volunteers.In Florida, volunteers circulated at protests in over 30 cities, passing out “commit to vote” cards that the party can later use for voter turnout purposes. And in Virginia, Democrats descended on the cities where buses were departing to the Washington march to register voters.The efforts were not just confined to large liberal and swing states. In Columbia, S.C., the local Democratic Party used the march in the state’s capital to sign up voters for what could be a competitive governor’s race there this fall.The liberal group Indivisible also took advantage of the protests to kick off its congressional recess lobbying efforts, distributing kits nationally that included potential town hall questions and forms activists could use to contact lawmakers.For Republicans, the worst fear may be that the marches over the weekend indicate an emerging coalition, on gun issues and more, between Democrats who favor liberal policies across the board, and moderate swing voters who strongly oppose Mr. Trump and much of his party’s cultural agenda.Jim Hobart, a Republican pollster, said the gun control marches illustrated the enormous energy of the Democratic base and could be a symptom of generational changes in the electorate that Republicans will have to grapple with.“As we have seen in special elections, Democratic enthusiasm is already very high and the gun issue just adds to that,” Mr. Hobart said, noting that students in his hometown Atlanta had traveled by bus for 10 hours to join the march in Washington. “These same students are much more likely to not just vote, but volunteer.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/fashion/weddings/a-merger-for-the-rabbi-and-the-labor-leader.html","Randi Weingarten and Rabbi Sharon Anne Kleinbaum are to be married March 25 at La Marina, a restaurant in New York. Judge Michelle Schreiber of the New York City Housing Court, is to officiate, with Rabbi Sharon Cohen Anisfeld, the president of Hebrew College, leading the religious ceremony, which will include the signing of the ketubah.Ms. Weingarten (left), 60, is the president of the American Federation of Teachers, which has headquarters in Washington. She graduated from Cornell and received a law degree from Cardozo School of Law, Yeshiva University.She is the daughter of Gabriel Weingarten of Suffern, N.Y., and the late Edith Appelbaum Weingarten.Rabbi Kleinbaum, 58, is the senior rabbi of Congregation Beth Simhat Torah in New York, a synagogue with a significant number of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender congregants. She graduated from Barnard College and from Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Wyncott, Pa.She is the daughter of Josephine Leve Kleinbaum of Teaneck, N.J., and the late Max M. Kleinbaum.In the mid-1990s, Rabbi Kleinbaum and Ms. Weingarten knew each other peripherally.“We were two lesbians in New York fighting for different things,” Ms. Weingarten said. “We liked each other. We had good banter. It wasn’t as if there were a lot of high-profile gay women who were active in leadership roles. I thought she was fun, witty and smart.”It continued that way until 2006. Both were at the Empire State Pride Agenda dinner, when Rabbi Kleinbaum asked Ms. Weingarten to speak at the Gay Pride Shabbat service.“I’d just turned 50, I’d never publicly come out and said, ‘I’m a lesbian,’” Ms. Weingarten said. “Sharon allowed me to see myself as who I was. It shifted my thinking that it wasn’t simply about having a gay pride speaker. It was about shifting me. I was very moved by it.”Rabbi Kleinbaum recalls the “ask” a little differently.“She’s one of the most significant labor leaders in America,” Rabbi Kleinbaum said. “I didn’t get how dramatic it would be for her. I just thought it would be an amazing coup if she said yes.”Years went by. They continued to see into each other sporadically until 2012. While Ms. Weingarten was working in Washington and dating, Rabbi Kleinbaum was in New York getting divorced after an 18-year relationship.“I’d heard Sharon was single, so I emailed her asking if she wanted to have lunch,” Ms. Weingarten said.Rabbi Kleinbaum wrote back the following day. But it was not an easy time in her life.“My whole world was falling apart,” she said. “It was such a difficult time for me. I was carrying the load of a full-time position. I had two daughters. I wasn’t thinking about anyone in that way.”Eight or nine email exchanges later, lunch got parlayed into dinner and a friendly request grew into an actual date.“Flirt entered into the emails,” Ms. Weingarten said. “I was really excited about it. But I almost screwed the whole thing up. I got invited to the state dinner by President Obama for David Cameron.”It was a plus-one invitation. “I asked Sharon if she would be willing to have our date at the White House rather than in New York,” Ms. Weingarten said.Rabbi Kleinbaum immediately declined.“I would never go to the state dinner as a first date,” Rabbi Kleinbaum said. “I’m interested in intimacy. Everyone would think we were on a date. I started wondering if I was ready for that. I wasn’t even sure I wanted to be in a relationship again. I wanted to take things slow.”So they did. Ms. Weingarten attended the dinner with a colleague. The next day she and Rabbi Kleinbaum went for Indian food in the West Village. They talked all night.“There was no political-speak,” Ms. Weingarten said. “We talked about our lives and things that were important to us. It was a fantastic first date. I didn’t want the night to end.”That same year, Rabbi Kleinbaum moved into an apartment in the Inwood section of Manhattan. Ms. Weingarten commuted back and forth from Washington, spending two nights there, two nights in New York and other days traveling for work.“My life had been turned upside down,” Rabbi Kleinbaum said. “Here I was in my 50s with my dogs, and all I had was a mattress on the floor. But Randi never seemed uncomfortable. I thought, this is an incredibly kind person. I value kindness. Slowly I got furniture.”As her apartment grew, so did their relationship.In 2014, they began looking for an apartment together. Three years later they found one. Their proposal and engagement almost took as long. When Obergefell v. Hodges was decided in 2015, an excited Ms. Weingarten asked if the decision meant they could get married. Rabbi Kleinbaum wanted to wait.“We’re not spring chickens,” Rabbi Kleinbaum said. “We didn’t believe we would get this kind of love this late in our lives.”In June 2017, they both agreed it was time.“We have a deepening relationship,” Rabbi Kleinbaum said. “We’re both astounded we found each other and both astounded we’re making it work. If you live long enough, life is full of surprises.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/march-for-guns-rallies.html","SALT LAKE CITY — Dallas Johnson, 18, stood at the top of a hill here on Saturday, flanked by men with pistols and children gripping protest signs.He held a pole, and a giant flag flapped above him, bearing a rifle and a message in black: “Come and take it.”Hundreds of thousands of people marched in cities on Saturday calling on officials to enact stricter gun laws, but they were not the only ones to demonstrate.Across the country, supporters of the Second Amendment gathered at state capitals and in city centers, hoping to counter the swell that has emerged in the wake of a February massacre that killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla. Their message in many cases was that the surviving Parkland students have it all wrong — more guns, not fewer, is what will end the violence that has ripped through so many American communities.“What can we do to stop mass shootings?” said one of the many signs at the rally here. “SHOOT BACK.”In Montana, more than 100 supporters of gun rights gathered at the state Capitol in Helena, where several children held a placard declaring students in gun-free zones to be “sitting ducks.” In Arizona, Second Amendment proponents carried rifles through Phoenix, sometimes clashing with other protesters. In Salt Lake City, the rally drew 500 participants, according to an estimate by the police.In Boston, where Second Amendment supporters gathered in front of the Statehouse, the organizer Paul Allen, 62, a retired construction worker, described supporters of gun control as “ignorant sheep who are being spoon-fed by liberal teachers.”“They haven’t read the Constitution,” he said, “and they don’t know what it means.”In Utah, the rally for gun rights began outside a high school with a prayer, “The Star-Spangled Banner” and shouts of “Long live freedom!”In one corner stood Brandon McKee, 46, with a firearm on his belt and his 11-year-old daughter, Kendall, by his side. Kendall wore braces and a hat that said “unicorn” across the band.“I’m tired of sitting on the sidelines,” said Mr. McKee, who works as a delivery man for a local school district. “The other side is passionate and they are well organized. And it’s time that we stand up for our rights before they get taken away.”He explained why he carries his gun at all times.“When emergencies happen, cops are minutes away when seconds count,” he said. “I can’t depend on anybody else to defend me or my family.”The march set off down a wide avenue, but tensions erupted almost immediately as a single infiltrator — Linda Peer, 67, from Torrey, Utah — took to the front of the line, holding a sign calling for stricter gun laws.The pro-gun group heckled her.“She’s not a true American!” yelled a man in an orange jacket. “Shame on you!” the group chanted as she darted between protesters with her sign. “Shame on you! Shame on you!”The marchers passed several Mormon Church buildings, with the man in orange still heckling her, and then climbed a hill to the Capitol, where they ascended a series of white steps.A man in camouflage turned his attention to a woman on the steps who appeared to be part of a gun control group.“You don’t even know what you’re talking about,” he shouted at her. “Are you even from this country?”The counterprotest in Salt Lake City was organized by Bryan Melchior, co-owner of the Utah Gun Exchange, a website that sells firearms.Mr. Melchior said he recently had met many young people who felt that the growing call for stricter gun laws did not represent their views.Among them was Cody Frandsen, 17, a high school senior wearing a “Make America Great Again” baseball cap. “I feel like an outsider,” said Mr. Frandsen, standing with friends who nodded in agreement. “A lot of the millennials, our age group, is left-leaning.”The group began talking about gun laws it might be able to support.“I’m totally for a background check,” said Mr. Frandsen, noting that he supported universal checks.“I think there should be a mental health check” before purchasing a gun, said his friend Logan Coffey, 17. “And the government should know where every single firearm is.”Of those who marched in Washington in support of gun control, Mr. Frandsen said he did not agree with anything “they have to say,” adding, “But I’m sure we could come up with some kind of compromise.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/jared-kushner-mexico.html","WASHINGTON — When President Trump complained that the $1.3 trillion spending bill he grudgingly signed on Friday did not pay for his border wall, he kept alive an issue that has poisoned relations between the United States and Mexico from the day he took office.And yet, for Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, it was a small step in the right direction.Mr. Trump did not repeat his demand that Mexico must pay for the wall. Mr. Kushner, people who work with him say, has asked the president to refrain from using that line. He also lobbied Mr. Trump to exempt the country from new steel and aluminum tariffs, and to renegotiate, rather than rip up, the North American Free Trade Agreement.The well-meaning interventions of Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka, with Mr. Trump are a familiar — and to some critics, overblown — theme of this administration. Their influence has been questioned ever since Mr. Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accord last year over their objections.But on the issue of Mexico, allies of Mr. Kushner and Mexican government officials say he has worked behind the scenes, with some success, to preserve a relationship that has been corroded by Mr. Trump’s bitter clashes with President Enrique Peña Nieto over the wall.Next week, during a visit to Mexico by the secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, the two countries will sign the first two of about two dozen agreements that are the fruits of Mr. Kushner’s personal diplomacy with Mexico’s foreign minister, Luis Videgaray.The agreements — one that creates joint inspections to stop the flow of drugs and other contraband across the border; another that uses technology to speed up the inspections of legal cargo — are much less visible than either the wall or the disputed provisions in Nafta.But they show that Mexico and the United States can still work together. White House officials said that in the coming weeks, the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies would announce more agreements on energy cooperation, infrastructure and economic development in Central American countries, aiming at stemming the flow of migrants, through Mexico, into the United States.“It’s true — Jared has been a positive influence,” said Gerónimo Gutiérrez, Mexico’s ambassador to Washington. “Our dialogue is not limited to the White House. However, if we didn’t have that dialogue with Mr. Kushner, the relationship would be much worse off.”For Mr. Kushner, progress on Mexico would be a bright spot in what has been a difficult stretch. He was recently stripped of his top-secret security clearance and faces a hostile reception from Palestinians to his Middle East peace plan after Mr. Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. His future in the White House is regularly scrutinized, though he has told colleagues he is not going anywhere.Mr. Kushner’s aides acknowledge his work could be overshadowed by a breakdown in talks over Nafta. The two countries are in the final stages of negotiations, with officials from both sides putting the odds of a deal at no better than 50-50. Then there is the relationship between Mr. Trump and Mr. Peña Nieto, which has fallen apart twice during angry telephone exchanges over who should pay for the wall.This month, Mr. Trump dispatched Mr. Kushner to Mexico City to mend fences with Mr. Peña Nieto after their latest clash prompted the Mexican leader to cancel a visit to Washington. The Mexican news media harshly criticized Mr. Peña Nieto for receiving Mr. Kushner, a sign of just how toxic the Trump name has become there.“I give both of them credit for doing it,” said Jorge Guajardo, a Mexican diplomat who served as his country’s ambassador to China. “In very adverse circumstances, Jared is working to keep things going.”Still, Mr. Guajardo noted that Mexico had long worked with the United States on projects related to the border. These agreements, however useful, cannot repair the damage done by Mr. Trump’s inflammatory words about Mexicans crossing the border or his demands that Mexico underwrite the wall.“We’ve been doing it for a long time, without all the acrimony, without all the attacks, without the president saying that Mexicans are terrible people,” Mr. Guajardo said.At the heart of Mr. Kushner’s involvement with Mexico is the relationship he has cultivated with Mr. Videgaray, a close adviser to Mr. Peña Nieto who, as finance minister, brokered Mr. Trump’s visit to Mexico City during the 2016 presidential campaign.Mr. Kushner was thrilled with that visit, particularly since campaign officials feared it could turn into a public-relations disaster for their candidate. It went less well for Mr. Videgaray, who was forced to resign after the Mexican news media savaged the meeting and his role in arranging it. (He later returned as foreign minister.)Mr. Kushner and Mr. Videgaray got to know each other during the transition and have talked regularly since. During Mr. Trump’s first phone call with Mr. Peña Nieto, the two leaders had a rancorous exchange over trade and the wall but agreed that Mr. Kushner and Mr. Videgaray should draft a statement putting a positive spin on their conversation, according to a transcript that was leaked to The Washington Post.Mr. Trump’s decision to hand the Mexico portfolio to Mr. Kushner generated tension with the secretary of state at the time, Rex W. Tillerson, who objected to the president’s 37-year-old son-in-law taking on what he saw as his duties. On his most recent trip to Mexico, Mr. Kushner raised more hackles in the State Department by excluding the American ambassador, Roberta S. Jacobson, from his meeting with the president.Mr. Kushner, aides said, wanted to have a more intimate meeting and besides, they noted, Ms. Jacobson, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, is stepping down. He did include Kimberly Breier, a State Department official recently nominated as assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs.Given Mr. Tillerson’s dismissal and the C.I.A. director, Mike Pompeo, who has been nominated to replace him, Mr. Kushner will have to contend with a forceful new player in the diplomatic ranks. But his biggest hurdle to improved relations between Mexico and the United States may be the political calendar in both countries.Mexicans will vote for a new president on July 1, likely removing Mr. Kushner’s friend, Mr. Videgaray, from office. Americans will vote in midterm elections in the fall — the pressure of which, analysts said, could lead Mr. Trump to revive the disparaging language about Mexico that first necessitated Mr. Kushner’s diplomatic rescue mission.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/style/stormy-daniels.html","One by one, the honorees came forward to be recognized: the wounded veteran, the tech executive and the noted porn star.It was the 10-year reunion for Scotlandville Magnet High School’s Class of 1997 in Baton Rouge, La., and a few alumni were being singled out for professional distinction. Stephanie Clifford needed no reintroduction. “Everybody already knew,” she said of her career in an interview. She worked the room of suits and gowns with a smile.By now, the public knows both too much about Ms. Clifford, who goes by Stormy Daniels, and almost nothing at all.She is the actress in pornographic films who is suing a sitting president, with whom she said she had a consensual affair, in order to be released from a nondisclosure agreement she reached with his lawyer just before the 2016 election. Over the past two months, she has guided the story of her alleged relationship with President Trump — and the $130,000 she was paid to keep silent — into a full-fledged scandal. If Ms. Clifford’s court case proceeds, Mr. Trump may have to testify in depositions, and her suit could provide evidence of campaign spending violations. She is scheduled to appear on “60 Minutes” on Sunday.And if her name has seemed ubiquitous — repeated on cable television and in the White House briefing room, and plastered on signs outside nightclubs, where her appearance fees have multiplied — there is this to consider: Unlike most perceived presidential adversaries, about whom Mr. Trump is rarely shy, Ms. Clifford has not been the subject of a single tweet.To many in the capital, Ms. Clifford, 39, has become an unexpected force. It is she, some in Washington now joke, and not the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who could topple Mr. Trump.Those who know her well have registered the moment differently. Ms. Clifford has subsisted amid the seamier elements of a business often rife with exploitation and unruly fare; more than a few of her film titles are unprintable. But for most of her professional life, Ms. Clifford has been a woman in control of her own narrative in a field where that can be uncommon. With an instinct for self-promotion, she evolved from “kindergarten circuit” stripper to star actress and director, and occasional mainstream success, by her late 20s. Why would a piece of paper and an executive legal team set her back?[ALSO READ: Stormy Daniels Offers to Return Payment to End Deal for Her Silence]“She’s the boss, and everyone knew it,” Nina Hartley, one of the longest-working performers in the industry, said about Ms. Clifford.“The Renaissance porn star,” said Ron Jeremy, once perhaps the most famous porn star of all.“She was a very serious businesswoman and a filmmaker and had taken the reins of her career,” said Judd Apatow, who directed her cameos in the R-rated comedies “Knocked Up” and “The 40-Year-Old Virgin.” “She is not someone to be underestimated.”In her own scripts, she has gravitated at times toward more ambitious productions, with elaborate plotlines and nods to politics.Her standards on set can be exacting. Ms. Clifford does not mind firing people, colleagues said, banishing those who flub a scene or gild a résumé. She has demanded that an actor change his “dumb” stage name because it would look silly on her promotional materials. And she has coaxed singular performances from her charges, once guiding Mr. Jeremy through a scene in which he sang to her small dog.Her competitive streak is not well concealed. After industry award nominations were announced one year, Ms. Clifford, who had amassed more than a dozen such honors, reminded an interviewer that she had been snubbed in the categories of cinematography and editing.When opportunities have presented themselves outside her domain — a Maroon 5 music video, a public flirtation with a Senate run in Louisiana, an appearance at a celebrity golf tournament that included a future president — Ms. Clifford has made the most of the publicity, helping her carve out a comfortable life in the Dallas suburbs.She has a daughter, a third husband and an expensive hobby: equestrian shows. “She blends right in,” said Packy McGaughan, a trainer on the competition circuit. “A pretty girl riding a horse.”[ALSO READ: Ex-Playboy Model Karen McDougal Details 10-Month Affair With Donald Trump]More recently, inconspicuousness has been elusive in her life, but that is largely by design. Ms. Clifford has leveraged her newfound crossover fame into a national stripping tour, with scheduled dates through the end of the year. Not everyone is interested in attending.“Pretty sure dumb whores go to hell,” someone wrote her on Twitter last week.“Whew!” Ms. Clifford replied. “Glad I’m a smart one.”Becoming StormyClassmates remember her as a serious, unobtrusive student — a natural fit at a competitive, racially diverse high school with an engineering focus. They knew her as Stephanie Gregory, the girl with the auburn hair. She liked horses and Mötley Crüe.A quote beneath her senior yearbook photo hinted at high aspirations: “We will all get along just fine,” it read, “as soon as you realize that I am Queen.”She thought she might be a veterinarian, or maybe a writer. “At first I thought I wanted to be a journalist,” Ms. Clifford said by phone on Friday in a 12-minute interview about her background.Her parents, Sheila and Bill Gregory, divorced when she was about 4, leaving her largely in the care of her mother. She has not seen either parent in over a decade. Ms. Clifford, who later took her first husband’s surname, came from a “really bad neighborhood,” she said. She strained to remember exactly what she was like then.“I don’t really know because I’m such a different person now,” she said. “I wasn’t like the popular girl, and I wasn’t the jock, and I wasn’t the ditz. I don’t know. I was just sort of in the middle of the road.”She had offers from colleges, she has said. She had the test scores. The dancing started on a lark, of sorts. She was 17 and visiting a friend at a strip club in town, when she was persuaded to perform a “guest set.”“I remember going on stage and thinking I was going to be a lot more afraid than I was,” Ms. Clifford said. “It was a slow night. There were like three people in the club, and I made enough money on two songs to make more than I did all week answering phones at the riding stable that I worked at.”After high school, she found a professional home at the Gold Club in Baton Rouge, ingratiating herself with management as a reliable and magnetic performer, slogging through shifts from 3 p.m. to 2 a.m. to earn perhaps a few hundred dollars a night.A calendar from 1999, in which Ms. Clifford straddles a Harley-Davidson as the dancer for July, still sits in the club, now called the Penthouse Club Baton Rouge.“We knew,” said Chuck Rolling, who has long overseen operations there. “She was moving in a direction that was bigger than us. We’re in Baton Rouge. We’re not even New Orleans.”Ms. Clifford eventually graduated to higher-profile dancing work, traveling across Texas and Louisiana to headline at strip clubs, before transitioning to pornography. She was both determined to bend the business to her will and conflicted about the long-term consequences. “I have very mixed emotions about stripping because stripping got me where I am now,” she said, at age 23, in an industry interview. “I own my own house, I own my own car, I own my own business. My credit is excellent. I have nice furniture and nice things.”Still, the risks were clear. “I have just seen so many girls that it just ruins them,” she said then, “so many women who are 35, 40 years old and still stripping and have nothing to show for it, and that is just really sad.”Ms. Clifford chose a more tempestuous stage name than most peers. She was not an Angel, or a Summer, or a Destiny. She was Stormy. And she was blond now.Often, she kept to herself. Mike South, a director and columnist in the industry press, recalled encountering her in 2004, the year she was named “best new starlet” at the Adult Video News Awards, pornography’s equivalent of the Oscars. “She was sitting in the lobby, alone, and I just decided to be friendly,” said Mr. South, who invited her to a group dinner. “She looks at me and doesn’t crack a smile — expressionless — and says, ‘I am really not that friendly.’”Recognition came quickly anyway: awards, magazine spreads, feature roles and a contract with Wicked Pictures, a prominent pornography company. When she needed to, she charmed industry gatekeepers with a disarming wit.“Are those real?” read a question posted on her website.“Well,” she said, “you’re certainly not imagining them.”In 2008, as Jenna Jameson, then the industry’s reigning monarch, announced her retirement at an awards show — “I will never spread my legs in this industry again,” she told the crowd — Ms. Clifford seemed to position herself next in line.“I love you, Jenna,” Ms. Clifford said, accepting an award from Ms. Jameson moments later, “but I’m going to spread my legs a little longer.”Other HorizonsIt was a striking political slogan: “Screwing People Honestly.” But subtlety was never the idea.In 2009, well into her turn as a director, Ms. Clifford sensed an opening beyond her typical orbit. David Vitter, a United States senator in her home state of Louisiana, was staggering toward a re-election year, laid low by a prostitution scandal. Ms. Clifford declared herself a Republican (though a Democratic operative was said to be involved in her efforts) and courted wide-scale media attention as she publicly weighed the merits of running. In remarks at the time, she connected her professional journey to the lives of service workers across the state.“Just as these misguided arbiters of the mainstream view an adult entertainment star as an anathema to the political process,” she said, when she eventually decided against a bid, “so too do they view the dishwasher, the cashier or the bus driver.”The false-start campaign coincided with a turbulent moment in her personal life, exposing her to scrutiny in the mainstream press. In July 2009, Ms. Clifford was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of domestic violence after hitting her husband, a performer in the industry, and throwing a potted plant during a fight about laundry and unpaid bills, according to police records. The husband, Michael Mosny, was not injured, and the charge was later dropped. Ms. Clifford had previously been married to another pornographic actor.She has since married another colleague in the business, Brendon Miller, the father of her now 7-year-old daughter. He is also a drummer and has composed music for her films. The family has been spotted often at equestrian events, where Ms. Clifford, the owner of several horses, has captured blue ribbons. Her preparations can be meticulous, matching her saddle pad with a horse’s bonnet colors.“She takes it very personally that she does well,” said Dominic Schramm, a horse trainer and rider who has worked with her for several years. “She can be quite hard on herself.”Ms. Clifford has not shown up at competitions since news broke in January that she accepted a financial settlement in October 2016 — weeks before the election — agreeing to keep quiet about her alleged intimate relationship with Mr. Trump. She has said the affair, which representatives of Mr. Trump have denied, began in 2006 and extended into 2007, the year she married Mr. Mosny.Earlier this month, she escalated public attention by filing suit, calling the 2016 contract meaningless given that Mr. Trump had never signed it and revealing that the president’s personal lawyer had taken further secret legal action to keep her silent this year.She has said that she does not want to expose the equestrian world — or her daughter — to the attendant circus trailing her now.But the show has gone on for Ms. Clifford. She has danced across the country in recent months, from Las Vegas to Long Island. There are many more appearances to come. It would be foolish, she has said, to turn down more money than usual for the same work.“She likes to maximize her profits,” said Danny Capozzi, an agent who manages her bookings, “not only on the feature dance bookings but at all times.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/transgender-title-vii.html","WASHINGTON — Employers are moving to adopt or strengthen policies to prevent bias against transgender people after the latest in a series of court rulings that have extended protections for an increasingly diverse work force.A federal appeals court, rejecting the position of the Trump administration, ruled this month that transgender people are protected by a civil rights law that bans workplace discrimination based on sex.Lawyers who specialize in employment cases said that the decision, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, was highly significant. The court held that job discrimination on the basis of transgender status was inherently sex discrimination, and that the employer in this case could not claim an exemption from the law because of his religious beliefs.The case was brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an independent federal agency, on behalf of a funeral director who had been fired by a Michigan funeral home after informing the owner that she intended to transition from male to female and would dress as a woman while at work.Job discrimination based on a person’s transgender status violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the court ruled. Under the law, it said, “gender must be irrelevant to employment decisions.”The court’s conclusion is at odds with a position taken by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in October. In a memorandum to Justice Department lawyers, he said that “Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination encompasses discrimination between men and women but does not encompass discrimination based on gender identity per se, including transgender status.”The funeral home maintained that it did not violate federal law by requiring the employee to comply with a sex-specific dress code. Moreover, the owner of the home, Thomas Rost, who has been a Christian for more than 65 years, said that forcing him to employ the transgender worker would impose a substantial burden on his sincerely held religious beliefs and would therefore violate another law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.The court disagreed, saying that employees may not be discriminated against because they fail to conform to “stereotypical gender norms” — in this case, an employer’s notion of “how biologically male persons should dress, appear, behave and identify.”Discrimination based on transgender status is a form of sex discrimination, said the decision, written by Judge Karen Nelson Moore for a unanimous three-judge panel, because “an employer cannot discriminate against an employee for being transgender without considering that employee’s biological sex.”Scott Rabe, an expert on employment law at the firm Seyfarth Shaw, said that the ruling was important because “it addresses two hot-button topics in employment law: the scope of the definition of ‘sex discrimination’ under Title VII and the impact of laws protecting the free exercise of religion in the workplace.”“The ruling is a big win for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and for transgender people,” Mr. Rabe said. “The court sent a strong message that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act has minimal impact on the E.E.O.C.’s authority to enforce the anti-discrimination laws under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.”In an interview, the employee at the center of the case, Aimee Stephens, 57, said she had been shocked by her dismissal.“I had a hard time believing that a company or a person could get away with firing me because I was transgender,” Ms. Stephens said. “It didn’t seem right.” But, she said, she has since learned that “it’s a pretty common occurrence for transgender people to be fired because they are transgender or don’t meet the expectations of what another individual thinks they should be.’’In court papers, Mr. Rost said he wanted to run his business in keeping with his religious belief that “a person’s sex (whether male or female) is an immutable God-given gift and that people should not deny or attempt to change their sex.”The court decision is binding in states covered by the Sixth Circuit: Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. But its reasoning could have influence elsewhere.As it embraced a broad view of protections under Title VII, the court also rejected an expansive interpretation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.That law figured prominently in dozens of court cases in which employers challenged an Obama-era rule that required them to provide insurance coverage for contraception under the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration has proposed to roll back that requirement by offering an exemption to any employer that objects to covering birth control on the basis of religious beliefs.Doron M. Kalir, a law professor at Cleveland State University in Ohio, said the court ruling showed how judges were “extending the protection of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to a more diverse work force of gays, lesbians and transgender people.”The funeral home has not said whether it will appeal the ruling. Mr. Kalir said that at least several Supreme Court justices, if presented with the issue, would probably vote to overturn the ruling on the ground that Congress was not thinking about transgender people when it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. (Mr. Kalir wrote a friend-of-the-court brief for a civil rights group, Equality Ohio, that was quoted by the appeals court.)In a separate case last year, Judge Richard A. Posner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, said the meaning of the civil rights law and the word “sex” had changed over the years.“It is well-nigh certain that homosexuality, male or female, did not figure in the minds of the legislators who enacted Title VII,” wrote Judge Posner, who retired from the federal bench in September. But, he said, the law “invites an interpretation that will update it to the present,” and the word “sex” in Title VII can now, after more than a half-century, be “understood to include homosexuality.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/unlock-phones-encryption.html","WASHINGTON — Federal law enforcement officials are renewing a push for a legal mandate that tech companies build tools into smartphones and other devices that would allow access to encrypted data in criminal investigations.F.B.I. and Justice Department officials have been quietly meeting with security researchers who have been working on approaches to provide such “extraordinary access” to encrypted devices, according to people familiar with the talks.Based on that research, Justice Department officials are convinced that mechanisms allowing access to the data can be engineered without intolerably weakening the devices’ security against hacking.Against that backdrop, law enforcement officials have revived talks inside the executive branch over whether to ask Congress to enact legislation mandating the access mechanisms. The Trump White House circulated a memo last month among security and economic agencies outlining ways to think about solving the problem, officials said.The F.B.I. has been agitating for versions of such a mandate since 2010, complaining that the spreading use of encryption is eroding investigators’ ability to carry out wiretap orders and search warrants — a problem it calls “going dark.”The issue repeatedly flared without resolution under the Obama administration, peaking in 2016, when the government tried to force Apple to help it break into the iPhone of one of the attackers in the terrorist assault in San Bernardino, Calif.The debate receded when the Trump administration took office, but in recent months top officials like Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, and Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, have begun talking publicly about the “going dark” problem.The National Security Council and the Justice Department declined to comment about the internal deliberations. The people familiar with the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioning that they were at a preliminary stage and that no request for legislation was imminent.But the renewed push is certain to be met with resistance.“Building an exceptional access system is a complicated engineering problem with many parts that all have to work perfectly in order for it to be secure, and no one has a solution to it,” said Susan Landau, a Tufts University computer security professor. “Any of the options people are talking about now would heighten the danger that your phone or your laptop could be hacked and data taken off of it.”Craig Federighi, the senior vice president of software engineering at Apple, stressed the importance of strengthening — not weakening — security protections for products like the iPhone, saying threats to data security were increasing every day and arguing that it was a question of “security versus security” rather than security versus privacy.“Proposals that involve giving the keys to customers’ device data to anyone but the customer inject new and dangerous weaknesses into product security,” he said in a statement. “Weakening security makes no sense when you consider that customers rely on our products to keep their personal information safe, run their businesses or even manage vital infrastructure like power grids and transportation systems.”But some computer security researchers believe the problem might be solvable with an acceptable level of new risks.A National Academy of Sciences committee completed an 18-month study of the encryption debate, publishing a report last month. While it largely described challenges to solving the problem, one section cited presentations by several technologists who are developing potential approaches.They included Ray Ozzie, a former chief software architect at Microsoft; Stefan Savage, a computer science professor at the University of California, San Diego; and Ernie Brickell, a former chief security officer at Intel.According to several people familiar with the new round of deliberations, those three men have been participating in a series of workshops convened at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by Daniel Weitzner, a computer science professor. They have discussed their research with government officials, including Valerie Cofield, a senior F.B.I. science and technology official working on “going dark” issues.The researchers, Mr. Ozzie said, recognized that “this issue is not going away,” and were trying to foster “constructive dialogue” rather than declaring that no solution is possible.Mr. Savage said the talks had focused on trying to create a safe enough way to unlock data on encrypted devices, as opposed to the separate matter of decoding intercepted messages sent via encrypted communications services, like Signal and WhatsApp.“The stuff I’ve been thinking about is entirely the device problem,” he said. “I think that is where the action is. Data in motion and the cloud are much harder to deal with.”The deliberations shed new light on public remarks by Trump administration officials in recent months. In October, Mr. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, argued in a speech that permitting technology companies to create “warrant-proof encryption” was endangering society.“Technology companies almost certainly will not develop responsible encryption if left to their own devices,” he said. “Competition will fuel a mind-set that leads them to produce products that are more and more impregnable. That will give criminals and terrorists more opportunities to cause harm with impunity.”And Mr. Wray, the F.B.I. director, has twice given speeches this year in which he pointed to Symphony, an encrypted messaging system for banks. Pushed by a state regulator, several banks agreed to give copies of their Symphony keys to law firms. Because Symphony keeps a copy of encrypted data on its servers, that arrangement created a backup means for investigators to gain access to the messages if necessary.“At the end, the data in Symphony was still secure, still encrypted, but also accessible to the regulators so they could do their jobs,” Mr. Wray told a cybersecurity conference in Boston this month. “I’m confident that by working together and finding similar areas to agree and compromise, we can come up with solutions to the ‘going dark’ problem.”The Symphony approach, however, would not work for millions of ordinary smartphone users. But one alternative being worked on by Mr. Ozzie and others is receiving particular attention inside the government.The idea is that when devices encrypt themselves, they would generate a special access key that could unlock their data without the owner’s passcode. This electronic key would be stored on the device itself, inside part of its hard drive that would be separately encrypted — so that only the manufacturer, in response to a court order, could open it.Law enforcement officials see that idea as attractive in part because companies like Apple are already trusted to securely hold special keys permitting them to push operating system updates to devices like iPhones.Still, Ms. Landau argued that creating such a system would create significant additional security risks. She noted, among other things, that updates are relatively rare but police would want seized phones opened every day — so many more tech company employees would need access to the powerful new keys, increasing the risk of theft or abuse.The Obama administration never agreed on asking for legislation mandating access mechanisms. Military and cybersecurity agencies worried that weakening security would create new problems, and commerce officials worried about quashing innovation and making American tech products less competitive.Still, in 2016, the Obama administration’s deliberations also came to focus on the idea of access keys on devices, a participant said, but stalled because of difficult technical questions about the details. They included how to prevent criminals from deleting the access keys on their devices or from using phones that do not have the mechanism because they run on outdated software or were built for foreign markets.But one Justice Department official familiar with the deliberations contended that it might not be necessary to come up with a foolproof system, arguing that a solution that would work for ordinary, less-savvy criminals was still worth pursuing.Mr. Brickell, the former Intel official, echoed that view. Enforcing compliance with a rule that devices must have access mechanisms to function “is a difficult problem,” he said. “Let’s keep working on it. But let’s not let the desire for a perfect solution get in the way of one that would help.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/us/politics/fact-check-military-pay-immigrants.html","WASHINGTON — As President Trump prepared on Friday to sign a $1.3 trillion spending bill, just hours after threatening to veto it, he offered a few misleading and selectively worded claims to explain why he was reluctantly authorizing the legislation.“We looked at the veto. I looked very seriously at the veto. I was thinking about doing the veto,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. “But because of the incredible gains that we’ve been able to make for the military, that overrode any of our — any of our thinking.”But his explanation did not accurately describe just why those gains were enough to ultimately approve the spending bill. Nor did it correctly demonstrate why the legislation did not include programs that he had prioritized. Here’s a fact-check.“This will be, actually, the largest pay increase for our incredible people in over a decade.” This is imprecise and requires more context.Mr. Trump’s claim, referring to American military personnel, is slightly exaggerated. The spending bill provides a 2.4 percent pay increase for troops, the largest since the 3.4 percent pay increase that was enacted in 2010, according to the Congressional Research Service. That was eight years ago.More important, military pay increases are, by law, tied to the employment cost index, which measures private-sector wages — although the president or Congress can ask for more or less.The Pentagon requested, and Congress enacted, pay increases smaller than the index’s growth rate from 2014 through 2016. But both before and after that time — from 2011 to 2013 and 2017 to 2018 — pay for troops rose at the exact rate as the index grew.Mr. Trump’s proposed budgets for 2017 and 2018 had requested pay increases of 1.6 percent and 2.1 percent — rates that were lower than the statutory formula, and that were ultimately ignored by Congress.“For the last eight years, deep defense cuts have undermined our national security. If you look at what’s taken out, they’ve hallowed our readiness as a military unit and put America at really grave risk.” This needs context. Mr. Trump accurately noted that military officials had expressed concern about degraded troop readiness and delayed modernization of supplies. Both are what officials have described as consequences of protracted combat and budget restrictions, known as sequestration, that were imposed by Congress.It’s worth noting that military spending has decreased in recent years, after the United States withdrew combat troops from Iraq in 2011.Adjusted for inflation, total military spending swelled to more than $774 billion in the 2010 fiscal year from roughly $400 billion in the 2000 fiscal year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That period was the peak of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the wars wound down, so did military spending, which declined to $583 billion by the 2017 fiscal year.War-related spending aside, the Pentagon base budget alone was still larger in 2017 than it was in 2007 or 1997. Over all, the United States spends more on its military than the next seven countries combined.“I can tell you this, and I say this to DACA recipients that the Republicans are with you. They want to get your situation taken care of. The Democrats fought us. They just fought every single inch of the way. They did not want DACA in this bill.” This is misleading. In September, Mr. Trump moved to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, a program began by President Barack Obama that shielded eligible young undocumented immigrants from deportation and gave them the right to work.It is highly misleading to suggest that Democrats “fought” efforts to solidify the program into law. Democratic leaders have rejected Mr. Trump’s demand to pair the program with funding for a border wall, but that is not nearly the same as not wanting a legislative solution at all.Democrats met with Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers in January to discuss a deal, during which Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, suggested a “clean DACA bill.” At the meeting, Mr. Trump agreed.But hours later, the White House said Mr. Trump’s concept of a “clean DACA bill” included border security. Negotiations stalled, and weeks later, Democrats briefly shut down the government over the issue.In February, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, delivered an eight-hour speech about the plight of the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, in a letter dated Feb. 28, said Mr. Trump had “thwarted every bipartisan, narrow agreement that seeks to provide relief for Dreamers” and listed a few examples.And this week, several Democratic lawmakers who voted no on the spending bill said they did so because it did not contain protections for Dreamers.

Trump has tentatively accepted the invitation, amid North Korea’s continued efforts to build a nuclear missile and the United States responding with more economic sanctions.Trump and Kim have exchanged personal insults, with the president calling Kim “Little Rocket Man” and Kim calling Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.”Trump last week announced that he would replace National Security Adviser H.R.

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/25/bucking-blue-wave-republicans-would-be-smart-to-focus-on-hispanic-voters-in-2018.html","The media narrative has been set: a “Blue Wave” is coming in the 2018 midterm elections, as agitated Democrats and independents react to the first years of the Trump Administration. The trend in the generic ballot test, turnout in special elections, and fundraising to date benefiting the left, all provide some evidence that supports Democrat gains. However, we also see nuance in the data that provides a path forward for Republicans who run smart campaigns: namely, there is a significant opportunity for Republicans to attract more votes from Hispanic voters.Based on historical results, it is fair to assume Hispanics will mostly support Democrat candidates next November.  In part, this is because many Republicans typically make very little effort in trying to attract Hispanic voters. However, it is also true that Republicans tend to perform better among Hispanics in midterm elections than in presidential elections.This bipartisan study, performed by WPA Intelligence, Deep Root Analytics and Civis Analytics, collected 3,000 interviews of Hispanic adults nationwide in December and January, and the results are encouraging for Republican candidates looking to mine hidden pockets of support in the upcoming election.As with any other segment of the voting public, there are many nuances and distinctions that are driven by views on policies, age, educational attainment, occupation geography, country of origin, and family history in the U.S.Indeed, Republican candidates who understand this and aggressively focus developing a relationship with Hispanics across their constituent bases have realized significant gains by way of support at the ballot box.  In Texas, a state the national press is desperate to say is “trending Blue,” both Governor Abbott and Senator Cruz, each received more than 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in past elections.While many Democrats often appeal to Hispanics on the basis of “identity politics,” we recommend Republicans engage in “idea politics.” Four key issues provide a path for Republican gains among Hispanic voters: tax cuts, repeal of the individual insurance mandate, an “all of the above” energy policy and school choice.Our research found a majority of Hispanics shared the view that tax cuts would grow the economy instead of the alternative proposition that tax cuts would harm vital programs and only benefit the rich. As more Hispanics ascend the ladder of economic opportunity, their personal experience more closely aligns with a Republican worldview that sees the risk posed by over-taxation and over-regulation. America is home to hundreds of thousands of Hispanic business owners, including many small business owners who see excessive government overreach as a greater problem than underfunded social welfare programs.Nearly half of Hispanics surveyed also oppose the government mandating the purchase of products like health insurance. While surely valuing a safety net for the poorest of Americans, these voters know how expensive it is to pay skyrocketing insurance premiums under ObamaCare. Republicans can make inroads on this issue of personal freedom. Similarly, a message emphasizing choice and competition works when it comes to energy production and education. Almost half of Hispanic voters – 47 percent -- support an “all of the above energy policy” that incents production from conventional generation sources, in addition to renewable sources. And despite 25 years of education unions demonizing school choice, 43 percent of Hispanic adults – three in seven – believe parents should have public and private school options to educate our children.Personal choice, competition and freedom are the themes that resonate with Hispanic voters open to these Republican ideas. These voters do not think students in failing public schools should be sentenced to a life of lesser opportunity because of where they happen to live. While supporting a legitimate role for government, many also support a limited role for government, ensuring an economic climate conducive to job creation, and health and energy policies steeped in competition in order to control costs. They embraces the free market ethos of America. And they believe in the American Dream.But Republican appeals to Hispanic voters are not made in a vacuum. The well-funded message machine on the left, assisted by the mainstream media, will surely change the debate from ideas to identity politics. They will cast the Trump immigration policies as divisive, and the only issue Hispanic voters care about. We encourage Republican candidates to not succumb to single-issue thinking. Hispanic issues are American issues, and American issues are Hispanic issues. If Republican candidates want to survive the 2018 mid-terms, they need to not only develop a message centered on freedom and choice, but to use modern tools like data analytics to help them use their limited resources to deliver that message with precision to voters who are open to it.Many firms, in addition to ours, are doing innovative work with such digital tools, allowing campaigns to take their message directly to the right voters, in the right format, with personalized appeals on issues they care about passionately.In many districts this election year, the key will be developing messages that appeal to Hispanic voters. Winning in a challenging election cycle requires mining for voters, even among traditional Democratic constituencies. The Republican campaigns that do this are more likely to be victorious."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/25/reading-tea-leaves-on-bolton-and-other-trump-staff-changes.html","All White House staff members know going in – or should know – that they serve at the pleasure of the president. This is true in the administration of every president, Democrat and Republican. If you’re looking for job security, the White House is not the place for you. As a result, some very fine people who served in the Trump administration – as well as a few who weren’t up to the tasks they’d been assigned – now find themselves on the outside looking in.It’s true that President Trump is impulsive. Folks who have known him from his days in New York say he’s the kind of person who is most influenced by the last person he talked to. He’s more interested in what works than he is grounded in any kind of philosophy of governing. Chaos is part of his management style.The question is not whether this swiftly revolving door bringing people into and out of the White House is discordant: it is. What’s really at issue is whether it’s produced the results President Trump wants. The answer to that question is a qualified yes.President Trump is nothing if not ambitious. His desire to be considered by history as one of the great presidents is enmeshed in his 2016 slogan: if he makes America great again it is because he himself is a great president. And, depending on how you assess presidential performance, he may be well on his way.According to The Heritage Foundation, the think tank that developed many ideas that became part of the Reagan Agenda, President Trump has already accomplished nearly two-thirds of what he set out to do. That’s a remarkable achievement, probably unmatched by any president since Franklin Roosevelt.Even President Reagan, who left office with the three biggest items on his list crossed off as completed – win the Cold War, get the economy growing again, and revive the spirit of America in its institutions and its people – didn’t get everything he wanted. Then, as now, spending continues to be a problem and the government, then as now, continues to grow.Some suggest these problems are insoluble. With Congress having just passed a spending bill that leaves the federal government almost unbelievably well-funded, they might be right. Or not, if the president can get the right people in place to take on issues related to the size and scope of government. So far, he’s still looking for them.There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with the changes President Trump has made thus far. Kudlow for Cohn and Bolton for McMaster are both trade-ups with strong roots in the Reagan Revolution.Kudlow was part of the team that developed the policies the left derided as Reaganomics, but which created 20 million new jobs and an economic recovery that no president since has been able to achieve.Bolton, even though he is more closely associated with George W. Bush than Reagan, is a believer in a muscular foreign policy that gives enemies no quarter they have not earned.In these appointments President Trump may be looking to the past to replicate the kind of successes President Reagan enjoyed and then to build on them.What was true of his campaign is true of Trump’s presidency: there’s more to it, much more, than meets the eye."

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/25/despite-trumps-claims-1-6b-border-fencing/","Since President Trump signed the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill—though it did not include a single provision from his 70-point list of pro-American immigration reforms—he has touted the move as a “start” to a border wall and says “much can be done” with the funding to fulfill his most important campaign promise.Despite Trump’s claims, though, the omnibus purposefully narrows the scope of what the president can do with the $1.6 billion—just 0.12 percent of the spending bill—included in the bill for border security.“Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall,” Trump said in a post on Sunday:Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come – and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2018“Not happy with 1.6 billion, but it does start the wall and we’ll make that $1.6 billion go very far,” Trump said last week during a news conference when he announced that he had already signed the omnibus.No Wiggle RoomThe omnibus, for example, does not allow Trump to “go very far” or even do much with the slim amount of funding for new border fencing given to him by the Republican-controlled Congress.For example, as Breitbart News noted, the omnibus bans Trump from using any of the prototype models of border walls for new fencing on the border. This leaves him forced to only spend $641 million on new fencing that must be constructed from fencing that has been used in other parts of the border.Even more constraining, the omnibus tells Trump exactly where he must put his new fencing. These limits force him to put the new fence only in the San Diego and Rio Grande Valley region of the southern border.Same Old FencingWhen Trump visited the border wall prototypes this month, he derided the current fencing on the border as being insufficient in its attempt to keep illegal aliens from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.“You have hundreds of holes cut in, and patched,” Trump said at the time.This new fencing is not the wall Trump has promised. Instead, the new fencing is merely a continuation of fencing that was approved in the Secure Fence Act of 2006, a project Congress passed but never finished.Additionally, House and Senate GOP leadership have claimed that the omnibus funds 100 miles of fencing for the border wall. That figure is inflated, as only 33 miles of the border will be filled with brand new fencing, while about 77 miles will be filled with more upgraded and additional fencing that already exists.‘Down Payment’Trump’s consistent assertion that the $1.6 billion in new and upgraded fencing for the border is a “down payment” for a larger border wall does not add up to the promise he originally made his working and middle-class base of supporters.For instance, the slim funds cannot be a “down payment” for Trump’s border wall because attached to the funding is a ban on the wall, only allowing the previously-used fencing constructed on the border.Trump’s original plans for a wall—using the existing prototypes that have been sitting in the San Diego desert for half a year now—are expected to cost $18 billion. His Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has requested $25 billion for not only the full construction of a border wall but also for major improvements in the current immigration system.To force Congress to hand over the $25 billion needed to construct the border wall would have to be immediately devised by the Trump administration in order to have it ready in time to present when the omnibus spending bill runs out in September.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/03/25/john-bolton-kurds-get-ally-trump-administration/","The announcement Thursday night that former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton would replace Gen. H.R. McMaster as President Donald Trump’s National Security Advisor confirms the arrival of a new, distinctive voice in the Trump administration.On no issue will Bolton’s firm stance present a bigger departure from establishment dogma than his support for an independent Kurdistan.Bolton has vocally, consistently supported the establishment of an independent Kurdish state, arguing that the Kurds have proven their ability to govern themselves and earned the support of the United States through their reliable cooperation with Washington against a number of jihadist threats, most prominently the Islamic State (ISIS).The Kurdish people are divided among territories belonging to Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, making enemies of all these governments. For decades—and in particular recently, when all four countries faced a growing ISIS presence threatening their stability—Kurds of a variety of factions have proven willing to risk the lives of their armies to defend overlapping interests with America. They take their alliance with the United States seriously and rely only on support from Israel among their neighbors.Yet despite early hope that the Trump administration would support Kurdish aspirations to become independent of the Islamists in Baghdad, Tehran, Ankara, and Damascus, Trump’s Washington has proven fickle. In Iraq, President Trump vowed not to “take sides” between the Kurdish Peshmerga and Iran-backed Shiite militias that have repeatedly threatened to kill Americans. In Syria, America has stood back while Recep Tayyip Erdogan ordered Turkish troops to launch an ethnic cleansing operation against the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ). The Kurds of Turkey have long been under the heel of an on-again/off-again military occupation in Diyarbakir while Erdogan has arrested any politician who voiced concern for them. It is important to note that, unlike the Peshmerga or the YPG, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), the violent Kurdish faction in Diyarbakir, is a Marxist, U.S.-designated terrorist organization.The Peshmerga have openly opposed the PKK, however, and were still forced to accept an Iranian invasion of their Iraqi stronghold Kirkuk. Kirkuk is not originally part of the commonly accepted territory of Kurdistan, but the Peshmerga brought it under Kurdish rule after defeating ISIS there in 2014. The Islamic State took Kirkuk over after the Iraqi army fled.The arguments against supporting Kurdish independence largely boil down to “it’s too complicated. You wouldn’t understand.” As with nearly every other major international conflict, and typically infuriating every “adult in the room” in Washington, Bolton has rejected this holier-than-thou establishment approach to Kurdish independence. Instead, Bolton has repeatedly made the clear-cut case that the Kurdish people have proven their ability to run a federal government in arguably the most volatile corner of the earth.Bolton vocally supported the September 2017 Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) referendum on independence from Iraq.“I think it’s time for the Kurdish people in Iraq to give a voice to their aspirations,” he told Kurdistan 24 at the time. “I think the Kurdish people are de facto independent already.”To Rudaw, another Kurdish outlet, Bolton said at the time,  “I think the government of Iraq has collapsed. I don’t think it can be put back together. I have said the Kurds in Iraq have demonstrated being capable of governing themselves. I don’t see them ever going back voluntarily.”On Breitbart News Daily, where he contributed regularly, he did not change his tone for a non-Kurdish audience.“The Kurds are one of the largest ethnic groups in the world that has never had a nation in contemporary times,” Bolton explained. “Just two days ago, they held a referendum in Iraqi Kurdistan and voted well over 90 percent for independence. I think the United States should support independence for the Kurds. They’ve been friends of ours in the struggle against Saddam Hussein and the struggle against international terrorism. I think they’d be an important buffer against Iran.”“The Baghdad government is controlled by the ayatollahs from Tehran. The American strategy to defeat ISIS, which has relied so heavily on the Baghdad government, I think has been a mistake,” he continued. “I think it’s a mistake for the State Department now, as it did before the referendum, to tell the Kurds ‘don’t hold it,’ and opposing now the inevitable consequences. They’re now going to be de jure independent.”A month later, Bolton argued in a column for the Gatestone Institute that the Kurdish nations, particularly U.S. allies in Iraq, had played a “productive” role in the little good news to surface from the region for several decades.Iraqi Kurdistan became de facto independent from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in 1991, protected by the U.S-led operation known as “Northern Comfort,” which included massive humanitarian assistance and a no-fly zone over northern Iraq. Saddam’s 2003 overthrow opened the prospect of reunifying the country, but Iranian subversion, using Iraq’s Shia majority to turn the country into its satellite, refueled Kurdish separatism.Unfortunately, but entirely predictably, our State Department opposed even holding the referendum and firmly rejects Kurdish independence. This policy needs to be reversed immediately, turning U.S. obstructionism into leadership. Kurdish independence efforts did not create regional instability but instead reflect the unstable reality.Independence could well promote greater Middle Eastern security and stability than the collapsing post-World War I order.Bolton was clear in the article—in a way that so few prominent thinkers in American politics —that the Iraqi Kurds do not deserve to be lumped in the same category as the PKK. “Obviously, during the Cold War, Washington and the West generally had no interest in weakening Turkey and its critical geostrategic role as NATO’s southeast anchor against Soviet adventurism,” he notes. Supporting a Marxist terrorist group would have done just that.And yet in this decade, even the PKK have played a prominent role against ISIS. PKK fighters stopped the genocide of Yazidis when the Peshmerga chose against a full battle against ISIS in Sinjar.Elsewhere, the Peshmerga helped liberate Mosul, the second-largest city in Iraq. The YPG, who Washington is currently failing to defend against the Turkish military, helped liberate Kobane, a border town with Turkey; Tal Abyad, a critical ISIS stronghold; and Raqqa, Syria, the “capital” of ISIS.Trump took credit for many of these victories during his State of the Union address this year. With Bolton at his side, he may finally fully lend a hand to those who made them possible. MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

But by Friday, Biden was ducking a 2020 challenge.“[I]f I don’t run it’s not because I’m afraid of losing,” Biden said, according to The Hartford Courant.Biden was speaking to an audience at Southern Connecticut State University on Friday evening, at a discussion moderated by WNPR host Lucy Nalpathanchil.Asked whether he would challenge Trump in the 2020 election, Biden said, “Honest to God I don’t know … I have to be able to stand in front of a mirror and look in the mirror and know that if I don’t run it’s not because I’m afraid of losing, it’s not because I don’t want to take on the responsibility, it’s because there’s somebody better to do it and/or because emotionally I’m not positioned to be all in. And so the jury’s still out.”Three days before, at a rally at the University of Miami against sexual violence, Biden said:“A guy who ended up becoming our national leader said, ‘I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it.’ … They asked me if I’d like to debate this gentleman, and I said no … I said, ‘If we were in high school, I’d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.’”Even the left-wing HuffPost found that remark awkward, in context: “It’s an odd sentiment to respond to violence against women with more violence, but Biden’s comments were met with applause and laughter.”Trump responded with a tweet taunting “Crazy Joe Biden” on Thursday:Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy.

Today’s actions make clear that the organization lacks the credibility needed to be a true advocate for human rights.”State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert also slammed the council on Friday, tweeting, “The anti-Israel bias must stop.”Israel’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Emmanuel Nachshon took to Twitter to blast the council as “a sham, a mockery of the noble purposes it pretends to represent.”“It is an exclusively anti #Israel platform, manipulated by bloodthirsty dictatorships hiding their own massive human rights violations by attacking Israel,” he wrote.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted, “More resolutions detached from reality by the circus of the absurd known as the Human Rights Council.” He called on the body to change its name to “The Council for Resolutions Against the Only Democracy in the Middle East.”Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman said in a tweet that Israel “has no business being in the UN’s Human Rights Council.” He said its “presence there gives legitimacy to … anti-Semitic resolutions, and the farce must end.”World Jewish Congress CEO Robert Singer said on Friday, “The UN Human Rights Council has once again let its biased and obsessive focus on Israel plague its session with its persistence of a standing agenda item dedicated to accusing Israel of wrong-doing and the adoption of a disproportionate number of resolutions containing blatantly one-sided language.”“It is inconceivable that the UN Human Rights Council would devote its precious time to drafting and adopting five one-sided resolutions against Israel, while issuing only one each for notorious human rights abusers such as Iran, Myanmar and the DPRK, and just two for Syria,” Singer added. “We urge this council to immediately cease its vilification of Israel. This continued relentless focus on the world’s only Jewish state will serve only to undermine this council’s credibility and its mandate.”B’nai B’rith International said it “strongly deplores the five unjust anti-Israel resolutions the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) passed today. One resolution, which seeks to call into question the legitimacy of sales of military equipment to Israel, provides new evidence that the council is entirely indifferent to the rights and well-being of those on one side of the conflict — the citizens of the State of Israel defending their right to life, the most basic human right of all.”“This resolution passed with 27 votes in favor, four against and 15 countries abstaining,” B’nai B’rith International continued. “We condemn Belgium and Slovenia as the only European Union members of the Council choosing to vote in favor of this outrageous resolution. We commend the United States and Australia for taking a principled stand by voting against all five resolutions.”“Today’s vote again shows that the council has run amok,” the statement continued. “Only the Security Council can level binding sanctions or an arms embargo, yet when it comes to Israel, the UNHRC has felt empowered over the last few years to create a blacklist of Israeli and multinational companies operating in Palestinian-claimed territory and now threatens states and companies that sell arms that Israel uses to defend itself against hostile regimes and terrorist groups. The council is clearly in urgent need of reform.”The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, welcomed the new motions, with spokesperson Yusuf al-Mahmoud thanking those who voted in favor “for their ability to stand in the face of injustice, arrogance and occupation and to reject the language of threats and coercion.”The resolutions, he said, “reflect an international position in favor of a just and fitting solution to the conflict.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/03/25/pope-francis-jesus-victim-spin-campaign-religious-establishment/","In his Palm Sunday homily, Pope Francis said that Jesus was warmly welcomed by those who felt “left behind” by society, while inciting anger among the elites of his day.All those who felt “left behind and overlooked” were moved to cry out in songs of “spontaneous joy” when Jesus entered Jerusalem, the pope said during his morning Mass in Saint Peter’s Square, while for the reigning religious establishment he was “a source of anger and irritation.”For Christians, Palm Sunday commemorates the day that Christ triumphantly entered Jerusalem on a donkey, marking the beginning of Holy Week.“The liturgy invites us to share in the joy and celebration of the people who cry out in praise of their Lord; a joy that will fade and leaves a bitter and sorrowful taste by the end of the account of the Passion,” Francis said in his homily.In what reads like a list of the “basket of deplorables” of first-century Palestine, Francis enumerated the marginalized groups that welcomed Jesus as a savior in the midst of a “cacophony of singing and shouting.”We can imagine that amid the outcry as Jesus enters the city, “we hear the voice of the forgiven son, the healed leper, or the bleating of the lost sheep. Then too, the song of the publican and the unclean man; the cry of those living on the edges of the city,” he said.On the other hand, we also see clearly throughout the Gospel account that the joy Jesus awakens is, for some, “a source of anger and irritation,” Francis said.“All this joy and praise is a source of unease, scandal and upset for those who consider themselves righteous and ‘faithful’ to the law and its ritual precepts,” he added.“How hard it is for the comfortable and the self-righteous to understand the joy and the celebration of God’s mercy!” he said. “How hard it is for those who trust only in themselves, and look down on others, to share in this joy.”Francis said that Jesus was a victim of a protest that was not grass-roots in origin, but the result of a campaign of slander by the establishment who wanted to see him dead.The fierce cry of those who shout out for Jesus to be crucified “is not spontaneous but already armed with disparagement, slander and false witness,” he said. “It is the voice of those who twist reality and invent stories for their own benefit, without concern for the good name of others.”This campaign involved “‘spinning’ facts and painting them such that they disfigure the face of Jesus and turn him into a ‘criminal,’” Francis said. “It is the voice of those who want to defend their own position, especially by discrediting the defenceless. It is the cry born of the show of self-sufficiency, pride and arrogance, which sees no problem in shouting: ‘Crucify him, crucify him.’”Yet despite this vicious campaign against Christ and his gospel, we “have been saved by his cross, and no one can repress the joy of the Gospel,” he said, and “no one, in any situation whatsoever, is far from the Father’s merciful gaze.”Follow Thomas D.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/25/pollak-conservative-hysteria-omnibus-wrong-self-defeating/","Conservatives are understandably frustrated by the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill that President Donald Trump signed into law, under protest, on Friday.The massive size of the bill makes a mockery of Republican promises since 2009 to restrain spending and return to balanced budget once they returned to power.The large number of giveaways to Democratic Party projects and special interests is a sign that the Swamp is still alive and festering in the Trump era.The fact that the 2,232-page bill was jammed down legislators’ throats with literally no time to read it shows how little has changed in Washington even after the Tea Party.And the lack of real funding for the border wall — Trump’s core campaign promise in 2016 — suggests that Trump is “getting rolled” by both parties.But the omnibus is not a disaster. In fact, Republicans scored many important wins.One is the fact that the bill provides massive new spending for defense — “the largest year-to-year increase in base funding for the Department of Defense in 15 years,” according to the bill’s authors.That funding was badly needed — and will not easily be reversed.Military.com summarizes the highlights:The Navy gets 14 new ships, including a carrier; the Air Force adds 56 F-35s; the Army gets 17 Apache and 11 Lakota helicopters; the Marine Corpsreceives 24 vertical landing F-35Bs; and the Coast Guard gets a long-needed icebreaker.All the troops get funding for a 2.4 percent pay raise that took effect at the beginning of the year, with the possibility for more next year.The Air Force also gets $103 million for the wing replacement program on the A-10 Thunderbolt as a start in what Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said earlier this week is a plan to keep the “Warthogs” flying at least to 2030.Most conservatives — from skeptical libertarians to hawkish neoconservatives — agree that national security is the first priority of government. The new defense spending will help the U.S. military catch up to the pace of Chinese expansion, and keep other threats in check.Yes, there will need to be budget cuts in the future. But the new commitment to defense makes it more likely that cuts will have to come from other discretionary spending, and long-overdue entitlement reforms.In addition, the omnibus spending bill included many riders that conservatives should applaud. Some had little chance of passing any other way.Foremost among these is the Taylor Force Act, which will cut off most U.S. foreign aid to the Palestinian Authority unless it stops paying stipends to terrorists and their families — which it will not do.The importance of that law cannot be overstated. It will radically shift relations between Israelis and Palestinians in Israel’s favor. It will also send a clear signal to the world that the U.S. will hold other governments responsible for supporting terrorism.Other riders included the Fix NICS Act, a Trump administration- and National Rifle Association-backed bill that will improve the nation’s background check system for gun purchases. The bill ought to take some of the wind out of the sails of the anti-gun movement.Another addition was a fix to the “grain glitch,” a provision in last year’s tax cut that accidentally discouraged farms from selling their produce to private buyers and favored sales to cooperatives instead.Conservatives can also take heart from what was not included in the omnibus. The Trump administration held out against Democrat demands for full amnesty for 1.8 million “Dreamers” — i.e. illegal aliens brought into the country as minors.Republicans also prevented the bill from giving massive subsidies to insurance companies on the Obamacare exchanges after President Trump ended the Obama administration’s payments, which had been ruled unconstitutional by a federal court last year.So while there are many reasons to complain about the omnibus, there are also things to celebrate. The cause of fiscal reform is not dead: now, with defense adequately funded, is the best opportunity for Trump to make good on his promise to tackle the national debt.Conservatives should not be distracted by the gloating of Democrats like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), or the trolling of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). They know that declaring victory is a good way to separate Trump from his base.The fact is that Trump crushed them in the last budget negotiation, when they foolishly shut down the government to protect illegal aliens. And this time, Trump achieved long-sought Republican priorities, even if they came at an admittedly heavy price.Rather than despair — would the cause really be served by handing Congress back to Democrats? — conservatives should prepare for the next fight, which will be backed by a presidential veto.Joel B.

Although the final list (for the World Cup squad) has not been announced yet, the fact that right now I am in this team means I am very happy and proud.”Iran cannot admit it bans players for appearing against Israelis because there are strict international rules against political interference in sports.The issue has come to the fore in recent weeks after wrestler Alireza Karimi Mashiani was given a six-month ban for deliberately losing a world championship match in Poland in November in order to avoid an Israeli opponent in the next round.The head of Iran’s wrestling federation quit last month in disgust, saying young athletes were being forced to lie and the authorities were letting them pay the price for their policies.“Forcing an athlete to accept defeat or run around all night looking for a doctor’s note is not right,” Rasoul Khadem, an Olympic gold medallist, told public radio ahead of his resignation.Iran is due to play another friendly against Algeria in Tehran on Tuesday.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/24/pollak-march-lives-demagoguery-looks-like/","There are three things to know about the March for Our Lives on Saturday.One is that the protests banned speakers who support the Second Amendment — including student survivors like Kyle Kashuv and relatives of victims like Hunter Pollack.As far as protecting the lives of students is concerned — which is, ostensibly, the entire point — the march organizers were uninterested in an open conversation about what might actually be effective.The second thing to know is that President Donald Trump had already banned bump stocks and signed expanded background checks and school safety measures into law by the time the marches began.The speakers demanded legislation, but there was no more legislation to pass — at least, no legislation that would ever survive the Supreme Court. Many of the marchers simply want to repeal the Second Amendment. There was little room for discussion of reasonable proposals.The third thing to know is that the marches were backed by big leftist organizations, and accompanied by get-out-the-vote efforts.These are further signs that the marches are largely about mobilizing support for the Democratic Party in the 2018 midterm elections. The speakers made little effort to hide that fact. They called for national unity — against the Republican Party.The efforts of the Democratic Party and the institutional left are being amplified by Hollywood and the mainstream media. The gun issue is almost secondary: this is all part of a left-wing backlash against Trump’s election, and the opposition is using every weapon in its arsenal.They may succeed in November. But they will not stop there. The marches have featured signs calling for the National Rifle Association to be banned outright. One sign attacked Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) — one of the moderate voices on this issue — as a “killer,” and questioned his Catholic faith.The “children” who are being impressed into service for the left — some savoring their moment in the “revolutionary” spotlight — are being misled by adults who should know better. They are being taught that those who disagree with them are literally their mortal enemies. And they are being taught to hate the Second Amendment before most have been taught what it is, or why it exists.To quote Edmund Burke: “You began ill, because you began by despising everything that belonged to you.”Many of the marchers, last week and this weekend, chanted that familiar left-wing refrain: “This is what democracy looks like!” Perhaps so: mob rule is the crudest form of democracy.But the very reason we have the Second Amendment — and the First Amendment, which makes these marches possible — is that the Founders of our Republic wanted to put certain liberties beyond the reach of the majority. They understood that the dignity of the individual — including the inherent, God-given right to self-defense — could not withstand the temporary passions of the moment without special protection.And so it would be more accurate to say: “This is what demagoguery looks like.” If it is the model for the activism of the next generation, America is in grave danger.Those who own guns — or cherish the right to own them — should see these marches as a wake-up call. The rights and freedoms that make our country great are just one Supreme Court seat, and perhaps one election, away from destruction. Beyond the political frustrations of the moment, that is what is at stake in November.Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/24/exclusive-kentucky-seeks-to-transform-welfare-by-hiring-private-contractors/","Adam Meier, deputy chief of staff to Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, called for greater state flexibility in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News to hire private contractors to better service entitlement programs and benefit Kentucky taxpayers.Kentucky serves at the vanguard of the conservative movement to reform welfare and entitlement programs. Now, the state has proposed contracting out their welfare services to private contractors to provide better service at a lower cost.MEDICAID WORK REQUIREMENTSIn January, Kentucky became the first state to implement work requirements for Medicaid recipients.Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin said during the announcement:With federal approval of our Medicaid waiver, Kentucky will lead the nation in constructive changes to Medicaid. This marks the first significant change to a federal entitlement program in more than 20 years. The result will be a transformational improvement in the overall health of our people and will provide a model for other states to follow.Aides to Gov. Bevin estimated that roughly half of 350,000 Kentucky Medicaid recipients already meet the new Medicaid requirements to work at least 80 hours per month, volunteer, or commit to job training. Under the waiver, Kentucky Medicaid recipients will have to submit documentation proving that they comply with the Medicaid work rules. The Kentucky government suggested that with the Medicaid work requirements, they will save roughly $2 billion federal and state dollars over the next five years.The Medicaid work requirements would only apply to able-bodied working-age adults. Americans with disabilities, older Americans, children, and pregnant women would not have to comply with potential Medicaid work stipulations.One Bevin staffer suggested that the state’s Medicaid rolls will be reduced by roughly 95,000 within the next five years because of the work requirements.Bevin added at a press conference in January, “Why should a working-age person not be expected to do something in exchange for what they are provided?”Not satisfied with Kentucky’s Medicaid work requirements, Gov. Bevin’s deputy chief of staff, Adam Meier, argued in an interview with Breitbart News that they would like to implement more reforms to their entitlement programs.PRIVATIZING ENTITLEMENT SERVICESMeier testified during a House Education and Workforce Development hearing on March 15.In his testimony, Meier called for states to have greater flexibility for “state and local partners to leverage the private sector workforce.”Meier’s proposal would allow for states to use contractors to service welfare and entitlement programs.Breitbart News asked Meier in an exclusive interview how contracting out services such as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), or food stamps to private contractors would benefit Kentucky entitlement program recipients and taxpayers.Meier told Breitbart News, “States are in the best position to determine how to staff their own workforces. There are several scenarios in which this flexibility can help a state. First, contracting can be a more cost-effective way to deliver services. With pensions and other legacy costs, it can be significantly more expensive to hire a state worker to do the same service. Second, contracts can include service level agreements that require certain milestones to be met, such as call line wait times or the number of applications processed. Often, contractors can achieve targets that a state workforce cannot with the same funding. Third, it would allow the same private contractors who are already conducting eligibility service for one program to do it for all programs in one application—something our technology allows for, but federal policy does not.”The Kentucky deputy chief of staff continued, “Finally, contracting allows more flexibility to quickly augment state staff when there may be a workload surge—something state governments cannot do because of burdensome hiring requirements. An example of this is when Kentucky launched a new eligibility IT system and a backlog was created in our offices and online tasks. Had we been able to leverage private contractors, we could have worked through the backlog much more quickly, and more effectively served program recipients who were at risk of losing critical services. Ultimately, properly managed private contractors could deliver better services in a more cost-effective manner, benefiting taxpayers and program beneficiaries.”Meier explained that through performance-based contracts, private workers can drive better outcomes compared to state bureaucrats.Bevin’s deputy chief of staff suggested, “Both can be effective if properly managed, and it would depend upon specific circumstances. Private contractors can be most effective in an environment where the state can use performance-based contracts.  In other words, when the state is paying for “outcomes” rather than just people or processes, then the state is paying for a desired result—a result that can be harder to obtain in a state workforce, where there is little flexibility to provide monetary incentives (carrots or sticks) to drive performance.  However, state staff knowledge of policy and processes will continue to be key in helping monitor compliance with federal requirements.”Meier explains in his testimony to the House Education and Workforce Development Committee how this program would help state entitlement programs:For example, states can generally contract out work and training activities in a variety of programs, but the ability to contract out eligibility and related services varies greatly in each, as evidenced in the chart I have provided.The chart is laid out with common programs that families or individuals may access. In some cases, they may access two or more. For example, a family with a child on CHIP could be receiving SNAP. Whereas states have full flexibility and authority to contract out for TANF and CHIP, other programs do not provide that, with SNAP being particularly limiting. If a state uses a contractor, as is done in many states to help the aforementioned family with a child in the CHIP program, and that same family wants to talk about their SNAP eligibility, the contractor must pass the family off to a state or local human services staff person.This is inefficient and poor customer service. It also does not allow for flexibility to meet workflow surges and contractions.The following chart describes how expanding states’ flexibility to use private contractors can better service entitlement recipients in TANF, CHIP, SNAP, Medicaid, and unemployment insurance:Kentucky Private Contractor TableAs the table details, private contractors have the largest restrictions in Medicaid, unemployment insurance, and SNAP; private contractors largely cannot determine eligibility, redetermine eligibility, and change welfare status changes in these entitlement and welfare programs.Gov. Bevin’s deputy chief of staff then explained that through Kentucky Medicaid waiver, they have already started to utilize private contractors in some of their programs.Meier told Breitbart News, “As part of 1115 waiver implementation, we already have moved (or are in the process of moving) the Employment and Training programs from state agency staff to local Workforce Innovation Boards (WIBs), who leverage private contractors to deliver services. We will always look for ways to deliver better services in a cost-effective manner. If the flexibility is granted to states, we will assess how and to what extent we could best use it in the eligibility space.”In the House Education and Workforce Development hearing, Meier charges:For that reason, I would ask that Congress provide states full flexibility and authority to contract
out services for all of these programs. We are not suggesting this be mandated, but believe it
should be an option. Governors and agencies should have the ability to determine the right mix
of state staff and contracted services to effectively and efficiently delivery services and drive
performance-based results.Robert Doar, the Morgridge Fellow in Poverty Studies at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), told Breitbart News in an interview that “There’s a lot of aspects of programs that have private entities help with, it’s not new.”“There is one element in food stamps that says that only government employees can determine eligibility, ” Doar explained. “That has led to a very limited use of privatization in food stamps.”Doar argued that the contracting entitlement program services to private workers offers “one central place” for entitlement recipients.“He’s [Meier] saying that he would like greater flexibility with that and I don’t object to that. I think there are benefits to allowing agencies to do multiple programs in one place.”Doar, however, did caution that privatizing entitlement program services should be combined with President Trump’s campaign promise to “get our people off of welfare and back to work.”PAST SUCCESS WITH PRIVATE CONTRACTORS IN WELFARE PROGRAMSRep. Buddy Carter (R-GA) told Breitbart News in a November interview how hiring private contractors to confirm eligibility for Medicaid and other entitlement programs can “cut costs through eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse.”Rep. Carter sponsored H.R.1333, the Freedom to Use Contracted Entities Act – a bill that would allow private contractors to make eligibility determinations on behalf of State Medicaid programs – an idea that could have far-reaching implications for cutting waste, fraud, and abuse throughout federal and state bureaucracies.Rep. Carter told Breitbart News that Illinois hired private contractors to confirm eligibility for their state Medicaid program to curb costs and fraud, and they saved millions doing so. Carter said:Well, fortunately, Illinois had some experience with this. The state of Illinois actually had an outset group, a private contractor, to determine breach of eligibility of people in the Medicaid program and they did exceptionally well. They found that files had missing evidence some people were deceased that were applying for benefits again, and they were not verifying social security numbers, and they brought in a vendor into Illinois, and they reviewed over 5,000 cases, and they ended up canceling almost over half of them. Unfortunately, they had a union case brought against them against the state to halt the use of private contractors, and a judge ruled in their favor, and they had to end that. What we are trying to do is change the statute, so they can use private contractors.By the end of the first year, Illinois had identified and disenrolled roughly 300,00 ineligible welfare recipients. By the second year, the state had disenrolled an additional 400,000 welfare recipients from the program. This represents more than ten percent of Illinois’ entire Medicaid program removed each year.Based on projections from Illinois Policy, taxpayers could save between $390 and $430 million per year, with even greater savings coming over time. This figure represents nearly two percent of the state’s $20 billion Medicaid budget.Carter then suggested that this idea to confirm eligibility through contractors for entitlement programs could also be applied to other entitlement programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs.The Georgia congressman said, “There’s not a question about it. Making sure that beneficiaries get their benefits in a timely manner is very important as well. Again, these are people that need, truly need these programs, and make sure they’re not on a backlog, and make their applications are going through.”“Giving states the flexibility to reform their programs is just common sense,” Carter added.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

But in a matter of days, left wing and gun control groups hijacked the march and transformed it into a turn out-the-liberal-vote rally.“Vote them out!” people chanted on stage and on the ground, as young people took to the podium to demand Congress pass laws to ban certain guns and restrict gun purchases. One sign at the March for Our Lives event in Washington, DC, on Saturday, called for voting out the GOP.

So people like Indivisible, who represent students who are in lower-income communities and don’t get to speak out the way we do because people don’t listen — we have to connect with these students.The National Park Service does not provide crowd estimates, but it released a permit filed for the event that planned on 500,000 people.View of March for Our Lives protest from several blocks away from main stage pic.twitter.com/4IuS7tfTtZ— Michelle Moons (@MichelleDiana) March 24, 2018The crowd was protected by a massive force of heavily armed D.C.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/24/climate-change-could-make-opioid-crisis-worse-claims-professor/","Climate change could make the opioid crisis worse, a Penn State University professor claims.According to CleanTechnica:In 2016, more than 63,600 Americans died from drug overdoses, triple the 1999 rate. The overprescribing of opioid painkillers largely is driving this spike in deaths. But experts suggest that other things also are at work — including the effects of climate change.Scientists who have been studying opioid deaths across the country believe that socioeconomic factors and natural disasters should become part of any national conversation about how to tackle America’s wave of opioid deaths. In recent years, global warming has fueled a growing number of turbulent weather events that have taken a grim toll on the human psyche.“It is reasonable to expect that damage and destruction cause emotional and mental health problems and lead to drug abuse, both new and existing users,” said Stephan Goetz, professor of agricultural and regional economics at Pennsylvania State University. “There are long-lasting effects of such calamities, and they do not tend to diminish.”And perhaps, Professor Goetz’s co-author goes on to suggest, Hurricane Katrina might be the reason so many more people started taking opioids in New Orleans…The incidence of drug deaths in New Orleans, for example, between 1999 and 2004 was 3.45 drug deaths per 100,000 people, a rate that rose to 16.1 between 2005 — when Hurricane Katrina struck — and 2014, according to Meri Davlasheridze, assistant professor of marine sciences at Texas A&M, who is working with Goetz. Areas affected by Superstorm Sandy also showed a sharp increase in drug death rates after 2012, she said. “There are many factors that contributed to this rise, and disasters are one of them,” she said.And here – courtesy of Numberwatch – is a short list of some of the other things that experts such as Goetz and Davlasheridze have claimed are caused by global warming:AIDS, Afghan poppies

The Kansas Republican primary for governor is August 7, and it’s likely that if Kobach wins the primary, he will be set to take the governorship.In the 2016 presidential election, President Trump won all but two counties in the state against Democrat challenger Hillary Clinton.Screenshot via The New York Times Kobach has been a staunch ally of Trump’s populist, economic nationalist agenda and has sought to eliminate illegal immigration to help raise wages for America’s working and middle class.After Trump’s historic 2016 victory, Kobach was touted briefly as a potential nominee to lead the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as he is an expert on the issue of illegal and legal immigration and its impact on American workers.Most recently, Kobach announced conservative Wichita businessman Wink Hartman as his running mate in the Kansas gubernatorial election.On the national stage, Kobach has been fighting to defend Kansas’s right to ask potential voters for proof of U.S. citizenship to weed out voter fraud, where there are potentially 18,000 to 33,000 non-citizens on the voter rolls in the state.Additionally, Kobach has also urged the Trump administration to put a question asking U.S. residents if they are citizens back on the 2020 Census, as Breitbart News exclusively reported.This month, Kobach is touring Kansas with Hartman to pitch his conservative reform agenda to citizens and local businesses.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

No, all he can do is build a little pedestrian fence. Nothing that he’s been looking at. None of the prototypes, totally banned.”Coulter is referring to a provision in Ryan’s spending bill that specifically bans Trump from using any of the new border wall designs his administration has commissioned, only allowing instead for previously-used fencing barriers to be constructed.Trump has previously noted how that fencing has not been effective in stopping illegal aliens from pouring across the southern border.“No, the bill actually prohibits him using any of the prototypes,” Coulter continued. “It states what kind of ‘barrier’ can be used, i.e. one that we’re absolutely sure Mexicans can get across.”“He can repaint some fences,” Coulter said. “There’s a fence down by the San Diego border and he can repaint that.”Coulter said that unlike her previous pleas to voters to vote for Republicans over Democrats, when it comes to the 2018 midterm elections “there’s no point.” because GOP and Democrat lawmakers “seem to all agree: They want open borders, cheap labor for the Koch brothers, voters for the Democrats. I think we’ll all be in happy unison for the end of America.”Trump’s signing of the omnibus that does not provide any reforms to the current legal and illegal immigration system — even though Republican voters say reducing immigration is their top priority — is “Paul Ryan Republicanism,” Coulter said.“This is it. This is it. In one generation this country is going to be South Africa,” Coulter said. “We had this one chance to save it and we were betrayed.”As Breitbart News has reported, South Africa has started the process of attempting to take land from the country’s white minority without compensation, a plan supported by radicals and black nationalists. Likewise, in 2017, South Africa saw a surging death toll of white farmers.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder. MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

You’re leading us forward. Nothing can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change.— Barack Obama (@BarackObama) March 24, 2018During Obama’s first term in office, Democrats held the House and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate. The former president and the Democrats could have passed any legislation they wanted. They did nothing about guns.It was only during his second term, when Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress, that Obama began to demand gun control.On several occasions, both he and Hillary Clinton have praised the idea of national gun confiscation by pointing to Australia’s continent-wide forced gun buyback program as an ideal. Mainstream media fact checkers, like the far-left Washington Post’s Glenn Kessler, continue to try and cover this fact up.In June of 2014, Obama said:Couple of decades ago, Australia had a mass shooting, similar to Columbine or Newtown. And Australia just said, well, that’s it, we’re not doing, we’re not seeing that again, and basically imposed very severe, tough gun laws, and they haven’t had a mass shooting since. Our levels of gun violence are off the charts. There’s no advanced, developed country that would put up with this.In October of 2015, while running for president, Hillary Clinton said:You know, Australia’s a good example, Canada’s a good example, [and] the UK’s a good example. Why? Because each of them had mass killings, Australia had a huge mass killing about 20 or 25 years ago. Canada did as well, so did the UK. In reaction, they passed much stricter gun laws. In the Australian example, as I recall, that was a buyback program. The Australian government as part of trying to clamp down on the availability of … weapons offered a good price for buying hundreds of thousands of guns and basically clamped down going forward, in terms of having more of a background check approach – more of a permitting approach.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

If they did, they would have let me speak, and they didn’t. I don’t know what this is about.”Hunter read part of his prepared speech on camera, which was shared on Facebook:Hunter’s father, Andrew Pollack, shared his frustrations in a Facebook video on Saturday.“My son, he got denied to speak at the march, so I’m not going to the march,” Pollack said. “He was pretty disappointed that he didn’t get to speak at this march. I guess he’s got a different agenda than their agenda.”Pollack sent Breitbart News the full text of Hunter’s speech, posted below:On Valentine’s Day, I had my heart broken. … We all did … and there’s too much sad irony in that to ignore.So today, on this historic event in our nation’s capital with the entire world watching us — as they listen to every word we say — I want to speak about our broken hearts, and what we can do as a country to turn this heartbreak into a mission worth fighting for.In my heart, I know this is not a mission-driven by politics, nor should it be dictated by the left or the right.  This is not a mission specific to color, religion, or economics, but, rather, it’s a mission of love. It’s a mission of safety built upon a foundation filled with common sense and fueled by a common denominator that can bring together every American across this great country.The one common denominator we all share is a desire to LIVE. … We all want to LIVE the greatest life possible.My sister, Meadow Pollack, was living an amazing life filled with love, passion, dreams, family, and fun. She had so much to offer this world. She had so much ahead of her — but — because WE as a school and WE as a community and WE as a society and WE as a state and WE as a nation failed to protect her — my baby sister is no longer part of this equation we call LIFE.What pains me most is that her beautiful life was NOT lost to an incurable disease or a freak accident. She is gone because our schools are not safe.  She is dead because the madness of one young man and his determination to kill was greater than our desire to stop him. Remembering Meadow and the Parkland 17 is something we must all vow to here today. We must promise to take action each and every day until we protect the students of this country. We must protect our students and our schools in the same way we do the patrons at an NFL football stadium and the passengers at an airport and the diamonds in a jewelry store.  We, the students of America, are the most valuable assets this nation has. Therefore, we hereby put all the leaders and parents in this country on notice. Today, we demand you to put a value on our lives — and to protect us above all and everything else.We, as the students of this country, must take our anger and our pain and our desire to LIVE this LIFE to the fullest, and we must channel it into a mission that is obtainable — one that can be achieved without heavy debate, one that everyone can agree upon today, tomorrow, and for decades to come.What happened in Parkland should have resulted in immediate action across America — but it has not. Two weeks ago, a student in Utah tried blowing up a school with a bomb. And then this week in Maryland, we lost another life in a school shooting. The weapons may be different, but the objective is the same, so we NEED to protect our schools from the killers who want to kill.The hatred and sickness that fuels a killer to kill innocent students is something most of us will never understand, but that doesn’t mean it’s something we can ignore. We need to be on a mission to stop these monsters before they take action inside the school. We must demand our leaders help those who are sick, but we must also demand that they protect those of us who are not.  In closing, I ask you to say my sister’s name to yourself. It’s such a beautiful name: MEADOW. If you say her name, it’s impossible not to feel the beauty of who she was and who she always will be.  MEADOW: it makes me think of a sunny day, like this one. A day where the sun shines on our youth and shines on our desire to LIVE a safe and happy LIFE.   I can feel MEADOW right now. She is asking us to come together. She wants us to thank the families and parents of the victims — like my dad, Andrew — and Mr. Ryan Perry — and all the others who are turning their grief into something positive.  She says, “Thank you” for continuing to fight for the survivors and students of all ages.  MEADOW is asking us to be smart and to love and to share the common denominator we share. Embrace this LIFE, make the most of it. … Don’t let it be wasted — and do not allow it to be taken away by a weapon of any kind.  To my sister, MEADOW — who is up in heaven — I promise you here today that dad and I, along with millions of people at our side, will do our part in making schools safe so that this never happens again. We vow to protect America’s children in a way you should have been protected. We will keep them safe from the killers and all the weapons they use. Until we meet again, Meadow, I miss you like crazy.  I love you. We all love you. May you shine on us today and every day going forward. Thank you.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2018/03/24/former-nba-great-steve-nash-usa-mass-shooting-day/","In a letter written to correspond with Saturday’s student march for gun control, former NBA great Steve Nash claimed the USA averages a mass shooting “once a day.”Similar claims have been made by gun controllers for years, and have been debunked at every turn.For example, gun controllers claimed “355 mass shootings” for the year 2015, prompting Mother Jones’ editor Mark Follman to counter that the number of mass shootings was actually four.In other words, gun controllers were swelling the actual number of mass shootings by 351 for that year.Writing in the The New York Times, Follman said:At Mother Jones, where I work as an editor, we have complied an in-depth open-source database covering more than three decades of public mass shootings. By our measure, there have been four ‘mass shootings’ this year, including the one in San Bernardino, and at least 73 such attacks since 1982.How do the numbers get so skewed? They get skewed because gun controllers get their information from websites and studies that count incidents in which four people are shot as a mass shooting, whether those people only suffer minimal injuries or not. This means gang crimes — drive-by shootings, etc — are reclassified as “mass shootings.” Other gang-related shootings become “mass shootings” as well. All the while, the FBI’s standard definition for a “mass shooting” is four fatalities in one incident.So Steve Nash’s claims are very similar to the claim of “355 mass shootings” each year, and have already been debunked.Yet he does make some claims that are closer to accurate, but he does not extrapolate the lessons these claims teach about the failure of gun control.For example, Nash uses a Players Tribune column to claim “15 of the 20 worst mass shootings in U.S. history have occurred since 1999.” The larger lesson is that many of these shootings occurred in schools, even though the USA adopted a ban on guns in schools/on school grounds in during the George H.W. Bush administration. The Gun Free School Zone Act is a dismal failure which has only resulted in teachers and staff being unable to defend themselves when an attack occurs.Nash throws out a smattering of gun control proposals, including universal background checks. In so doing he overlooks the fact that the Parkland Florida gunman passed a background check for his gun, as does nearly every high profile attacker.In the end, gun control is not keeping us safe and more gun control will not change that. Pushing gun control may make us feel good, but good feelings do not allow teachers to defend themselves against armed attackers.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Gabby Giffords (D-AZ) and her husband Mark Kelly were behind the decision of the owner of the New England Patriots to use the team airplane to transport families of victims in the Parkland shooting to Washington, D.C., for the March for Our Lives event on Saturday, Breitbart News has learned.On Thursday, Patriots Owner Robert Kraft dispatched the team plane to Florida to fly the families of the 17 victims of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, and some of the students who were injured and survived the incident, to Washington, DC, for the “March For Our Lives.” But it turns out that gun control advocates were behind the effort to enlist the Patriots in the effort.During a Saturday conversation with Breitbart Sports, Patriots Vice President of Media Relations Stacey James said that Patriots Owner Robert Kraft chose to lend his plane to the Parkland families at the request of former Democrat Representative Gabrielle Giffords, and her husband Mark Kelly.In 2011, Giffords, was shot in the head by a deranged man outside of a grocery store in Arizona while she met with constituents. The shooting killed six people and injured 13 others. Since recovering from her injuries, Giffords has become a tireless proponent of gun control. She formed her own group titled Giffords’ Americans for Responsible Solutions and, in 2016, merged that group with the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.According to James, it was Kraft’s relationship with the Giffords that caused him to get involved.“The Giffords’ reached out, Gabrielle and Mark Kelly,” James told Breitbart Sports. “Mr. Kraft has a very close friendship with the Giffords.

Mr. Kraft did a favor for a friend, because he thought it was the right thing to do. That is the extent of it, we are not taking sides on this issue.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/24/andrew-mccabe-fires-back-again-proclaims-innocence/","FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe made his most significant public relations effort since his firing last week, declaring his innocence of all misconduct in a Friday op-ed in the Washington Post.“I have been accused of ‘lack of candor,'” McCabe writes, neglecting to mention the source of the accusation, DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz’s office, and the follow-on recommendation of the FBI Office of Professional Responsibility that he be fired, continuing:That is not true. I did not knowingly mislead or lie to investigators. When asked about contacts with a reporter that were fully within my power to authorize as deputy director, and amid the chaos that surrounded me, I answered questions as completely and accurately as I could. And when I realized that some of my answers were not fully accurate or may have been misunderstood, I took the initiative to correct them. At worst, I was not clear in my responses, and because of what was going on around me may well have been confused and distracted — and for that I take full responsibility. But that is not a lack of candor.Much of the piece is devoted to unqualified praise of the FBI and the intelligence agencies. “They continued to protect the American people and uphold the Constitution despite the political winds — and the unprecedented attacks on us by the president and other partisans — that buffeted us,” McCabe writes.The unelected intelligence and law enforcement agencies resisting the interests of the political branches is the essence of the “Deep State” paradigm.McCabe also implies this corps of powerful civil servants is under attack. “We cannot afford for young people to be dissuaded from lives of public service by the divisive politics and partisan attacks that now so characterize our national discourse and that, I believe, played a major role in the end of my FBI career,” he explains. “To those men and women, I say: Fear not. Set the headlines aside and give in to what draws you to this work. The country needs you.”McCabe had attracted the ire of some FBI observers since he stepped into the Bureau’s top spot after the firing of his boss and ally James Comey last May. His links to Clinton loyalists and revelations that his office had served as the venue for disgraced FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page’s hatching of an “insurance plan” against the American people’s election of President Donald Trump may have brought him to loggerheads with the administration.While McCabe was interviewed by the House Oversight Committee about these allegations of involvement in political bias, he was officially fired for his “lack of candor” with the DOJ Inspector General’s Office regarding an inquiry into leaks to the media. Some reports indicate this may have involved approving Lisa Page’s leaks to the Wall Street Journal revealing that “a senior Obama Justice Department official” had called McCabe “very pissed off” that he was continuing his investigation into the Hillary Clinton emails found on former convicted sex offender Anthony Weiner’s laptop.After Attorney General Jeff Sessions made the final call to fire McCabe less than two days before he was due to collect his pension, McCabe has been public and vocal in his denials of wrongdoing and insistence on political motives for his dismissal. For example, he issued a lengthy statement within hours of the breaking news of his departure.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/us/politics/elliott-broidy-trump-access-circinus-lobbying.html","WASHINGTON — For Elliott Broidy, Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign represented an unparalleled political and business opportunity.An investor and defense contractor, Mr. Broidy became a top fund-raiser for Mr. Trump’s campaign when most elite Republican donors were keeping their distance, and Mr. Trump in turn overlooked the lingering whiff of scandal from Mr. Broidy’s 2009 guilty plea in a pension fund bribery case.After Mr. Trump’s election, Mr. Broidy quickly capitalized, marketing his Trump connections to politicians and governments around the world, including some with unsavory records, according to interviews and documents obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Broidy suggested to clients and prospective customers of his Virginia-based defense contracting company, Circinus, that he could broker meetings with Mr. Trump, his administration and congressional allies.Mr. Broidy’s ability to leverage his political connections to boost his business illuminates how Mr. Trump’s unorthodox approach to governing has spawned a new breed of access peddling in the swamp he vowed to drain.Mr. Broidy offered tickets to V.I.P. inauguration events, including a candlelight dinner attended by Mr. Trump, to a Congolese strongman accused of funding a lavish lifestyle with public resources. He helped arrange a meeting with Republican senators and offered a trip to Mar-a-Lago, the president’s private Florida resort, for an Angolan politician. And he arranged an invitation to a party at Mr. Trump’s Washington hotel for a Romanian parliamentarian facing corruption charges, who posted a photograph with the president on Facebook.This type of access has value on the international stage, where the perception of support from an American president — or even a photo with one — can benefit foreign leaders back home.Mr. Broidy was open about his business interests, but the administration made no effort to curtail his offers of access to clients or prospective clients.Yet Mr. Broidy was so aggressive, some associates said, that they warned him to tone down his approach for fear that he might run afoul of the president, clients or American lobbying and anti-corruption laws.As with so many other political conventions, Mr. Trump has upended the traditional system of access to the president, among the most prized chits in Washington. That is partly because of lax vetting that has allowed largely unfettered access to Mr. Trump and his White House by loyalists, friends and hangers-on with their own policy agendas or business interests.But it is also because few of Washington’s established lobbyists have close connections to the president. In their place, a new class of insider has emerged, able to lobby the president directly on behalf of clients or business partners, an uncommon opportunity in prior administrations, when lobbyists focused on winning support from lawmakers or regulators.In a statement, Mr. Broidy said the success of his company reflected his recruitment of “the best people, including a number of former flag officers,” not his political connections. “The idea that our success derives from activities around last year’s presidential inauguration is not only misplaced but insulting to the careers and capabilities of our highly trained and decorated veterans,” he said.Mr. Broidy, 60, in some ways personifies this new breed of Trump insider. A lifelong Los Angeles resident who worked as an accountant before making a fortune as an investor, Mr. Broidy grew more interested in politics after the Sept. 11 attacks, which shaped his hawkish approach to foreign policy and concern for the defense of Israel. In 2005, he was appointed to a federal homeland security advisory panel.Mr. Broidy pleaded guilty in 2009 to giving nearly $1 million in illegal gifts to New York state officials to help his company land a $250 million contract with the state’s public pension fund. He paid $18 million in restitution and avoided jail time.As he worked to rebuild his bank account and reputation, he expanded his business interests in the defense and security industry, starting a company called Threat Deterrence in 2013 and purchasing Circinus in July 2015.Mr. Broidy initially supported Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, embracing Mr. Trump only after Mr. Cruz dropped out.His business took off after Mr. Trump’s election. Circinus has won lucrative work from around the world, including contracts worth more than $200 million to do defense work for the United Arab Emirates. And Mr. Broidy openly promoted Circinus’s work in meetings with Mr. Trump and other Republican officials, according to documents and interviews.But Mr. Broidy faces a sudden backlash.One of his business partners, George Nader,  is cooperating with the special counsel, whose investigators have asked about Mr. Nader’s contacts with top Trump administration officials as well as his possible role in funneling money from the U.A.E. to Mr. Trump’s political efforts, according to people familiar with the inquiry.Mr. Nader helped Circinus gain access to U.A.E.’s crown prince, while also using Mr. Broidy as a conduit  to shape Trump administration policy toward the Persian Gulf on behalf of the U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia, both American allies. Mr. Broidy, in turn, appears to have helped Mr. Nader get his photograph taken with Mr. Trump at a fund-raiser, over the unspecified objections of the Secret Service. Mr. Nader has been convicted on charges related to child pornography and sexual abuse of minors.Hundreds of pages of Mr. Broidy’s emails, proposals and contracts were provided to The Times by an anonymous group critical of Mr. Broidy’s advocacy of American foreign policies in the Middle East. Mr. Broidy’s representatives say they have proof that the documents were stolen by hackers working for Qatar in retaliation for his efforts to rally opposition in Washington to Qatar, a regional nemesis of the Saudis and the Emiratis. The Qataris dismiss this charge.The documents reveal that Mr. Broidy, a vice chairman of the finance committee for Mr. Trump’s inauguration, arranged invitations to parties celebrating the event for foreign leaders with whom Circinus worked to sign contracts that could have been worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Broidy in some cases presented the invitations in a manner that suggested they were linked to their countries’ willingness to do business with Circinus.For instance, Mr. Broidy invited Denis Sassou-Nguesso, the longtime president of the Republic of Congo, to a handful of inauguration week events, including the candlelight dinner featuring Mr. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and their wives. “Your name has been submitted and approved,” Mr. Broidy wrote to Mr. Sassou-Nguesso in a note on Broidy Capital Management letterhead. Mr. Broidy stressed that the invitation was from Mr. Broidy and “is not coming from the Joint Congressional Committee” on Inaugural Ceremonies, which oversees the swearing-in and a luncheon at the Capitol.The day after the letter was dated, Mr. Broidy asked his team at Circinus to prepare an invoice for $2 million to Mr. Sassou-Nguesso’s office for “military capabilities assessment and review/services,” according to emails and documents.People close to Mr. Broidy said no invoice was sent and Circinus never worked for the Congolese government. Mr. Sassou-Nguesso declined the invitation to the inauguration festivities, they said.Donors to previous inaugurations were also able to invite foreign heads of state to events as their guests, a spokesman for Mr. Broidy noted.Two officials from Romania, another prospective Circinus client, met Mr. Trump at a private party to which Mr. Broidy invited them during inauguration week at the Trump International Hotel near the White House. Liviu Dragnea, a parliamentary leader who runs the Social Democratic Party, called for closer ties between Romania and the United States, prompting Mr. Trump to declare, “We will make it happen! Romania is important for us!” according to Mr. Dragnea’s Facebook post, reported by McClatchy.At the time, Mr. Dragnea faced corruption charges, which he continues to fight. But for months after the inauguration, Circinus continued pitching his government partly on the access it could provide to Mr. Trump, according to a person who works with the Romanian government and was briefed on the solicitation.Circinus has yet to receive contracts from Romania, people close to Mr. Broidy said. The company entered into an agreement last month with a Romanian government-owned defense company that appears to give it the inside track for contracts valued at more than $200 million, according to Romanian news media and people familiar with the contracting process.Similarly, in a letter dated Jan. 3, 2017, and emailed to top Angolan government officials, Mr. Broidy indicated that he was also sending both an invitation to the inauguration festivities and a proposal for Circinus to provide security services for Angola. In one version of the proposal, the company sought nearly $64 million over five years. “With numerous preparations ahead, we request that you kindly return the executed document no later than January 9, 2017,” Mr. Broidy wrote in the letter to João Lourenço, then the Angolan defense minister, and another Angolan official.Three days before inauguration, the Angolans submitted a $6 million payment to Circinus, which people close to Mr. Broidy say was $2 million less than the Angolans had agreed to pay. That same day, the Angolans and Mr. Broidy met on Capitol Hill with senators including Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, both Republicans, encounters arranged by Mr. Broidy and his team.About one month later, Mr. Broidy again wrote to Mr. Lourenço, discussing plans for him “to be joining us at Mira Largo” — an apparent reference to Mar-a-Lago, where Mr. Broidy is a member and has been spotted introducing guests to the president — “this coming weekend.”“Many preparations have been made in advance of your visit, including additional meetings at the Capitol and the Department of Treasury,” Mr. Broidy wrote.He went on to remind Mr. Lourenço that Angola was past due on “the balance of the payment” for Circinus’s services. “Please make this payment immediately,” he wrote.Not long after Mr. Lourenço was inaugurated as president of Angola in September, Mr. Broidy wrote again to congratulate him and offer to help set up meetings with Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence. “Before the formalities which would naturally be in order between our governments, I am able to assess and advise in this matter, and would be delighted to help foster such closer relation between Luanda and Washington,” Mr. Broidy wrote, referring to the Angolan capital.Mr. Lourenço did not come to Mar-a-Lago and never responded to the letters, according to people close to Mr. Broidy. Circinus never collected any additional funds from Angola beyond the initial $6 million payment, they said.Mr. Broidy emphasizes to potential clients how his connections to Mr. Trump could benefit them, according to several people who have worked with him or heard his pitches.“He was mentioning that he has political connections, and it could be helpful,” said Eymen Errais, a counselor to the Tunisian Ministry of Development, Investment and International Cooperation.Mr. Errais and the department’s minister, Fadhel Abdelkefi, met with Mr. Broidy and Circinus executives in Tunisia a few weeks after Mr. Trump’s election. Circinus sought a contract to build an open-source intelligence center for the Tunisian government, a person familiar with the meeting said, but Mr. Abdelkefi’s ministry instead sought to persuade Mr. Broidy to invest in the Tunisian hospitality industry.Nonetheless, in an email to Mr. Abdelkefi just after the meeting, Mr. Broidy vowed that the center “would be an extremely useful and effective tool for your government” and again emphasized his connection to Mr. Trump. He characterized the incoming administration as “an unprecedented opportunity, in that the House, Senate and executive branch of our government are all under Republican control for the first time in 10 years.”Circinus prepared a proposal for a five-year contract totaling $80 million for the Tunisian work. But Mr. Errais said the Tunisians decided not to do business with Circinus. “A connection with Trump — how would that help us for security?” he said.A person close to Mr. Broidy said he discussed the Republicans’ control of Congress and the White House to suggest that the American government might increase spending on counterterrorism.Mr. Broidy’s allies say he has never hidden the overlap between his business interests and his political activity. In a memorandum about an October Oval Office meeting, for example, Mr. Broidy wrote that he had volunteered to Mr. Trump that his company was seeking a contract from the United Arab Emirates and had tried to arrange a private meeting for the president to discuss the matter with their leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.But as scrutiny has mounted around Mr. Broidy, Republican officials signaled that he would be a distraction at a high-dollar fund-raiser with Mr. Trump this month in Los Angeles. Mr. Broidy helped plan it and was listed as a co-host.After conversations with Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, he volunteered not to attend, according to people briefed on the situation.The dinner and round-table with the president proceeded without him.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/us/politics/trump-lawyers-digenova.html","As President Trump heads into one of the most critical phases of the special counsel’s investigation, his personal legal team has shrunk to essentially just one member, and he is struggling to find any top lawyers willing to represent him.Working for a president is usually seen as a dream job. But leading white-collar lawyers in Washington and New York have repeatedly spurned overtures to take over the defense of Mr. Trump, a mercurial client who often ignores his advisers’ guidance. In some cases, lawyers’ firms have blocked any talks, fearing a backlash that would hurt business.The president lost two lawyers in just the past four days, including one who had been on board for less than a week.Joseph diGenova, a longtime Washington lawyer who has pushed theories on Fox News that the F.B.I. made up evidence against Mr. Trump, left the team on Sunday. He had been hired last Monday, three days before the head of the president’s personal legal team, John Dowd, quit after determining that the president was not listening to his advice. Mr. Trump had also considered hiring Mr. diGenova’s wife, Victoria Toensing, but she will also not join the team.That leaves the president with just one personal lawyer who is working full time on the special counsel’s investigation as Mr. Trump is facing one of the most significant decisions related to it: whether to sit for an interview.That lawyer, Jay Sekulow, is a conservative commentator who made his name on religious freedom cases. Mr. Sekulow is in talks with other lawyers about joining the team, although it is not clear how far those discussions have progressed.Hours before the announcement of Mr. diGenova’s departure, which Mr. Sekulow said was related to a conflict of interest, the president took to Twitter to reject any suggestion that lawyers do not want to work for him.“Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case … don’t believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on,” he wrote. “Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted.”Adding new lawyers, he said, would be costly because they would take months “to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more).”“I am very happy with my existing team,” he added.This month, the president met with the veteran lawyer Emmet Flood about the possibility of joining the legal team. But Mr. Trump was put off by the fact that Mr. Flood, a Republican, had represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment process, and Mr. Flood has made clear that he will not represent the president if Marc E. Kasowitz, his brash longtime personal lawyer, has any role in the effort.Mr. Trump also tried to recruit Theodore B. Olson, a well-known Republican lawyer, but Mr. Olson has said he would not be representing the president.The first phase of legal work for Mr. Trump in the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was led by a White House lawyer, Ty Cobb. That work, which in part involved the production of documents and the arrangement of interviews with White House officials, has been largely completed.The second phase, which is now focused on the question of a presidential interview with Mr. Mueller, had been led by Mr. Dowd. One reason Mr. Dowd quit was that, against his advice, Mr. Trump was insistent that he wanted to answer questions under oath from Mr. Mueller, believing that it would help clear him.Mr. Dowd had concluded that there was no upside and that the president, who often does not tell the truth, could increase his legal exposure if his answers were not accurate.Roger Cossack, a seasoned legal analyst, said the key to successfully defending a high-profile client under immense scrutiny was to have a cohesive legal team with a consistent strategy.“In these types of cases, you need highly competent lawyers and a client who will listen and follow their advice,” Mr. Cossack said. “If you don’t have both, you have what we’re seeing here: chaos and disaster.”“You have a client who clearly thinks he has a better idea of how things should work than the lawyers who, from time to time, have told him things he doesn’t want to hear,” he added. “He is looking for the guy who can say, ‘I know how to handle Mueller, I know you think he is bad, and we’ll take care of it.’ Problem is you can’t find that lawyer because no one will be able to do that.”People close to the president say the upheaval in the legal team was inevitable. When Mr. Kasowitz took the lead after Mr. Mueller was appointed in May, he wanted to follow a model used by Mr. Clinton, with a separate team of lawyers and communications professionals handling issues related to the inquiry, so that the White House staff could keep its distance.But Mr. Trump, who trusts few people and considers himself his best lawyer, spokesman and strategist, never wanted that type of system. As a result, his legal and public relations strategies have been out of sync, with the president at times publicly contradicting his lawyers, and the White House often finding itself flat-footed in the face of new disclosures about the Russia investigation.The president’s decision has also exposed many of his aides, leaving them deeply enmeshed in an inquiry that is likely to cost them tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees.But while Mr. Trump has struggled to find lawyers, his family and his close associates are being represented by some of the country’s top legal talent.His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has hired Abbe Lowell, a longtime Washington lawyer who recently got the Justice Department to drop corruption charges against Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, after a lengthy court fight.Three prominent current and former White House officials — the former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon; the former chief of staff, Reince Priebus; and the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn — are being represented by William A. Burck, who turned down the chance to represent the president. Mr. Burck, a former federal prosecutor, represented FIFA in its legal problems in the United States and has worked for high-profile witnesses in federal investigations, including Maureen McDonnell, the wife of a former Virginia governor.The turmoil in Mr. Trump’s legal team started within weeks of the appointment of Mr. Mueller. Mr. Kasowitz pushed for an adversarial approach to the special counsel, which the president was poised to follow. But Mr. Kasowitz clashed with Mr. Kushner, and he was soon pushed aside after a series of missteps and embarrassing incidents.The president then hired Mr. Cobb, a veteran Washington lawyer, to lead efforts within the White House, as well as Mr. Dowd, who was put in charge of his personal legal team. They advocated a strategy of cooperation, telling the president that the sooner he gave Mr. Mueller’s office what it wanted, the sooner his name would be cleared.While Mr. Cobb had told the president that the investigation would be over by now, it seems to be accelerating. Mr. Mueller is still looking into a wide range of matters related to Mr. Trump’s corporate activities, his 2016 campaign, his associates and his time in office.Mr. Trump, hoping to bolster his team, met with Mr. diGenova and Ms. Toensing in recent days but, according to two people told of details about the meeting, did not believe he had personal chemistry with them.There were also significant conflict-of-interest issues, but Mr. Trump could have waived them if he wanted. Ms. Toensing is representing Mark Corallo, who was the spokesman for Mr. Trump’s legal team in 2017 before they parted ways. Mr. Corallo has told investigators that he was concerned that a close aide to Mr. Trump, Hope Hicks, may have been planning to obstruct justice during the drafting of a statement about a meeting between a Russian lawyer and Donald Trump Jr. during the campaign.Ms. Hicks’s lawyer has strongly denied that suggestion, and White House aides said Mr. Corallo’s assertion had come up in discussions with the president as he weighed whether to go ahead with Mr. diGenova and Ms. Toensing.Mr. diGenova had been expected to serve as an outspoken voice for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on Mr. Mueller. Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president, a theory with little supporting evidence.“There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he had told Fox News in January.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/us/politics/trump-silent-stormy-daniels.html","WASHINGTON — After sixty-one weeks in the White House, President Trump has found two people he won’t attack on Twitter: Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal.The verbose commander-in-chief has posted more than 2,900 times on Twitter since taking office, using the term “FAKE NEWS” to describe everything from the Russia probe and allegations of chaos in the White House to harassment accusations, the size of his inaugural crowds and heated arguments with world leaders.But he has been uncharacteristically silent in recent days — to the relief of his advisers — as a pornographic film star and a Playboy model described intimate details of sexual encounters with Mr. Trump. Stormy Daniels, the porn star, said Sunday night on CBS’s “60 Minutes” that she once spanked the president with a copy of Forbes magazine bearing his face on the cover.For a president who has eagerly attacked just about all of his enemies and accusers, often with colorful nicknames like “Little Rocket Man” for the North Korean leader, “Crazy Joe Biden” or “Sloppy Steve” Bannon, it now appears that only his alleged mistresses and Russian President Vladimir V. Putin are immune to Mr. Trump’s Twitter trash-talk.The fact that the president has not given oxygen to the headlines, however, does not mean that he’s happy.In discussions with allies and some aides, Mr. Trump has privately railed against Ms. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, and insisted that she is not telling the truth. He has reminded advisers that he joined an effort to enforce financial penalties against Ms. Daniels, whose TV interview on Sunday night was hyped throughout the weekend on the cable news channels that Mr. Trump watches obsessively.Mr. Trump dined at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday evening with Michael D. Cohen, his lawyer and longtime aide who is at the center of the Daniels scandal, according to three people familiar with the get-together. The president scheduled the meeting himself, surprising his aides with it a short time before Mr. Cohen arrived, people familiar with the meeting said.Melania Trump, too, has been silent about the allegations. Asked to react to the interviews, Stephanie Grisham, Ms. Trump’s spokeswoman, said: “She’s focusing on being a mother, she’s quite enjoying her spring break and she’s focused on future projects.”It is not clear whether Mr. Trump watched Ms. Daniels’ interview Sunday night, or a similar tell-all interview on CNN Thursday evening, when Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, alleged a 10-month romantic affair with Mr. Trump in which they repeatedly had sex.Sunday’s interview with Ms. Daniels contained few surprises but some humiliating details, such as Ms. Daniels saying she was not attracted to Mr. Trump, and her recollection of spanking him. Virility and strength are key traits the president likes to project, and he once gloated about a New York Post headline quoting a friend of his second wife, Marla Maples, who recalled Ms. Maples saying that Mr. Trump was the “Best Sex I’ve Ever Had.”In the interview, Ms. Daniels said that she had flirted with Mr. Trump in 2006 at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. She said Mr. Trump had compared her favorably to his own daughter during the flirtation, and that she had intercourse with Mr. Trump.Asked by Anderson Cooper whether she had anything to say to Mr. Trump, if he was watching Sunday night, Ms. Daniels said: “He knows I’m telling the truth.”Even that has not prompted Mr. Trump to directly address the central allegations from Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal — that the president cheated on his wife shortly after Melania Trump gave birth to their son, Barron Trump.Mr. Trump did type out a vague “Fake News” tweet Monday morning, although it’s unclear to what he was referring.Beyond the details of their alleged encounters, Mr. Trump’s advisers have been urging the president to keep quiet about the legal wrangling concerning Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal.Ms. McDougal, who accepted $150,000 from the parent company of the National Enquirer to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump, is suing the company to be released from the contract. Mr. Cohen has acknowledged paying Ms. Daniels $130,000 in the days before the 2016 election to keep quiet about her allegations.The attorney for Ms. Daniels has aggressively argued that his client is not bound by the nondisclosure agreement she signed, in part because Mr. Trump himself never signed the document. Michael Avenatti, the lawyer, has repeatedly used Trump-like insinuations to suggest that Ms. Daniels has digital evidence of the intercourse.“We have a litany of more evidence in this case, and it’s going to be disclosed, and it’s going to be laid bare for the American public,” Mr. Avenatti said in an interview Monday morning on Good Morning America.Last week, Mr. Avenatti tweeted a picture of a CD or DVD with the suggestive caption: “If a picture is worth a thousand words, how many words is this worth???? #60minutes #pleasedenyit #basta.”Even that has not prompted a presidential retort — yet.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/world/europe/trump-russia-diplomats-expulsion.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump ordered the expulsion of 60 Russians from the United States on Monday, adding to a growing cascade of similar actions taken by western allies in response to Russia’s alleged poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain.Poland, Italy, Denmark, France and Germany were among 14 European Union member nations announcing plans to expel Russians from their countries in solidarity with Britain, which previously expelled 23 Russian diplomats after the poisoning. Canada also said it would expel four.The American expulsion order, announced by administration officials, includes 12 people identified as Russian intelligence officers who have been stationed at the United Nations in New York, and also closes the Russian consulate in Seattle. The Russians and their families have seven days to leave the United States, according to officials.The expulsions are the toughest action taken against the Kremlin by President Trump, who has been criticized for not being firm enough with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The officials said the action was a coordinated effort with other allies. Poland announced it will expel the Russian ambassador and several other diplomats in response to the poisoning. And Germany announced plans to expel four Russian diplomats within the next week.In a call with reporters, senior White House officials said that the move was to root out Russians actively engaging in intelligence operations against the country, and to show that the United States would stand with NATO allies. The officials said that the closure of the consulate in Seattle was ordered because of its proximity to a U.S. naval base.“Today’s actions make the United States safer by reducing Russia’s ability to spy on Americans and to conduct covert operations that threaten America’s national security,” the White House said in a statement.The Kremlin has maintained that it had nothing to do with the poisoning.Britain’s decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats over the poisoning initially raised tensions between the two countries to a level not seen since the heights of the Cold War. The government vowed to crack down on Russian spies, corrupt elites and ill-gotten wealth in Britain.On March 15, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on a series of Russian organizations and individuals for interference in the 2016 presidential election and other “malicious cyberattacks,” its most significant action against Moscow until Monday.Those sanctions came as the United States joined Britain, France and Germany in denouncing Russia for its apparent role in a nerve-gas attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil, calling it a “clear violation” of international law.White House officials called the nerve agent used against the Skripals “military grade,” but declined to elaborate on the substance used.American officials estimate there are currently more than 100 Russian intelligence officers in the United States.Mr. Trump has said that, despite its denials, Russia was likely behind it. “It looks like it,” he told reporters in the Oval Office on March 15, adding that he had spoken with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain.“We are in deep discussions,” Mr. Trump continued. “A very sad situation. It certainly looks like the Russians were behind it. Something that should never, ever happen. And we’re taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.”Mr. Trump has been slower to act than leaders in Britain, France and Germany over the attack, in which Sergei V. Skripal, 66, a former spy, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, 33, were attacked with a nerve agent.The senior administration officials who described the expulsion order said the three weeks that lapsed between the attack and White House action was due to close coordination among about a dozen American allies.Poland has positioned itself to take a lead role in coordinating a response from the Eastern European nations traditionally most wary of their giant neighbor to the east.The Russian ambassador to Poland, Sergei Andreyev, was summoned to the foreign ministry on Monday morning and informed of imminent diplomatic action against his country. The Polish foreign minister was expected to make an announcement later this afternoon.The Polish foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz called the tragic incident in Britain an “unprecedented attack on civilians with the use of chemical weapon,” that had not been seen since World War II.Mr. Czaputowicz said the Russian ambassador and three other diplomats were now considered “persona non grata,” giving them until April 3 to leave the country.Russia’s overall goal, Mr. Czaputowicz said, is to “disrupt international order and create a sense of danger.”Any expulsion of Russian diplomats would be an unprecedented move on Warsaw’s part, the first time they took diplomatic action against their neighbor due to Russian behavior outside of Poland.Since Poland broke from the Soviet bloc in the 1990s, it has expelled Russian diplomats only twice — and both times had to do with Russia’s spying activities in Poland.Germany’s move not only signaled solidarity with London, but it also suggested the incoming German foreign minister, Heiko Mass, may be more hawkish toward Moscow than his predecessor.“The attack in Salisbury shook us all in the European Union,” Mr. Maas, said. “For the first time since the end of World War II a chemical war agent was used in the middle of Europe.”Mr. Maas said Germany did not take the decision “flippantly.”“But the fact and indications point to Russia. The Russian government has so far not answered any of the open questions and has shown no readiness to play a constructive role in solving this attack,” he said.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/business/economy/labor-professionals.html","When 20,000 West Virginia teachers staged a rare statewide walkout, questions of pay and benefits dominated the headlines. But those concerns could not fully account for the teachers’ ferocious resolve. After all, stagnant wages and receding benefits have been an issue for workers for decades.The missing variable appears to have been anxiety about their status as professionals.Fred Albert, a math teacher and local union official in the Charleston area, said many felt that the Legislature had devalued their training and certification by proposing to let people teach a subject they hadn’t studied and had no experience in.“If someone really wants to be a teacher, if they feel the call to be in the classroom with students, they need to go through the same programs we went through,” he said.In that sense, Mr. Albert and his colleagues were in the mainstream of recent labor history. From doctors and nurses to government workers and journalists, some of the most aggressive and successful labor actions in recent years have erupted when professionals felt their judgment, expertise and autonomy were under assault.Teachers in Oklahoma, who are threatening a walkout on April 2, have expressed similar frustrations, as have adjunct faculty members at a college in Florida and the recently unionized staff of The Los Angeles Times.Robert Bruno, a professor of labor relations at the University of Illinois, said that while compensation and job security were often core concerns, “what really generates this explosion of resistance among professional workers is when they feel they’re the last line of defense between the public they serve and others who would threaten the professionalism of their work.”Some professions, like law and medicine, began to take their modern form in the late 19th century and early 20th century, as science became more rigorous and knowledge became more specialized. Other occupations, like journalism, became more professionalized later in the 20th century by developing an agreed-upon set of norms and best practices.In most cases, said Tracey Adams, a sociologist who studies professions at the University of Western Ontario, the workers tended to be driven by a sense that they were improving society, not just adding to the bottom line. In return, the public and government officials often deferred to them in the areas where they asserted authority. This netted them the resources to do their jobs, the independence to exercise their judgment and widespread public esteem.That has changed in the past few decades, however. “I think that most professions would find that there are a number of forces chipping away at a lot of those tangible and less tangible benefits,” Professor Adams said. “Increasingly people say, ‘I’m not sure I trust you more than the next person.’”Technological developments like the internet have undermined claims to expertise, as anyone can research an illness or dash off a blog post. Shrinking budgets have left teachers and other government workers with fewer resources. Consolidation in the health care and media industries has made doctors, nurses and journalists feel like cogs in corporate machines that don’t share their values.The upshot is a group of workers who perceive a relatively persistent assault on their status, and who occasionally rise up in response.In January, those concerns were in evidence when journalists at The Los Angeles Times, which for more than 100 years stood as one of the most anti-union employers in the industry, voted overwhelmingly to unionize.According to Matt Pearce, a national correspondent who served on the organizing committee, many colleagues were initially ambivalent about unionizing. But that changed when the paper became embroiled in a standoff with the Walt Disney Company, which had denied its journalists access to advance movie screenings in response to an investigative series about the company.After the paper’s newly installed editor, Lewis D’Vorkin, appeared to resist covering the controversy and later criticized reporters for sharing a recording with The New York Times in which he discussed the matter internally, support for the union grew.“It was a very fundamental thing over journalistic principles that had a radicalizing effect on a lot of people in the newsroom,” Mr. Pearce said. Referring to both the newspaper’s leadership and its corporate parent, he added, “There was a palpable sense that they had no patience for the doctrinaire traditional rituals of newspaper journalism.”Doctors and nurses have also reacted viscerally when they believed that managers were limiting their autonomy and disregarding their judgment. In 2014, doctors at an Oregon medical center voted to create a union after their employer proposed outsourcing management of their group. Such a change, now common in the profession, could have increased their pay, but the doctors worried about being forced to see more patients in a day than they could safely treat.The hospital eventually abandoned the outsourcing initiative and agreed to a contract addressing most of the doctors’ concerns after about 18 months of bargaining.Nurses at the community hospital in Altoona, Pa., briefly went on strike that same year, not long after their facility became part of the Pittsburgh-based medical behemoth UPMC. The nurses felt that management was leaving their hospital understaffed, and that their new overseers had no time for their input.Paula Stellabotte, a nurse at the hospital, said that her colleagues had won some concessions but that adequate staffing remained a struggle, along with having a say in hospital policies.“It always amazed me that they had money for consultants, but we’re right here,” Ms. Stellabotte said. “They don’t need to pay consultants.”At Hillsborough Community College in the Tampa, Fla., area, adjunct faculty members unionized in 2016, provoked by their meager compensation and a sense that the administration had no respect for their expertise.Cheryl DeFlavis, an adjunct sociology professor, said the main issue was “exclusion from the policies that shape campus life.” For example, she said, she and her fellow adjuncts teach a significant portion of the classes on campus but have almost no say over textbook choice.“To complete your degree and jump through hurdles to get a job, and then they make that choice for you, is pretty frustrating,” Ms. DeFlavis said. “To top it off, it’s usually someone outside your field. They might not pick a book you feel like students benefit from.”(A college spokeswoman said that adjuncts could take part in meetings of the textbook committee but that only full-time tenured professors could vote on books.)Still, public-school teachers have arguably endured the most direct challenge to their professionalism in recent years.“There has been a decade, two decades of bipartisan attempts to reform education that left out teachers,” Professor Bruno, the labor-relations expert, said. “They’ve seen it in a million small cuts, and some other really large frontal bludgeonings.”In some districts around the country, for example, teachers have been required to clock in and out each day on a computerized clock, in the tradition of factory workers.“It was different because we’re not considered hourly employees. We’re salaried,” said Beverly Reynolds, the president of the teachers’ union in Davidson County, N.C. “Some of them were sitting there thinking, ‘I clock out, but then I get home and do three hours of work at night.’” (The county superintendent agreed to end the clocking-out portion of the ritual in 2016 after years of complaints. The practice continues in other districts.)And teachers across the country bemoan the rise of merit-based pay incentives and the growing use of standardized test scores for their evaluations.Some of these frustrations boiled over into a tense, seven-day teachers’ strike in Chicago in 2012, which was widely seen as a flash point in the national debate over more businesslike approaches to managing schools. As a result of the strike, teachers reduced the portion of their evaluation based on student test scores to 30 percent, from a proposed 40 percent.“It was just ridiculous — not a way to show what I’m doing in the classroom,” said Lillian Kass, who teaches high school special education in Chicago.The anger shows little sign of dissipating. In Oklahoma, teachers complain of being near the bottom in the country in pay. But some say it is the near-collapse of their profession in the state that has truly demoralized them.Ed Allen, president of the local teachers’ union in Oklahoma City, said there were about 2,000 emergency certified teachers in the state, exempted from traditional certification requirements to fill staff shortages. In some schools, such teachers account for nearly half the faculty.“God bless people who are trying to get in and help learn a new profession, but these folks come in at square one,” Mr. Allen said. “They don’t know lesson plans, rules and procedures. They don’t know grading.”As teachers see it, he added, “this is just a symptom of a lack of respect for our profession.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/us/politics/richard-grenell-germany-ambassador-confirmation-trump.html","For months, scores of President Trump’s nominees for posts from ambassadorships to deputies at cabinet-level agencies have been stalled, awaiting confirmation hearings.But few drives for a confirmation vote have turned into a cause — supported by groups often on opposite sides of the political spectrum — like Richard Grenell’s.Mr. Grenell, a Republican who worked with the incoming national security adviser, John R. Bolton, at the United Nations, was nominated by Mr. Trump last year for the ambassadorship to Germany, becoming the president’s most prominent openly gay appointee.The Senate Foreign Relations Committee advanced his nomination at the end of October, and he appears to have enough support to clear the full Senate.But like other nominees, he is trapped in arcane parliamentary tactics.Democrats in the Senate have expressed concern about Mr. Grenell’s sometimes caustic Twitter posts. But his nomination has attracted support from an unlikely coalition of conservative commentators and gay rights activists.Stuart Milk, who co-founded the Harvey Milk Foundation in honor of his uncle, a prominent gay civil rights pioneer in California who was gunned down decades ago, said he believed that Mr. Grenell’s confirmation would “send an important message” about the gay community’s having a place in the Trump administration.“I understand those who are frustrated with the Trump administration and the actions the Trump administration has taken” who have also opposed Mr. Grenell, Mr. Milk said. “And I think that’s misguided.”“It would be a huge void” if the nomination didn’t proceed, he said.The Log Cabin Republicans, a gay conservative group, have also criticized the Senate’s delay.Hugh Hewitt, a conservative radio host, has for weeks promoted Mr. Grenell’s nomination and questioned why it has not moved forward.“Ric Grenell not getting confirmed is an embarrassment,” Mr. Hewitt told Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, on a broadcast this month.“Would you go to the leader and get that scheduled?” Mr. Hewitt said. “I just can’t get over this.”Mr. Grenell, who quietly helped with Mr. Trump’s transition process, was the longest-serving American spokesman at the United Nations, working with four United States ambassadors there and especially closely with Mr. Bolton, a staunch foreign policy conservative. Mr. Grenell declined to comment for this article, but he has told allies that he would not take a job at the National Security Council under Mr. Bolton and that he is committed to the ambassadorship.Senate officials from both parties said a senator appeared to have placed a hold on his nomination, which means moving forward with a vote would require 30 hours of debate, burning up most of a business week. Senate rules do not require the name of the legislator requesting the hold to be made public.Last week, when the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, called for Mr. Grenell to move ahead by unanimous consent, which requires a voice vote, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, declined to advance the nomination.Democrats cite concerns about Mr. Grenell’s vocal criticism of the news media on Twitter as a concern.In particular, he excoriated as biased journalists who did not report on the revelations in the hacked emails from the Hillary Clinton campaign chairman, John D. Podesta, when they were made public by the website WikiLeaks.Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, said the Senate needed to change the rules to speed up the process.“Today, Democrats deliberately delay in ways that limit us to a couple of nominations in a typical week,” Mr. Barrasso said on the Senate floor last week.Republicans have consistently faulted Democrats for the lack of movement on nominees. So has the White House, where officials have repeatedly criticized Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.But privately, some White House advisers say Mr. McConnell could do more — like keep lawmakers in Washington — to force nominations through even with the existing rules.Other opponents have dismissed Mr. Grenell as an avatar for gay rights.Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist with the firm SKDKnickerbocker and a vocal supporter of gay rights, said in an email, “I don’t think having Richard at the table helps the movement one bit.”For instance, she added, last week “President Trump announced his plan to discriminate against trans troops fighting their country and Grenell, still waiting for his seat at a homophobic table, stayed silent.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/world/middleeast/us-bombs-qaeda-libya.html","BENGHAZI, Libya — The United States military carried out its first ever drone strike against Qaeda militants in southern Libya this weekend, signaling a possibly significant expansion of the American counterterrorism campaign in the North African nation.Until now, the Pentagon had focused its counterterrorism strikes in Libya almost exclusively on Islamic State fighters and operatives farther north — eight since President Trump took office. In 2016, the military conducted nearly 500 airstrikes in the coastal city of Surt over several months to destroy the Islamic State’s stronghold there.But the attack on Saturday that the military’s Africa Command said had killed two militants — later identified by a spokeswoman as belonging to Al Qaeda’s branch in northwestern Africa — took place in the country’s southwest, a notorious haven for a deadly mix of Al Qaeda and other extremist groups that also operate in the Sahel region of Niger, Chad, Mali and Algeria.“This appears to be the continuation of expanding AFRICOM activity in Libya’s ungoverned areas,” said Deborah K. Jones, who served as United States ambassador to Libya from 2013 to 2015, referring to the Africa Command.A missile fired by the American drone struck a house in Ubari, 435 miles south of Tripoli, in an area close to major oil fields that was wracked by violent ethnic feuding in 2015. Pictures in Libyan news media outlets showed a mutilated corpse lying in the rubble of a house, and a pair of shrapnel-ridden vehicles nearby. Local residents were quoted by the media outlets as saying the house had been frequented by foreigners.In a statement, the military’s Africa Command said the strike had targeted militants with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, an affiliate also known as AQIM, and had been carried out in coordination with the United Nations-backed unity government in Tripoli. “At this time, we assess no civilians were killed in this strike,” the statement said.The strike came as the Trump administration has been reassessing the American military commitment in North and West Africa after the ambush in Niger last fall that killed four American soldiers. The Pentagon has been preparing to fly armed drone missions from Niger’s capital, Niamey, a step that diplomats and analysts say could further widen the Pentagon’s shadow war in this part of the continent.In a sign of how the Pentagon has sought to obscure its operations in Libya and other parts of northwestern Africa, the Africa Command did not announce the strike on Saturday.It responded to questions from The New York Times late Saturday with a terse statement after media reports about the strike circulated in Libya. The statement did not identify where the drone had originated.Earlier this month, in response to a Times query, the Pentagon acknowledged for the first time that Green Berets working with government forces in Niger had killed 11 Islamic State fighters in a firefight in December. No Americans were hurt in that fight, the Pentagon said.Ubari is at the intersection of the powerful criminal and jihadist currents that have washed across Libya in recent years. Roughly equidistant from Libya’s borders with Niger, Chad and Algeria, the area’s seminomadic tribesmen are heavily involved in the smuggling of weapons, drugs and illegal migrants through the lawless deserts of southern Libya.Some have allied with Islamist militias, including Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which operates across Algeria, Mali, Niger and Libya.The area erupted into conflict in 2014 when a century-old peace treaty between the Tuareg and Tebu ethnic groups collapsed over a dispute about control of the fuel smuggling trade. The fighting, which occurred independently of the broader struggle for control of Libya after the 2011 overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, raged for a year, killing hundreds and leaving many families displaced.The Tebu and Tuareg eventually struck a peace agreement, and a neutral militia currently keeps the peace in Ubari, but tensions remain. In November, Turkish engineers working at the city power station were kidnapped by unidentified gunmen, as was a Pakistani engineer at the station who went missing this month, according to local news media reports.While some Tebu groups have allied with the United Nations-backed government in Tripoli, Tuareg factions have allied with Qaeda, which is also believed to have profited from the trade in smuggled fuel.In the statement on Saturday, Robyn M. Mack, a spokeswoman for the United States Africa Command, said that it was still assessing the results of the strike and that the purpose had been “to deny terrorists freedom of action and degrade their ability to reconsolidate.”But the command did not answer several other questions: Who were the two dead militants, and why were they important enough to kill with an airstrike? What role, if any, did France play in a region of Libya in which it has also conducted counterterrorism operations? And, most significantly, to what extent is the attack the start of an escalating campaign against a broad spectrum of extremists in northwestern Africa, or a one-off strike against high-profile Qaeda operatives?“Beginning a concerted strike campaign against AQIM or other AQ elements in the Sahel, akin to what we are doing in Yemen and Somalia, would mark a significant expansion of our counterterrorism efforts,” said Luke Hartig, a former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council during the Obama administration.“If this is going to be the start of a broader campaign, it would be helpful to hear more from the administration about the threat posed by AQIM and why it merits putting our people in harm’s way and conducting strikes,” Mr. Hartig said.A senior French security official said France had played no role in the strike, but added that Paris was “very happy of this continued commitment of the U.S. to counterterrorism in Libya.”Questions about whether the American military, under the Trump administration, is seeking to blur the expanding scope of operations in Africa were raised this month when it was revealed that the United States had carried out four airstrikes in Libya between September and January that Africa Command did not disclose at the time. The military has said it will acknowledge such missions if asked about them, even if it does not affirmatively disclose them in a news release.Ms. Mack said that Saturday’s attack was the first airstrike the United States had conducted against Al Qaeda in Libya. In fact, the United States conducted an airstrike in eastern Libya in June 2015 against Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the mastermind of the 2013 terrorist seizure of an Algerian gas plant that left 38 foreign hostages dead. Mr. Belmokhtar was a longtime Qaeda operative with ties to senior Qaeda leadership in Pakistan. Western intelligence officials today remain divided over whether he is dead.American efforts to hunt down Islamists in Libya’s vast deserts rely heavily on surveillance and airpower but also on alliances with the armed groups vying for control of Libya. Mohamed El Sallak, a spokesman for the United Nations-backed unity government, said on Twitter that the attack in Ubari on Saturday was part of the “strategic cooperation between Libya and the United States in the fight against terrorism.”But in Ubari, armed Tebu and Tuareg groups have sided with different sides in Libya’s chaotic struggle, and the unity government is by no means the dominant player.Some control a stretch of southern border, while others have allied with militias from the coastal cities of Misurata and Benghazi. The rising force now in the south is Field Marshal Khalifa Hifter, the commander of the Libyan National Army based in Benghazi.Since his forces ousted the last Islamist militias from Benghazi in December, Mr. Hifter has focused on the south, where he exerts influence through his fleet of aging warplanes and alliances with local armed groups.In Sebha, the largest southern city, Mr. Hifter and the rival United Nations-backed government are vying for control through local proxies. In Ubari, 110 miles to the west, Mr. Hifter has allied with an ethnically mixed militia that is composed of former Qaddafi loyalists and more recent recruits.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/us/politics/guns-midterms-republicans.html","The passionate gun control rallies Saturday that brought out large crowds around the country sent a vivid signal that the issue is likely to play a major role in the 2018 midterm elections, and that Republicans could find themselves largely on the defensive on gun issues for the first time in decades.The gun debate could play out very differently in House and Senate races, as Republicans strain to save suburban congressional districts where gun control is popular, and Democrats defend Senate seats in red states where the Second Amendment is sacrosanct.But, in a year of extraordinary political intensity, and in the first national election of the Trump presidency, Republican and Democratic leaders say the gun issue appears to have become a potent rallying point for voters opposed to Mr. Trump and fed up with what they see as Washington’s indifference to mass shootings. The scale of demonstrations over the weekend was reminiscent of the Women’s March, earlier in Mr. Trump’s presidency, and underscored the intense energy of activists on the left ahead of the fall campaign.The commitment of the young march organizers to keep the issue front and center makes it unlikely to fade before November. But they are certain to face considerable resistance from pro-gun forces, particularly the National Rifle Association, which has formidable financial resources at its disposal and a long record of successfully mobilizing conservatives and helping win elections.Still, Republicans have already been struggling to keep their footing in densely populated suburbs where Mr. Trump is unpopular and the N.R.A. is an object of widespread scorn. The gun issue appears likely to deepen Republicans’ problems in these areas, further cleaving moderate, pocketbook-minded suburban voters from the party’s more hard-line rural base and raising the risks for Republicans in swing House districts around the country.Gun control may be a complicated issue for Democrats, too, because of the makeup of the Senate races on the ballot in November. If Democrats have a path to capturing the House through mainly moderate, well-educated districts, they are also defending Senate seats in strongly conservative states, like West Virginia and North Dakota, and in Republican-leaning states like Missouri and Indiana, where pro-gun positions have long been safe political terrain.But several prominent Republicans warned on Sunday that the party could end up alienating groups that tend to vote for candidates to the right of center if they are seen as unresponsive to the rising outcry around guns. In an atmosphere of frustration with Washington, inaction on guns could add to voters’ anger at entrenched lawmakers there.Gov. John Kasich, Republican of Ohio, warned in a CNN interview on Sunday that voters “do want changes” on gun policy and Republicans were ignoring them at their peril.“People should absolutely be held accountable at the ballot box,” said Mr. Kasich, a critic of Mr. Trump who is contemplating a run for president in 2020.It is not only the Republican Party’s dwindling moderate wing that sees danger in the gun issue. Dan Eberhart, an energy executive and major conservative donor, said Republicans risked driving away suburban voters if they did not do more to defy the N.R.A.Mr. Eberhart pointed to Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican with an A-plus N.R.A. rating for supporting the organization’s agenda. Mr. Scott, who is contemplating a bid for the Senate seat held by the Democrat Bill Nelson, signed incremental new gun regulations after last month’s shooting in Parkland, Fla., over the N.R.A.’s objections.“Republicans are going to have to move a little to get 51 percent-plus in elections, and the N.R.A. will have to deal with it,” Mr. Eberhart said. “The N.R.A. is really out of step with suburban G.O.P. voters.”While Democrats have little hope the demonstrations will lead quickly to legislation, they predict the broad-based outpouring of protest will increase pressure on Republicans. Addressing reporters on Sunday, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader and Democrat of New York, said even Republicans in the “stranglehold” of the N.R.A. must be “smelling the change in the air.”“This wasn’t Democrats only,” Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii, said of the protests. “This was people just sick and tired of a ruling party that refuses to take action on something so morally urgent.”Public opinion polls show powerful support for a range of gun measures, with overwhelming support for stricter background checks for gun purchasers and a smaller majority favoring an outright ban on assault-style weapons. A Fox News poll conducted last week found that three in five voters supported a ban on military-style weapons, while about nine in 10 supported universal background checks.But the same poll found scant optimism among voters that Congress would act in accordance with their preferences: Only about a fifth of voters thought it was highly likely Congress would act.The doubters are probably correct: There is relatively little time left on the congressional calendar this year, and the Republicans who control the House and Senate have shown no great appetite for tackling gun control. The $1.3 trillion spending bill that Mr. Trump signed on Friday included modest school safety measures and improvements to the background-checks system, but it did not include a number of more ambitious and popular measures, like raising the age requirement for purchasers of assault weapons.And while the Justice Department announced last week that it would try to follow through on a promise to ban so-called bump stocks through regulation, Mr. Trump has not indicated that he intends to take any further executive action to address the issue.Against a backdrop of plodding debate in Washington, a number of Democratic candidates in important races have already made prominent appeals to voters on the issue of gun violence, combining support for new gun restrictions with rhetorical denunciations of the N.R.A.Several of the Democrats campaigning most assertively on firearm regulation are also competing in areas recently afflicted by gun massacres. In Nevada, Steve Sisolak, a leading Democratic candidate for governor, vowed in his first television commercial to “take on the N.R.A.” A member of the Clark County Commission, which includes Las Vegas, Mr. Sisolak was among the most visible officials responding to the mass shooting in October, which left 58 people dead and hundreds wounded.Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democratic congressional candidate in South Florida, in a district not far from Parkland, said voters were fired up because of their horror at mass shootings and their outrage at congressional inaction.“This is a symbol of everything that is wrong right now, that is happening in Washington, D.C.,” said Ms. Mucarsel-Powell, who is challenging Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Miami Republican.Ms. Mucarsel-Powell, who marched against gun violence in Key West on Saturday, has aired commercials describing her personal experience with gun violence: When she was 24, her father was shot and killed in Ecuador.Other Democrats have been more timid on gun issues, particularly in more rural and heavily white, working-class districts where broad gun rights are more popular. When Democrats won an upset victory in a Pennsylvania special election  this month, in a heavily conservative congressional district outside Pittsburgh, they did so by nominating a distinctly moderate candidate, Conor Lamb, who favored improving the background checks system but did not back other popular gun restrictions.Val DiGiorgio, the chairman of the Pennsylvania Republican Party, said that while Democrats won that special election, the race had shown “the passion of Second Amendment supporters.” But Mr. DiGiorgio said voters were also seeking remedies for gun violence.“It’s clear that Americans on all sides of the debate are looking for solutions,” Mr. DiGiorgio said.But the energy in the Democratic base is with those who favor gun restrictions.While the colorful signs and pleading speeches of the students drew attention on Saturday, state and local Democratic parties across the country also used the marches to register voters and sign up volunteers.In Florida, volunteers circulated at protests in over 30 cities, passing out “commit to vote” cards that the party can later use for voter turnout purposes. And in Virginia, Democrats descended on the cities where buses were departing to the Washington march to register voters.The efforts were not confined to large liberal and swing states. In Columbia, S.C., the local Democratic Party used the march in the state’s capital to sign up voters for what could be a competitive governor’s race this fall. The liberal group Indivisible also used the protests to kick off a campaign pressuring members of Congress during the legislative recess.Jim Hobart, a Republican pollster, said the marches illustrated the enormous energy of the Democratic base and revealed generational changes in the electorate that Republicans will have to grapple with.“As we have seen in special elections, Democratic enthusiasm is already very high and the gun issue just adds to that,” Mr. Hobart said, noting that students in his hometown Atlanta had traveled by bus for 10 hours to join the march in Washington. “These same students are much more likely to not just vote, but volunteer.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/us/politics/students-lead-huge-rallies-for-gun-control-across-the-us.html","WASHINGTON — Standing before vast crowds from Washington to Los Angeles to Parkland, Fla., the speakers — nearly all of them students, some still in elementary school — delivered an anguished and defiant message: They are “done hiding” from gun violence, and will “stop at nothing” to get politicians to finally prevent it.The students, as they seized the nation’s attention on Saturday with raised fists and tear-streaked faces, vowed that their grief about school shootings and their frustration with adults’ inaction would power a new generation of political activism.“If they continue to ignore us, to only pretend to listen, then we will take action where it counts,” Delaney Tarr, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, where a gunman killed 17 people last month, told tens of thousands rallying in Washington. “We will take action every day in every way until they simply cannot ignore us any more.”For many of the young people, the Washington rally, called March for Our Lives, was their first act of protest and the beginning of a political awakening. But that awakening may be a rude one — lawmakers in Congress have largely disregarded their pleas for action on television and social media in the five weeks since the Parkland shooting.That reality helped drive the Parkland survivors in Washington, as they led a crowd that filled blocks of Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House and Capitol Hill. Thousands more rallied at about 800 “sibling” marches around the country and abroad, where students, like those in the capital, made eloquent calls for gun control and pledged to exercise their newfound political power in the midterm elections this fall.Aerial video captured seas of people — in front of Trump International Hotel in New York; in a central square in Tokyo; along the streets of Boston; at a rally in downtown Fort Worth, Tex.; and crammed into a park less than a mile from Stoneman Douglas High.Delivered in soaring speeches, emotional chants and hand-painted signs, the protesters’ messages offered angry rebukes to the National Rifle Association and politicians who have left gun laws largely intact for decades. A sign in Washington declared “Graduations, not funerals!” while another in New York said “I should be learning, not protesting.” Crowds in Chicago chanted “Fear has no place in our schools” as they marched.Celebrities, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, the “Hamilton” star, and the pop singers Ariana Grande and Miley Cyrus, performed in Washington, where politicians and adult activists were largely sidelined in favor of the fresh-faced students offering stories of fear and frustration, but also hope for change.The most powerful, and impassioned, moments came from the surviving students of the Parkland shooting, who declared themselves angry, impatient and determined to stop the slaughter.“Today, we march,” Ms. Tarr said. “We fight. We roar. We prepare our signs. We raise them high. We know what we want, we know how to get it and we are not waiting any more.”An 11-year-old girl from Virginia, Naomi Wadler, captivated her audience as she declared “Never again!” on behalf of black women and girls who have been the victims of gun violence.Calls like Naomi’s stood in stark contrast to action on Capitol Hill and at the White House in the hours before the rallies. President Trump signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill that took no significant new steps on gun control: It did nothing to expand background checks, impose additional limits on assault weapons, require a higher age for rifle purchases or curb the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines.The spending legislation, which was viewed as the last opportunity this year for Congress to enact major new gun restrictions before the midterm elections in November, included only some school safety measures and modest improvements to the background check system.Organizers at national gun control groups, who provided logistical support and public relations advice as the students planned the Washington rally, said they believed that the students would not become disillusioned by the lack of immediate action in Congress. They noted that rallies took place in 390 of the country’s 435 congressional districts.“The mass shooting generation is nearing voting age,” said John Feinblatt, the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a national group that advocates tougher gun laws. “They know the midterms are six months away, and they plan to make sure that they vote and they get others to register to vote. They are absolutely poised to turn this moment into a movement.”Gun rights organizations largely stayed silent on Saturday, following vigorous efforts since the Parkland shooting to squash any movement toward significant gun control legislation. A spokesman for the N.R.A. declined repeated requests for comment.On the eve of the march, Colion Noir, a host on NRATV, an online video channel produced by the gun group, lashed out at the Parkland students, saying that “no one would know your names” if someone with a weapon had stopped the gunman at their school.“These kids ought to be marching against their own hypocritical belief structures,” he said in the video, adding: “The only reason we’ve ever heard of them is because the guns didn’t come soon enough.”Small counterprotests took place in a few cities. In Salt Lake City, several hundred people gathered near a high school, some carrying signs with messages like “AR-15’s EMPOWER the people.” Brandon McKee, who wore a pistol on his belt, brought his daughter, Kendall, 11, who held a sign that said “Criminals love gun control.”“I believe it’s their goal to unarm America, and that’s why we’re here today,” Mr. McKee said of the Washington marchers. In Boston, about 20 protesters favoring gun control confronted a small clutch of Second Amendment supporters in front of the State House. The two sides quickly got into a shouting match.The pro-gun protests were swamped in size and enthusiasm by those marching for gun control, many of whom traveled for many hours to attend the rallies in cities across the country. Sebastian Jennings, 18, said he spent 36 hours taking a bus to Washington from western Arkansas. Tour buses lined the streets.Security was tight in Washington, where military trucks and guards blocked almost every intersection near the rally amid a huge police presence, and in other cities where marches and rallies forced the closing of major roads.In towns like Dahlonega, Ga., smaller rallies sought to demonstrate a desire for new gun restrictions even in rural, Republican-leaning communities where gun ownership is common and support for the Second Amendment is strong.“We’re going to be the generation that takes down the gun lobby,” Marisa Pyle, 20, said through a red megaphone to a group of several hundred people gathered in front of the Dahlonega Gold Museum.Around the world, Americans living abroad gathered to honor those who have died in school shootings and to echo the call for gun control.Protesters in Rome jammed the sidewalk across from the American Embassy, next to the upscale Via Veneto, raising their voice in chants — “Hey hey, ho ho, the N.R.A. has got to go,” and waving signs with messages like “A gun is not fun” and “Am I next?” many made by high school students at an international school.About 150 to 200 people in Berlin gathered in solidarity in front of the Brandenburg Gate, just steps from the American Embassy. Many carried hand-painted signs, among them: “Arms should be for hugging,” “Bullets aren’t school supplies” and “Waffeln statt Waffen” (Waffles instead of weapons).One of the largest rallies outside Washington was at a Florida park not far from Stoneman Douglas High School. During that event, 17 students from the school silently took the stage to represent their friends who had been killed.Anthony Montalto, the brother of Gina Rose Montalto, one of those killed, held a sign that said: “My sister could not make it here today. I’m here for her.”“Turn this moment into a movement,” Sari Kaufman, a sophomore at Stoneman Douglas, implored the sea of students, parents and teachers. She urged her classmates to vote out of office politicians who receive money from the N.R.A. “They think we’re all talk and no action.”But the largest rally, by far, was in Washington, where stage risers and giant television monitors were set up in the shadow of the Capitol — the focus of much of the anger from students throughout the day.One protester carried a sign that said “If the opposite of pro is con, then the opposite of progress is Congress.”Most Republican and Democratic members of Congress had already left the city to return to their home districts for spring break. Mr. Trump spent Saturday afternoon in Florida, at the Trump International Golf Club, less than an hour north of Parkland. A White House spokeswoman said in a statement, “We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today.”City officials had prepared for the biggest march since about a half-million women gathered on the day after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, declaring a new political movement aimed at resisting the president and his policies.On Saturday, officials with Metro, the region’s subway system, said more than 207,000 rides had been taken on the system by 1 p.m., about half of the number by that time during the Women’s March.A team of crowd science researchers led by G. Keith Still of Manchester Metropolitan University in England estimated that about 180,000 people attended the rally. They examined photographs, video and satellite imagery to estimate the crowd density in different areas of the demonstration. The number is less than half of the 470,000 that Dr. Still estimated had attended the Women’s March in Washington in 2017.Even so, the streets of Washington were packed on Saturday. Teenagers climbed on each other’s shoulders to reach the bare limbs of trees, where they climbed higher. And each student who spoke drew a cheer that matched, and even eclipsed, the applause given to the musical performers.Edna Chavez, 17, a high school senior from Los Angeles, said she had lost her brother to gun violence: “He was in high school when he passed away. It was a day like any other day. Sunset down on South Central. You hear pops, thinking they’re fireworks.”“Ricardo was his name. Can you all say it with me?” she asked. The crowd said his name over and over again, as Ms. Chavez smiled through tears.Naomi Wadler, the 11-year-old student, introduced herself with a soft “hi” and said she represented the black women who have been victims of gun violence.“People have said that I am too young to have these thoughts on my own,” she said. “People have said that I am a tool of some nameless adult. It’s not true. My friends and I might still be 11, and we might still be in elementary school, but we know.”She added, “And we know that we have seven short years until we, too, have the right to vote.”

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/26/596966272/us-expels-dozens-of-russian-diplomats-closes-consulate-in-seattle","Updated 11:53 a.m. ETPresident Trump ordered the expulsion of 60 Russian officials from the United States and ordered the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle, the White House announced Monday.The move follows the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, in the English city of Salisbury on March 4.The Trump administration is calling all of the 60 Russians spies working under the cover of diplomatic roles. They and their families are being given seven days to leave the U.S. Of the 60 officers being expelled, 48 are members of the Russian Embassy and 12 are officers from Russia's mission to the United Nations in New York.The consulate in Seattle is being shuttered because of its proximity to a U.S. submarine base and Boeing's operations there, a senior administration official said. The consulate must be close by April 2.""The United States takes this action in conjunction with our NATO allies, and partners around the world in response with Russia's use of a military grade chemical weapon on the soil of the United Kingdom — the latest in its ongoing pattern of destabilizing activities around the world,"" the official said.""Today's actions make the United States safer by reducing Russia's ability to spy on Americans, and to conduct covert operations that threaten America's national security,"" the official continued. ""With these steps, the United States and our allies and partners make clear to Russia that its actions have consequences.""Reuters reports that Russia's ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, called the U.S. decision to expel Russian diplomats ""wrongful"" and said it was harming already weak U.S.-Russian ties, according to the RIA news agency.The Russian news agency also quoted a member of the upper house of the Russian parliament as saying that Russia would expel at least 60 staff from U.S. diplomatic missions in the country, Reuters reports.The expulsions come amid internal conflict at the White House and State Department on how to handle Russia. Last week, Trump congratulated Vladimir Putin on his re-election as president and did not bring up Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign nor Russia's hacking of the U.S. power grid. But Trump is also bringing in John Bolton, a Russia hawk, as his national security adviser. The U.S. has also instituted more sanctions against Russia.Many European countries made the same move on Monday. Germany, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Estonia, Italy, Poland and Lithuania all announced that they would be asking Russian diplomats to leave.The German foreign ministry said in a statement that ""the expulsion of four diplomats is a strong signal of solidarity with Great Britain and signals the resolve of the Germany government not to leave attacks against our closest partners and allies unanswered,"" The Associated Press reports.Britain insists it has proof that Russia was behind the nerve-gas poisoning of the Skripals, who remain in critical condition. A police officer who assisted them has been released from the hospital. Traces of the Soviet-era nerve agent called novichok were found in a pub and an Italian restaurant that the Skripals visited, possibly exposing hundreds of people.British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement, ""We welcome today's actions by our allies, which clearly demonstrate that we all stand shoulder to shoulder in sending the strongest signal to Russia that it cannot continue to flout international law.""May said it was the largest mass expulsion of Russian diplomats in history.NPR's Joanna Kakissis contributed to this report."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/26/595231728/why-trump-appointees-refer-to-optics-when-discussing-spending-scandals","The way some of President Trump's Cabinet officials tell it, their recent negative headlines haven't been about difficulties complying with federal ethics laws, but rather about ""the optics.""Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, in a House committee's hot seat last month after taking his wife on a government-funded trip to Europe, said, ""I do recognize the optics of this are not good. I accept the responsibility for that.""Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colo., questioning Shulkin, snapped back: ""It's not the optics that are not good. It's the facts that are not good.""The optics versus the facts. That's the problem.""I wonder whether there is actually ethics blindness on the part of the Trump Administration — because it's not just a problem of optics, it's a problem of ethics,"" said Kathleen Clark, a professor of legal and governmental ethics at Washington University law school in St. Louis.Another Trump Cabinet official under fire for questionable spending, Housing and Urban Affairs secretary Ben Carson, told lawmakers he was not responsible for the picking out a $31,000 custom dining set for his office. ""I left it to my wife,"" said Carson.Whatever the reason, President Trump's administration prefers to deal with appearances, as do many others in Washington.""The optics in some of this don't look good, and that's why we, again, have taken this criticism to heart,"" Tom Price told Fox News last fall, as his frequent use of charter jets was about to prematurely end his tenure as Health and Human Services secretary.Trump, hinting to reporters that Price was on his way out, said, ""Look, I think he's a very fine person. I certainly don't like the optics.""Public apologies contain three essential elements, said Edwin Battistella, author of Sorry About That: The Language of Public Apology.""In a sort of sincere, full apology,"" Battistella, who's a professor of linguistics at Southern Oregon University, told NPR, ""someone would name what they did wrong and take responsibility for it, and talk about how they're going to be a better person in the future or fix what they did wrong.""President Ronald Reagan hit all of those points in a 1987 speech while apologizing for the Iran-Contra scandal, which involved American hostages in Iran, clandestine U.S. arms sales to Iran, and the illegal diversion of money from the sales to anti-communist guerrillas in Nicaragua. The scandal nearly caused a constitutional crisis.Starting with a broad initial apology — ""First, let me say I take full responsibility for my own actions and for those of my administration"" — Reagan apologized nine times in the 12-minute speech.By comparison, Battistella said, regretting the optics is just an updated way to avoid the real subject. ""I'm sorry if you were offended. It's a new way of saying that.""Then there's the non-apology for the ages from President Bill Clinton in 1997: ""Mistakes were made here, by people who either did it deliberately or inadvertently."" He was trying to defuse the Democrats' big fundraising scandal in his 1996 re-election campaign, and the party's bungled response to it.""Mistakes were made"" is a time-honored way to insulate the speaker from the sin. Battistella said, ""It actually shows up in Ulysses Grant's final state of the union address.""The document, officially called the President's Eighth Annual Message to Congress, came in December 1876, when President Grant's administration had been ground down by eight years of scandal.Grant was known for his blunt prose. In his message to Congress, he took the non-apology and added seven important words: ""Mistakes have been made, as all can see and I admit.""Grant didn't mention any optics."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/25/596868354/stormy-daniels-shares-graphic-details-about-alleged-affair-with-trump","Updated at 10:50 a.m. ET on MondayIn Stephanie Clifford's much anticipated first television appearance since the story of her alleged affair with President Trump began dominating news cycles, the adult film actress also known as Stormy Daniels shared graphic details and said she signed a non-disclosure agreement to keep quiet about the encounter because she felt threatened.Daniels appeared on CBS' 60 Minutes, and walked Anderson Cooper through her side of her experience with Trump, beginning with an encounter at a golf tournament in 2006 in which Daniels playfully swatted Trump on the behind with a magazine he had been holding that had his face on the cover.""From that moment on, he was a completely different person,"" Daniels said. ""He was like, 'Wow, you — you are special. You remind me of my daughter.' You know — he was like, 'You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you.'""Daniels said she had sex with Trump, despite not wanting to or being physically attracted to him, because she felt trapped once she went back to his hotel room alone. Daniels was 27 years old at the time, and Trump was 60.Still, Daniels made it clear she didn't consider herself ""a victim"" and that the sex was ""consensual."" Trump did not wear a condom, she said.The two stayed in touch after that, but did not have sex again, Daniels said.Trump has repeatedly denied that he ever had an affair with Daniels. It's unclear whether he watched the interview; but he has been known to watch 60 Minutes. Trump was in Washington when it aired, although First Lady Melania Trump remained in Florida.While he didn't acknowledge the interview, on Monday morning Trump again criticized the media in a tweet.Daniels also detailed her efforts to talk about the affair publicly.In 2011, after agreeing to give an interview to a tabloid magazine for $15,000, Daniels says a man approached her in Las Vegas.""I was in a parking lot, going to a fitness class with my infant daughter. Taking, you know, the seats facing backwards in the backseat, diaper bag, you know, gettin' all the stuff out. And a guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,' Daniels said. ""And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.""More recently, Daniels and her attorney Michael Avenatti, have been fighting to void the non-disclosure agreement Daniels agreed to, that involved a $130,000 payment from Trump attorney Michael Cohen, in the days leading up to the 2016 election. Daniels filed a civil suit in California earlier this month claiming the agreement is invalid on the grounds that Trump never signed it.The alleged affair happened a decade ago, leading some critics to question why it's relevant now. But the Campaign Legal Center's Larry Noble says the fact that Cohen paid Daniels just days before the 2016 election could be evidence that the ""election was on their mind"" and that the money could be considered funds spent as to boost the campaign, and therefore subject to campaign finance laws.""What [Trump] did as a private citizen is not relevant to the campaign finance laws,"" Noble told NPR's Lulu Garcia Navarro. ""What he did as a candidate and what the campaign did in terms of paying somebody not to talk about what he did may be relevant to the campaign finance laws.""Trump and Cohen had dinner together Saturday night, according to The New York Times' Maggie Haberman.Daniels is one of two women suing to speak freely about past relationships with Trump.Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, filed suit last week to break an agreement she made with American Media Inc., the parent company of The National Enquirer, for the rights to tell the story of her alleged 10-month affair with Trump.And in an unrelated case, a New York state Supreme Court judge ruled recently that a defamation case involving the president and a former contestant on The Apprentice who claims he sexually harassed her can move forward in state court, as NPR's Vanessa Romo reported.On Monday, CBS said the Daniels interview on 60 Minutes had the best ratings since the Nov. 16, 2008 episode — when then President-elect Obama and his wife Michelle appeared on the show to give their first post-election interview."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/25/596830601/more-upheaval-for-trumps-special-counsel-legal-team-digenova-out-before-beginnin","Not even a week has passed since it was announced that Fox News firebrand Joseph diGenova was joining President Trump's special counsel legal team to help address the FBI probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Fast forward five days and diGenova and his lawyer wife, Victoria Toensing, are out before they even got in.""The President is disappointed that conflicts prevent Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing from joining the President's Special Counsel legal team,"" Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow said in a statement Sunday. ""However, those conflicts do not prevent them from assisting the President in other legal matters The President looks forward to working with them.""The law firm diGenova runs with Toensing also represents two other people caught up in the Mueller investigation, Mark Corallo and Sam Clovis, which would present a conflict of interest, reports NPR's Tamara Keith.DiGenova, a former U.S. attorney, has been a staunch Trump defender, using his Fox News appearances to slam the Russia investigation.In January, he said the probe amounted ""a brazen plot ... to frame Donald Trump with a false crime, because they didn't think he should be president.""The New York Times reports that Trump himself may have felt diGenova and Toensing were not the right fit, after having met with them recently: ""According to two people told of details about the meeting, the president did not believe he had personal chemistry with Mr. diGenova and Ms. Toensing.""Earlier in the week, news reports emerged that Trump's legal team had approached well-respected Republican lawyer Ted Olson about getting him on board but was turned down. His firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher reportedly felt there were too many client conflicts related to the Russia probe.Ted Boutros, a partner in the firm, confirmed Tuesday that Olson would not be representing Trump.On Sunday, Trump addressed the tumult, defending the desirability of representing him.""Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case...don't believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted,"" he tweeted.He added, ""I am very happy with my existing team.""But that team is dwindling.On Thursday, John Dowd, the lawyer who had been heading Trump's outside team addressing the Russia probe resigned.A source told NPR's Tamara Keith that Dowd had expressed concern about diGenova's hiring because of his firm's representation of Clovis and Corallo.Tamara also reports, ""a source familiar with Dowd's thinking says he was tired and frustrated, in a draining job with not enough resources and with a client who was not taking his advice. When reached by phone all Dowd would say is, 'I love the president and wish him well.'""Dowd's resignation came three days after Trump launched a Twitter attack against Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia investigation.While Trump has long slammed the probe as a ""witch hunt,"" the tweet was the first time he named Mueller in his criticism."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/25/564580736/more-states-move-to-end-tampon-tax-that-s-seen-as-discriminating-against-women","ChapStick, Viagra and dandruff shampoo. These are just three of the thousands of health and personal care items that are exempt from sales tax in many U.S. states. Notably missing from that list: menstrual products. So far, nine states have exempted menstrual products from their sales tax, and seven have introduced legislation aimed at doing the same. Three of the seven — Nebraska, Virginia and Arizona — introduced their legislation this year.In her recently published book, Periods Gone Public,  Jennifer Weiss-Wolf chronicles what she calls a lack of ""period equity."" Managing menstruation ""is a critical aspect of the lives and civic participation of more than half the population,"" and should be considered when making policy, she writes.A large part of her advocacy has focused on fighting against what's known as the ""tampon tax."" It's just one example of women paying a premium for various products, a phenomenon known as the ""pink tax."" While there is no specific tax on tampons, in states that don't tax medical and health supplies, tampons are excluded from those tax-exempt categories. Hence the term ""tampon tax.""  According to Weiss-Wolf, the tampon tax was a natural starting place for her advocacy. She began working on the issue of period equity at the beginning of 2015, and the following year she teamed up with Laura Strausfeld, a lawyer looking to combat the tampon tax. Together they formed the aptly named Period Equity, an organization that works on legal cases and legislation across the country meant to combat the tampon tax. Period Equity's most recent undertaking was a public service ad starring celebrity Amber Rose, which was released on YouTube. Rose, clad in a provocative black dress, carefully strokes a diamond pendent and opens the charm to reveal a single tampon. ""Where else would you keep something 36 states tax as a luxury?"" the voice-over asks in an unabashed tone. Minnesota, Illinois, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, Connecticut and Florida have all outlawed the tampon tax. Four of the states — New York, Illinois, Connecticut and Florida — have made this change just in the last two years. They are the early adopters of a policy change that seems to get more popular each day.At least one company has taken on this issue head on. Boxed, an online bulk shopping company, introduced its #RethinkPink initiative, offering a discount on menstrual products to offset states sales taxes.Of course, the company stands to gain customers from this initiative. If more women choose to shop with Boxed because of the discounts, they end up buying other goods on its website, making up for the initial loss in revenue. Nitasha Mehta is the head of vendor marketing for the company and lobbies around the country, including Nevada and Ohio, where she testified in support of anti-tampon-tax bills. ""There is a trend starting to occur,"" she says.In Ohio, state Rep. Brigid Kelly, a Democrat, recently earned a major win for the legislation in a Republican-dominated statehouse. Her bill, which would exempt feminine hygiene products from the state sales tax, was introduced in February 2017 and was given a second hearing last fall. ""We were so happy,"" she says. ""This is a very simple practical thing that we can do in order to make necessary medical products more accessible to women in our community.""Kelly says she received help from lawmakers in other states, including New York and California, that dealt with similar legislation. One main talking point among many of these fights across the country is how much of an impact this change could make for low-income women. ""The sales tax on these items does not amount to much,"" Kelly says. ""But when you're trying to figure out if you can give your kid milk money or if you have enough to get your own lunch then it is impactful in a very significant way.""She acknowledges it's not a comfortable topic for discussion with her male colleagues. Kelly says they've been professional, but ""it's definitely not something they are eager to discuss over the lunch table""In some states the bill was circulated but not passed or signed. California Gov. Jerry Brown refused to sign the measure on the grounds that the state couldn't afford to lose revenue. In her new book about period equity, Weiss-Wolf estimates the revenue from menstrual products can range from ""$1 million in Utah to $20 million in California."" ""A lot of times they don't want to pass it because it's a budget issue ... they're in debt,"" Boxed's Mehta says. But, she says, ""ultimately by saving women money on these items hopefully they will spend it on other items and have more disposable income.""In Nevada, a version passed last year is awaiting approval by the state's voters in a referendum scheduled for this November.Similar legislation was introduced last year in Wisconsin, where it is awaiting a hearing. And so far in 2018, three more states have introduced anti-tampon tax legislation: Nebraska, Virginia and Arizona. In the latest attempt to pass the measure in Utah, the bill died in committee earlier this year.""The tampon tax is an obvious example of unfair gender discrimination,"" says Virginia Delegate Kaye Kory, a Democrat. ""It doesn't make sense."" Kory's bill to end the tampon tax did not get a hearing in the legislative session that ended this month, but she plans to reintroduce it. The pink taxThere is another seemingly unfair ""tax"" targeted at women: the pink tax. It's actually not a tax at all, but a charge tacked onto many women's products. A 2015 study by the New York Department of Consumer Affairs compared nearly 800 retail items from over 90 brands ranging from children's toys to deodorant, specifically in search of potential gendered pricing. For any given product, the ""women's"" version costs an average of 7 percent more than similar products for men, the study found. Of the 35 product categories tested, only five did not price higher for the women's version. Personal care products topped the list at an average of 13 percent more for women. Even something as universal as a bike helmet at Target cost $14.99 with sharks on it and $27.99 with unicorns on it, according to the 2015 study.Some industry officials push back against these claims. ""Retailers see women as their biggest target,"" Ted Potrikus, CEO of the Retail Council of New York State, told USA Today. ""Research and development, following trends, meeting trends, advertising products on television and in magazines are not cheap."" But other advocates say this is a misguided approach to advertising women's products, and may be due to women's underrepresentation in the advertising field. Although women have been a part of advertising since its conception, The New York Times reported that only 11 percent of creative directors are women.One example of this would be the old advertising strategy ""shrink it and pink it."" This phrase refers to the popular marketing strategy of taking a men's or gender-neutral product, reducing the size of the packaging, and turning the bottle pink to target women, and then charging the same price or more than the comparable product. Although this idea may seem arcane, there is evidence to suggest some manufactures are still doing it.And this discriminatory pricing also applies to services, advocates say.""I find it offensive,"" says Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., who has a long history of standing up for women's economic rights. In 1995, Speier, a state representative in California at the time, led the historic successful push in the state to outlaw discriminatory pricing for haircuts, dry cleaning, car repairs and other services based on gender. Now she aims to do the same at the federal level, with a bill tentatively titled the Pink Tax Repeal Act. This bill, which she plans to introduce in the U.S. House later this year, will aim to restrict discriminatory pricing of services as well as goods. She says many of her colleagues in the House didn't know such a disparity exists. ""People are just astonished,"" she says. Passing the legislation in the current political climate will be difficult, she concedes. But if it passes, she says, the bill would provide wide-reaching authority to combat the pink tax. ""It allows the state attorneys general to bring civil actions on behalf of the residents of the state to compel compliance,"" in addition to the standard enforcement abilities of the Federal Trade Commission, she says.""It's a big lift to get it to move in this Congress,"" she says. ""But I think it's important to roll it out and it's important to have a discussion about it."""

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/26/florida-s-year-round-daylight-saving-law-raises-safety-concerns.html","TAMPA –  The Sunshine State is one step closer to being a little brighter every evening after passing a bill to enact year-round daylight saving time to boost the economy and tourism.After weeks of debate over guns, schools and budgets during the legislative session, Florida’s House and Senate members voted on something they could agree on: daylight.H.B. 1013, also known as the “Sunshine Protection Act,” would enact year-round daylight-saving time to improve the economy, public safety and mental health of Florida’s residents and visitors.“If you talk to people in the tourism world, they’ll tell you they’d much rather have daylight later because people after work would be able to go shopping, go to the beach, do things they want to do,” said State Sen. Greg Steube, R-Bradenton, who sponsored the Senate version of the bill.The bill has attracted widespread attention and public support, but it’s not a done deal yet. The issues?The federal government controls the nation’s time zones, as well as the start and end dates of daylight saving time. States can choose to exempt themselves from daylight saving time, take Arizona and Hawaii for example, but nothing in federal law allows them to exempt themselves from Standard Time.Because of this, even with Scott's signature on the bill, Congress would still have to exempt the state of Florida from the law.Steube says he isn’t worried because the bill is not partisan.“If there’s no real reason why we’re doing something so big like changing our clocks back and forth every year, twice a year, then I don’t know why we can’t change it,” he said.If approved by the federal government, Florida’s residents will move into the Atlantic Time Zone for part of the year, aligning cities from Jacksonville to Miami with Nova Scotia rather than New York and Washington, D.C. “I think it would be disruptive in that it would potentially cause confusion, particularly between interstate business enterprises,” said State Rep. Julio Gonzalez, R-Venice, who opposed the bill in the House.Scott announced last week that Florida set another tourism record by welcoming the highest number of tourists in the state’s history with 116.5 million people visiting in 2017.“Anything that we can do, whether it’s majorly substantive or minor, that can continue to boost those numbers is something that I’d be in favor of, obviously,” he said. “Our tourists are coming here to enjoy our beaches, they’re coming here to go on cruises, they’re coming here to do outdoor activities because of the weather, so I think having more daylight allows them to do more of the activities that they would want to do anyways.”Gonzalez says Florida doesn’t need the boost in tourism, adding “we accomplished all these wonderful improvements in our tourism numbers without adjusting our clock!”The idea of making daylight saving time year-round isn’t a new one. President Nixon attempted the change in 1974 to help alleviate an energy crisis but the consequences were immediate – and deadly.In less than a month, eight children died in traffic accidents in Florida, and six of the deaths were attributed directly to children going to school in darkness.“If it becomes that big of a problem, independent school districts can move the time of when they start school to be able to make sure our children are getting to school safely,” Steube said.Florida isn’t the only state considering the change either. Twenty-six other states want to adopt daylight saving time year-round, including New York and Massachusetts, but Florida would be the first and only state to exempt itself from Standard Time.“I honestly believe that more states will do it if Florida takes a leading role,” Steube said.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has announced his support for the bill and introduced legislation to standardize daylight saving time for the entire calendar year and try to make the change nationwide.“If we’re going do it in a national way…then I think my analysis would be different,” Gonzalez said. “I’m kind of curious myself to see which way it would go…I have no idea which way Congress will go with this.”Lawmakers in the Sunshine State say if Congress approves the exemption, time would change “as soon as practicable.”"
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/26/republicans-push-to-end-dems-stranglehold-on-key-ambassadorial-nominee.html","Senate Republicans fed up with the Democrats' refusal to allow confirmation votes on a slew of critical appointments - including the high-profile case of the Trump administration's first openly gay ambassadorial nominee – may move more aggressively to finally break the logjam.""It's time to end this partisan spectacle. We have 78 more nominees for various jobs who’ve made it through their committee hearings and are waiting for a vote on this floor,"" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said on the floor of the Senate last week. ""Most of these people have bipartisan support, they can be confirmed easily.""Barrasso wants to change a rule that allows for 30 hours of Senate discussion for each nominee, which Republicans say effectively allows Democrats to jam up the appointment process to a ridiculously slow crawl. Barrasso wants to limit the number of hours of discussion down to eight - a standard Democrats themselves supported under the Obama administration.The logjam holding up one particular nomination has attracted more attention in recent weeks, and may be contributing to the effort to change the rules. Richard Grenell, a conservative and experienced foreign policy expert who is openly gay, was nominated by Trump to be ambassador to Germany last year, but remains among those held up in the process.In response to the growing calls to approve Grenell, Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., last week went to the floor of the Senate and called for a unanimous voice consent to push the nomination through. But Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., objected, citing his objections to some comments Grenell, a former Fox News contributor, posted on his Twitter feed. According to Merkley, some of Grenell's tweets showed ""a complete disregard for the Senate confirmation process.""Grenell’s supporters have pushed back strongly on Merkley’s objections, and say Grenell’s tweets since he was nominated last fall have focused on foreign policy issues. His supporters have taken their case to twitter, through #confirmgrenell and other online efforts. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has also stepped up its effort to push through Grenell's nomination. Speaking at a White House press briefing last month, spokesperson Sarah Sanders cited the Democrats' ""historic obstruction"" in blocking that and the growing number of other nominations.""Mr. Grenell, a Harvard-educated experienced diplomat, was the longest-serving U.S. spokesperson at the United Nations. He was nominated in September of last year. He was reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee with bipartisan support. He is waiting to represent America's interest and be our country's top voice in a G-7 country,"" Sanders said.The “hyper-political delay on Mr. Grenell puts our national security and America's foreign policy interests in jeopardy,"" Sanders said. ""The Senate should move to confirm him immediately.""A range of foreign policy experts have also expressed their concern over the lack of a U.S. ambassador to Germany. The U.S.-Germany relationship is a critical one, particularly with the Berlin government's involvement in issues like the Iran nuclear deal, trade, and NATO security. The holdup of Grenell’s nomination has also irritated German politicians and the media.""America needs a voice in Germany!"" read the headline of a commentary piece by Florian von Heintze, the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of BILD. ""When the German-America relationship suffers, that damages Germany. We have no more an important ally in the world.” "
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/26/trump-orders-expulsion-dozens-russian-diplomats-closure-consulate-in-seattle.html","President Trump on Monday ordered the expulsion of 60 Russian intelligence officers in the United States and the closure of the Russian consulate in Seattle in response to the nerve agent attack on an ex-Russian spy in the U.K. earlier this month, senior administration officials said.The steps, following Britain's expulsion of Russian diplomats, are meant to send a message to Moscow that actions have consequences, the officials said. The Seattle consulate is being closed because of its proximity to submarine bases, as well as Boeing.“With these steps, the United States and our allies and partners make clear to Russia that its actions have consequences,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. “The United States stands ready to cooperate to build a better relationship with Russia, but this can only happen with a change in the Russian government’s behavior.”""We’ve said more than once and we say once again: Russia has had nothing to do with this affair whatsoever. Naturally, as before, we will proceed from the principle of reciprocity,"" Peskov said.""Today, the United States began the process of expelling 12 intelligence operatives from the Russian Mission to the United Nations who have abused their privilege of residence in the United States,"" UN Ambassador Nikki Haley said Monday. ""After a review, we have determined that the 12 intelligence operatives engaged in espionage activities that are adverse to‎ our national security."" Officials said the president made the decision after several intelligence meetings last week, and was continuously briefed about the process over the weekend.  The administration had said it was considering a range of “options” in response to the March 4 poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. They were apparently poisoned with a Soviet-produced, military-grade nerve agent and remain unconscious and in critical condition.At a summit in Brussels, the 28 EU leaders agreed with Britain that it is ""highly likely"" Russia is responsible for the attack on Skripal and his daughter, Yulia.TRUMP DEMANDS RUSSIA PROVIDE 'UNAMBIGUOUS ANSWERS' ON NERVE AGENT ATTACK IN UKTrump previously joined British Prime Minister Theresa May and the leaders of France and Germany in condemning the poisoning.""It is an assault on UK sovereignty and any such use by a state party is a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and a breach of international law. It threatens the security of us all,” they said in a joint statement.They also wrote “there is no plausible alternative explanation” for the attack and that the Kremlin’s failure to respond to a legitimate request for an explanation “further underlines its responsibility.""Russia has fiercely denied any involvement in the poisoning, saying that it had destroyed its chemical weapons and had no motive to kill Skripal, who was convicted of spying for Britain but released in a 2010 spy swap. Still, Moscow has in turn ordered 23 British diplomats to leave.The EU’s position follows May sharing with group leaders information about why Britain is convinced Moscow was behind the attack, including the type of poison used -- a Soviet-developed nerve agent known as Novichok -- and intelligence that Russia has produced it within the past decade.Fox News’ Joseph Weber, Nick Kalman, Rich Edson, John Roberts and Lucia Suarez and The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Forget the story.""The letter, which was also sent to Daniel’s attorney, Michael Avenatti, demanded that the actress refrain from making “false and defamatory statements” about Cohen in the future.Avenatti said, “Will this guy ever come clean with the American people or is he more interested in trying to role play Ray Donovan (badly)?”""He knows I'm telling the truth,"" said Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford. She does not allege that she was coerced in her encounter with Trump, saying, ""This is not a 'Me too.' I was not a victim.""Daniels received a $130,000 payment days before the 2016 presidential election for her silence and has sought to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement.The White House did not immediately comment Sunday on the interview. Trump, through his representatives, has denied the allegations.Cohen has said Trump never had an affair with Daniels. Cohen has said he paid the $130,000 out of his pocket. Cohen has said neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Daniels and he was not reimbursed for the payment.In the interview, Daniels described a sexual encounter with Trump that began with him talking about himself and showing her an issue of a magazine with his picture on the cover.She said she asked, ""Does this ... does this normally work for you?"" He was taken aback, she says. ""And I was like, 'Someone should take that magazine and spank you with it.'"" She says she then ordered him to drop his pants and, in a playful manner, ""I just gave him a couple swats.""She said they talked some more, although he quit talking about himself, and that she became more comfortable.""He was like, 'Wow, you — you are special. You remind me of my daughter.' You know — he was like, 'You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you.'""She said after dinner in Trump's room, they had sex. He didn't use a condom, she said, and she didn't ask him to. Afterward, he asked to see her again, she said.Daniels said that before they had sex Trump had broached the idea of her being a contestant on ""The Apprentice,"" and she likened it to a ""business opportunity.""She said he called her several times and would ask if they could get together again and that he had an update for her. She said she felt that he was dangling the opportunity to keep her coming back.""Of course. I mean, I'm not blind. But at the same time, maybe it'll work out, you know?"" Daniels said.In July 2007, a year after they had met, Daniels said Trump asked to meet with her privately at the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles. She said they did not have sex, but he wanted to.Daniels reported that Trump called her the following month to say he had not been able to get her a spot on his TV show. She said they never met again.Daniels was asked why she's talking now: ""Because it was very important to me to be able to defend myself,"" she said.Daniels said she was fine saying nothing at all. ""But I'm not OK with being made out to be a liar, or people thinking that I did this for money and people are like, 'Oh, you're an opportunist. You're taking advantage of this.'

""Did he mention his wife or child at all in this?"" Cooper said.""I asked. And he brushed it aside, said, 'Oh yeah, yeah, you know, don't worry about that. We don't even, we have separate rooms and stuff'"" Daniels said.The CBS interview came as Trump deals with allegations about his sexual exploits long before he ran for president.Former Playboy model Karen McDougal told Cooper in a CNN interview broadcast Thursday that her affair with Trump began at a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 2006. McDougal said she ended the relationship in 2007 out of guilt.McDougal has filed suit in Los Angeles seeking to invalidate a confidentiality agreement with American Media Inc., the company that owns the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer. It paid her $150,000 during the 2016 presidential election.The lawsuit alleges that McDougal was paid for the rights to her story of an affair, but the story never ran. It also alleges that Cohen was secretly involved in her discussions with American Media.Trump is also facing a New York defamation lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on ""The Apprentice."" Zervos has accused Trump of unwanted sexual contact in 2007 after she had appeared on the show with him, and sued after he dismissed the claims as made up.A judge ruled the lawsuit can move forward while the president is in office.Fox News' Kristin Brown and The Associated Press contributed to this report "
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/26/peter-morici-economy-stock-market-dont-have-me-panicking-heres-why.html","Sometimes the stock market gets it wrong.Facebook’s woes, fears President Trump will start a trade war and the Federal Reserve cautions about inflation sent the equity markets to its sharpest one week drop in two years—most of that is unwarranted.Facebook is hardly central to the U.S. or global economy. It’s a handy contraption for keeping up with family and friends. I expect that Facebook users and executives will adjust to ensure personal data is reasonably protected and in the long run its advertising revenues may decline.  If Facebook, Twitter and other social media profits and stock prices are permanently curtailed, then traditional advertisers’ profits and the underlying stock values will improve.President Trump did not start a trade war—China did!His tariffs and investment restriction directly focused on China may be imperfect but overall the volume of trade affected by the tariffs is miniscule as compared to the size of the U.S. economy. Those are not likely to affect supply chains adversely.Economic growth has averaged nearly 3 percent and corporate profits have surged over the last three quarters. The S&P 500, which includes about 80 percent of the publicly traded equities in America, is trading at 25 times earnings—just about their 25 year average.Unemployment stands at 4.1 percent—well below the sustainable level of 4.6 percent, as computed by economists who worry about such things.  According to the Philips Curve, a doctrine adhered to by most practitioners of the dismal science, wages and prices should be flying out of control, and the Federal Reserve should be aggressively raising interest rates.Neither has happened.Wages are rising about 2.7 percent a year but factoring in productivity growth, that translates into long-term inflation of less than the Fed’s target of 2 percent.Unemployment is depressed because millions of prime working aged adults have opted out of the labor force. President Obama expanded access to Medicaid and food stamps and enabled lax enforcement of standards for Social Security disability pensions, permitted millions to choose a life of genteel poverty playing video games and watching daytime TV.Now, somewhat higher wages are gradually luring those folks back into the labor market. The prime working age participation rate—those adults between 25 and 54 participating in the labor market—has been gradually recovering since the fall of 2015.During the recent recovery, several factors other than unemployment have held down inflation—expanded competition from imports, increased price competition enabled by internet commerce, and commodity prices depressed by excess capacity from the overhang of the Great Recession and the revolution in U.S. oil production.Those have mostly run their course, and we are going to have moderate inflation no matter what the Fed does about interest rates, unless Fed Chairman Powell is bent on radical actions that would thrust the global economy into the great abyss again.I doubt he is much interested in that and consequently, we can look forward to a period of inflation closer to the Fed’s 2 percent target than in recent years, the Fed gradually raising interest rates and the stock market eventually settling down and accommodating both.And we have good reason to believe that robotics and artificial intelligence are about to dramatically boost productivity growth. That will also enable faster wage growth and give the Fed a big assist keeping down inflation.The Fed is targeting three, perhaps four, small interest rate increases each year until the overnight bank lending rate reaches about 3 percent. That should put the 10-year Treasury and 30-year fixed mortgage rates at 3.5 and 4.0 percent by early 2020.The economy and stock market have sustained robust performance at much higher rates.Relax—the world is not ending!"
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/26/greg-gutfeld-end-world-or-not.html","Friday afternoon I was being my normal obnoxious self around the office, pretending to be a stoned philosopher.  ""Dude, like are you aware the earth is just a rock hurtling through space at thousands of miles an hour....we're all just passengers on this ship we call a planet,""  I said, doing a terrible Jeff Spicoli impression, for a reason I can’t remember.  But as I finished, a coworker looked at me from her desk, fretful, saying ""I don't like hearing that. It gives me a panic attack."" After all, there are certain things that, if you think about them super hard, can create anxiety to the point of inducing panic.Panic is like a gravitational attraction. That's its power. When my coworker said that she wasn't feeling right, I understood what she meant: my pseudo-observation that we are moving, despite feeling as though we are standing still, creates a disorientation that undermines your being. You begin to get a little lightheaded. Try it, just sitting here now – think about the fact that you’re actually moving thousands of miles an hour without a seat belt. I don’t like it. At all.A few of us debated doing the story on the show, but decided not to, because conjecture over a mysterious ailment can lead to trouble. My gut told me it was a psychological phenomenon driven by a contagious persuasive complaint.  A game of illness tag. Mass hysteria? Maybe. You do see this in classrooms - when a student falls ill, others around him do too. If someone smells something odd in a plane cabin and reports feeling dizzy - it tends to spread up and down the rows. I can throw up, depending on the suggestion (“you should read Paul Krugman” works amazingly fast).But even though my gut sends this diagnosis to my brain, I didn't want to say that out loud, because I could be wrong. And I didn't want to dismiss illnesses that were truly impacting a person's life.  Slate's Bures wrote, ""mass psychogenic illness is likely the best explanation for these illnesses.""  But - noted in the subhead: “the symptoms so many Americans experienced were probably not caused by a secret weapon…that doesn't mean they're not real.""My rough translation: maybe it’s in their heads, but you can’t say that.Persuasion is scary. One of my coworkers showed up with a rash, and instantly I start scratching my arms. When I smell coffee, I feel the urge to hit the rest room. I mute drug commercials, because when they rattle off side effects, I think I’m getting them.  If I smell bubble gum, I’m instantly brought back to riding the dugout bench during interminable seasons of Little League. Oddly, that brings me to a fairly recent tweet by retired four-star Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who called President Trump a ""serious threat to U.S. national security,"" because of his perceived inaction regarding Russia's meddling in our lives.That to me, should be a big story.  I listen to four-star generals. They aren't lightweights. So this worries me.  But…but…I also find all of this a little weird.  Am I seeing something that's real - or is it something else? Could there be a better explanation why people like McCaffrey, Comey, and John Brennan go off the deep end with Trump? There’s no question that they think Trump is a bad guy. They hate him, because they think he's harmful. Is there a legitimate reason for this, or, is this like those noises created by secret weapons - a bogeyman likely existing only in their heads?There are people now, who would have leaped for joy over John Bolton becoming NatSec Advisor, but who are now condemning such a choice, because Trump did it. Suddenly it’s another sign that we’re heading for war. What’s going on here?For those in the media and political circles, there is a panic. And it seems entirely real. It’s in their heads, because everybody they know is in a panic. And everybody they cover — the Democrats — is also in a panic. So everybody agrees! And it makes sense!  Here you have a group of people (the media) who absolutely believe something terribly wrong is happening. Worse, they are reassured that it's the end of the world by people who feel exactly the same way (Democrats). Or, you could look at it in reverse:  here you have a group of people (Democrats) who absolutely believe something terribly wrong is happening, reinforced by people who feel exactly the same way (the media). Nobody stops to ask John Kelly why he isn't in a panic. Or why Mad Dog isn't in a panic. Trump's presidency is a self-perpetuating panic attack: the more you hear people expressing panic about Trump, the more panic about Trump there is.   Chaos is now the new collusion. CNN screams “panic!”  Brian Stelter starts breathing into a paper sack. And click-hungry blogs like Mediaite fall in line reporting junk to the power of panic. CNN anchors then read Mediaite to each other, and feel compelled to add a new layer. They're in a panic because of the panic they've been reporting! My own panic response is always to run—against panic.  I worked in health journalism for a while, so my “Spidey-sense” for illogical overreaction is keen. I’ve resisted panics over additives, recovered memories, apples, bacon, climate apocalypses, pseudo-epidemics. One thing I learned for sure: Paranoia is bad for your health. Seeking it out and nurturing it and spreading it is a real public health issue. A side note about other recent panics: we aren’t getting more violent. We’re getting less violent. The press needs to justify its panic so it seizes on every violent incident, more than ever. A local incident goes national, on cable.  If there’s a shot fired outside a 7-11, cable news will break in.  It used to take months before one side of the country heard about some bad but minor thing occurring on the other side. A thousand people could die in the Bahamas from a hurricane, and the news would take weeks to reach Iowa. The world has actually gotten way safer – but that doesn't really support the appetite for panic in the press. Panics all share the same characteristics. They are cheap drama, they are caused by nefarious ""enemies"" (like Trump), and they are very emotional. In a way, they even feel good. And, the strategy most often advocated in the media goes like this: ""Somebody should do something."" Panic may not be much, but it is something. But is it real? Is it justified? If you want to know whether something is a truly horrible problem, or a crazy panic, read up on the world’s worst calamities: Nazism and Communism. Trace them back to their causes. You’ll notice a lack of a panic among Nazi and Communist leaders. Those guys were just calmly doing evil.The truth is, evil people calmly committing evil deeds pray for panic. It's what they want. The Holocaust was the work of a crazy German dictator who calmly decided to exterminate Jews after he engineered a panic by blaming them for his country's social and financial collapse. Communists created a panic about “exploitation.” Their solution? The murder of millions to create a system of non-exploitive ""equality"" with everyone stuck at zero, starving to death, toiling in fields to achieve one singular, hideous outcome — bones resting together in a charred heap.How did those panics happen?  Were people too busy, panicking about other things? I don’t know. But maybe worrying about climate change in an era of Islamic terror could be like worrying about the dangers of the phonograph during the Hitler era.  The reason a lot of this panicky stuff is happening is because it's what the media and the left want. They need to be right. They need to be hysterically correct. As Kevin Williamson writes, we humans are suckers for drama. “It may end up being the case that, a generation hence, historians look back on our era the way my friend does: safe and boring. “Stormy! Tariffs! DACA! Collusion! Climate change! As the British like to say, ""Remain calm and carry on."" If you have an appetite for panic, don't fall for media hype. Just call the IRS and ask them if you owe them anything. Then panic."

Serious people have written serious articles about a possible smack-down between septuagenarians President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, assessing their respective fitness and physiques (both over six feet, both weighing in at more than 200 pounds). Honestly, could there be a dopier distraction?This all comes from a verbal tit-for-tat, started, it must be said, by “Crazy” Joe Biden, who said at a recent rally what he would like to do to Trump after hearing the president’s claim that he could grab women by the you-know-what: “If we were in high school, I’d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.” That bluster was trumped by Trump tweeting that Biden “doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don’t threaten people Joe!”There you have it: the backdrop for the (verbal) Fight of the Century, perhaps paving the way for a 2020 contest between the two.Like today, the country was divided, and the Ali-loving media hyped the contest. The bout became a global sensation, with the closed-circuit TV broadcast attracting an estimated 300 million viewers in 50 countries, a record at the time. A sell-out crowd at Madison Square Garden paid as much as $900 in today’s prices for a ring-side seat. Even so, not everyone won a ticket; Frank Sinatra famously moonlighted as a Life magazine photographer to get into the Garden. Burt Lancaster, for the first and last time, was the color commentator. Never before had a prize fight gained such an audience.But after all the bluster and the hype, Ali lost the Fight of the Century. The bout went a full, grueling, 15 rounds. Ali started strong, but then Frazier landed some devastating blows in the third round, and the momentum turned. Frazier was unanimously declared the winner, to keep his title. After the fight, Ali refused to concede defeat, calling it a “white man’s decision.”  Sort of like those Democrats who continue to challenge Trump’s win.Joe Biden has walked back his verbal threat against Trump, but appears eager to challenge him in 2020. Many think he’s the Democrats’ best chance to win back the party’s traditional blue collar voters who abandoned Hillary Clinton. He would battle a number of progressive candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders for the nomination, but recent polls show him out in front by a comfortable margin. They also show him way ahead of President Trump; a January CNN poll showed him topping the president 57 to 40. Like Ali, likeable Biden has the media in his corner, in part because of the sometimes outrageous things he says.But its early days, and Biden would have to survive the primaries to get a shot of unseating Trump. He would also have to survive the kind of pummeling that Trump gave “little” Marco Rubio, “lyin” Ted Cruz and so many others during the GOP primaries in 2016.More important, with his aggressive moves to confront China on their trade cheating and theft of intellectual property, Trump is burnishing his credentials with working-class Americans who want their government to stick up for them. He has also cut their taxes and pumped up the economy; those are stiff tailwinds. In addition, Trump has surprised many by taking up liberal positions, like endorsing legal status for those covered by DACA or banning bump stocks; those unexpected stances undercut important Democrat talking points.Frazier won the Fight of the Century by catching Ali unawares with his left hook. Biden should beware: Trump has one too. "

The park, which is home to a farmers market and a hot air balloon ride, is popular with families on weekends.""I'm OK with helping homeless, but we need to solve the problem, not move the problem from one city to another,"" one resident told FOX11.COMMUNITY FIGHTS BACK AS CALIFORNIA OVERRUN BY HOMELESSNESS, HUMAN WASTE, NEEDLES“It’s not like we’re moving them into a shelter, per se. They’re basically picking up their tents and putting them on land that's actually contaminated. There’s no running water, no electricity and no sewer system,"" another resident told FOX11.Homeless advocates also oppose the Santa Ana River plan.Irvine Mayor Donald Wagner said Friday the board has placed an item on the agenda for Tuesday's board meeting to rescind the proposal, after ""nonstop efforts by the Irvine community, City Council and staff.""""Fortunately, a majority of the Board of Supervisors appears to recognize that the Irvine location for its tent city is not fit for human habitation and unacceptably close to homes, schools and parks,"" Wagner said. ""The City Council awaits a definitive vote by the Board on Tuesday, and remains as willing as always to help coordinate a collaborative solution to the countywide crisis of homelessness in a permanent, humane way. The City of Irvine is eager to be a part of that solution.""SAN DIEGO PAYS HOMELESS PEOPLE TO PICK UP TRASH IN NEW PROGRAMDuring a court hearing last week, U.S. District Judge David O. Carter said he won't constrain the county to three locations in the proposed plan, but wants to see officials create emergency shelters, the Orange County Register reported. Carter is overseeing a lawsuit against the county from seven homeless plaintiffs over the action to clear the tent city on the Santa Ana riverbed.While the county may scrap the proposal later this week, Orange County Supervisor Shawn Nelson told FOX11 that without a homeless plan in place, the judge may not allow any city in Orange County to enforce their overnight camping or trespassing laws, which could lead to homeless people being allowed to have their choice of locations to start a new encampment."
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2018/03/26/liberal-sports-radio-host-targets-kentucky-sen-mitch-mcconnell-destruction/","Kentucky’s most popular sports radio host is apparently targeting GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and hoping to add to his defeat in his likely upcoming election.Kentucky Sports Radio host Matt Jones is an unabashed, out and proud left-winger and has set himself up as Mitch McConnell’s antagonist openly announcing that he will work to defeat McConnell if the Senator decides to run for office again in 2020, Politico reported in an extensive March 26 review.Jones is particularly piqued by the fact that McConnell won’t pick a particular college basketball team to support. The Majority Leader holds degrees from both the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville. Yet, McConnell has refused to play favorites between the two, insisting he supports both.Indeed, in a recent call to Jones’ radio show, McConnell said, “It is OK — I know it’s probably not acceptable to you, as an Obama enthusiast — but it’s OK to be for both Louisville and Kentucky.”Basketball aside, Jones thinks McConnell has been bad for Kentucky.“What has Mitch McConnell done to help Kentucky?” Jones said during his Politico interview. “Mitch McConnell has been a master—a master,” he says, “at helping wealthy business interests get wealthier. If there is a rich guy Hall of Fame, he should be in it.”A big supporter of unions, Jones is pro-abortion, pro-gay marriage, and espouses an unexceptional list of left-wing beliefs; but he is one man many Kentucky liberals think might be the ideal candidate to run against McConnell if the Senator decides to run again in 2020.Jones apparently believes his own hype. “If it’s Mitch McConnell, I can win. And no other Republican will, and I don’t think any other Democrat can. But I can,” the 39-year-old radio host boasted to Politico.Jones then admitted that he is a strict “ideologue” and not a politician. “I’m not a politician. I’m an ideologue,” he said, “and I think we’re in a time when ideologues win.”The Kentucky native fashions himself as “the common fan” and thinks he has his finger on the pulse of average Kentucky voters. But he has also successfully made the move from just sports to political commentary by starting a liberal TV show entitled, Hey Kentucky!, where he routinely attacks Republicans. After branching out from sports, Jones has moderated political debates, hosted political events, and launched the New Kentucky Project, a liberal advocacy group to urge new people to run for office.Jones’ success has excited Kentucky some liberals and even sparked a movement that urged him to run for the 6th Congressional District. However, after initially saying he would run, Jones dropped out after being told by the Democrat Party that fundraising was more important than ideas. “And that was one of the most depressing things I’d ever heard,” Jones said.But this time it might be different. Jones says he wants “that battle” of ideas with McConnell. “The idea that a dorky kid from Middlesboro, who lived with his mom, could take down the most powerful politician this state has seen since Henry Clay — how could you not do that?” he said.Jones is also buoyed by McConnell’s low approval ratings. According to Politico: “One Public Policy Polling survey in August found just 18 percent of Kentucky respondents approved of the job McConnell was doing, while 74 disapproved. A Morning Consult poll in October found 33 percent of those surveyed approved and 55 percent disapproved — making McConnell the least popular senator in the country.”If the radio talker runs, it will be as a populist, Politico says. Jones will try to run away from his doctrinaire left-wing ideals and will likely insist that he represents the common man against a Senate leader who kowtows only to the elites.“We are on the right side of history on all of these issues,” Jones said, “but it’s not gonna matter in this state if we don’t get our act together.” He went on to warn the Democrat Party saying, “In my opinion, we’ve got three to five years to make a move” or “not just the progressive movement, but the moderate movement in this state is done.”In fact, Jones seems to be positioning himself as the liberal Donald Trump, an outsider who won’t employ the typical political solutions but will go for “common sense” solutions — only from the left, whereas Trump has governed from the right.“I wish the people that I love didn’t like Donald Trump,” Jones told Politico, “but I understand why they do.”Jones says he is “not someone who will do the game that people do now, on both sides, of ‘this is a good person and that is a bad person.’” He frequently states that he would prefer to talk about issues rather than people, good and bad characteristics instead of good and bad folks. He points to Kim Davis, the county clerk in Kentucky who drew national headlines in 2015 for her refusal to approve same-sex marriage proposals, as an example. Jones says he understands the hearts of evangelical conservatives like Davis far better than those who condemn them: “I know people like Kim Davis, and you don’t.”Still, many Democrats in Kentucky think that Jones is just blowing his horn to push his radio and TV shows and isn’t a serious candidate at all.In the end, the proof will come after McConnell decides if he is going to run for re-election. Until then, Matt Jones will continue to enjoy the Democrat spotlight in the Bluegrass State.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/03/26/expert-venezuelan-vp-one-hezbollahs-great-bagmen/","WASHINGTON, DC — Venezuela’s Vice President Tareck El Aissami, an official of Syrian-Lebanese origin sanctioned by the United States for his connections to drug trafficking, is a “huge” monetary contributor to Iran’s narco-terrorist proxy Hezbollah.Citing sources on the ground in Lebanon during an event late last week hosted on Capitol Hill by the Center for a Secure Free Society (SFS), Dr. Vanessa Neumann, a leading expert on drug cartels and terrorist groups in Latin America, told Breitbart News, “Tareck El Aissami is one of Hezbollah’s great bagmen, a sort of huge funder, and the money goes through the networks, and then, as you say, that money comes back through investments. … [Ground sources] have told me that, based on their perspective, he is a big player on the funding side, rather than the operations side.”Joseph Humire, an expert in Iranian activity in Latin America who serves as executive director of SFS, explained to Breitbart News that the relationship between the Venezuelan vice president is covert, behind closed doors. Humire noted, “Tareck El Aissami is protected to some degree by Hezbollah, and through that protection, they’re not going to show up at his office because then, they would be easily detected. His financial systems do benefit Hezbollah. In general, I don’t think Tareck himself, at least I don’t know about him, has a direct connection to Hezbollah on a personal level.”The U.S. government has determined that the Shiite terrorist group is heavily involved in money laundering, human trafficking, and drug smuggling across Latin America.Analysts have found that Hezbollah works with the leftist terrorist guerrilla, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), one of the top cocaine trafficking groups in the region, and notoriously violent Mexican cartel Los Zetas, which smuggles the heroin that is killing tens of thousands of Americans annually. Colombia recently legalized the FARC through a “peace deal” that guarantees them at least ten seats in Congress as a political party.The U.S. military has long warned against the nefarious activities by Hezbollah and the region.Venezuela’s “permissive environment” under socialists President Nicolás Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chávez, has allowed Hezbollah to flourish, the U.S. Department of State (DOS) warned in its latest country reports on terrorism.Echoing DOS, Humire and Neumann told Breitbart News that Venezuela has become a sanctuary for terrorism, posing a threat to U.S. national security.Neumann said, “Venezuela is viewed as a sanctuary for Hezbollah, and it’s a terrible thing because that does not align with the interests of most Venezuelans. They don’t want that. It’s a small elite that has turned the country and its mineral wealth and its financial system and its distribution system into a haven for Hezbollah.”Referring to the current state of the troubled country, Humire stated, “It’s become a [Hezbollah] safe haven. It’s become a sanctuary. It’s become a support network. Hezbollah has relied on Venezuela for very much to increase their presence throughout the Western Hemisphere.” He added, “It’s the Syria of the Western Hemisphere. Same reason Hezbollah is fighting to protect [Iran’s ally Bashar al] Assad [in Syria]: They don’t want to lose the logistical advantage — what they call the land bridge to Iran. They don’t want to lose their power in Venezuela.”Last year, CNN obtained a confidential intelligence document revealing that El Aissami issued 173 Venezuelan passports to several people who were not Venezuelan citizens, most Syrians, Lebanese, Jordanians, Iranians, and Iraqis, including individuals affiliated with Hezbollah.Hezbollah helps “provide support for keeping” El Aissami “in power,” hoping he “would be the next president of Venezuela,” Neumann declared, adding that the Venezuelan vice president “is a devout sympathizer of the [Hezbollah] cause.”Venezuela is an oil- and mineral-rich country with access to the Atlantic Ocean.Under the ruling socialist regime’s mismanagement, corruption, and bad investments, the country has squandered its wealth, leading to food and medicine crises that have prompted an exodus.Although Venezuela still has the largest-known oil reserves in the world, decaying infrastructure and inept management have plagued the once oil-rich nation with troubling poverty.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

According to the Reuters poll, only 41 percent of consumers trust Facebook to obey U.S. privacy laws. In comparison, 47 percent of consumers say they would trust Yahoo! to obey the same laws despite the site suffering their own massive data breaches in 2016, while 60 percent trust Microsoft, 62 percent trust Google, and Amazon ranked as the most trusted with 66 percent.A majority of those polled also said that they disliked the targeted advertising on social media platforms generated based on user data. They also stated that they wanted the government to step in and regulate Silicon Valley tech companies. 63 percent stated that they wanted “less targeted advertising” on websites, while only 9 percent said that they wanted to see more. 46 percent of consumers stated that they wanted to see more government regulation of companies handling private user data while only 17 percent said that they wanted to see less regulation.Facebook has suffered significant fallout from the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Key congressional lawmakers from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, a group that oversees the actions of companies such as Facebook and Google, have requested that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appear before them to testify in a formal hearing. The chairman of the committee, Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) and the committee’s head Democrat representative, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ), said in a statement:The latest revelations regarding Facebook’s use and security of user data raises many serious consumer protection concern. After committee staff received a briefing yesterday from Facebook officials, we felt that many questions were left unanswered. Mr. Zuckerberg has stated that he would be willing to testify if he is ‘the right person.’We believe, as CEO of Facebook, he is the right witness to provide answers to the American people. We look forward to working with Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg to determine a date and time in the near future for a hearing before this committee.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a CNN interview that Facebook would be reaching out to “anyone whose data might have been affected” by the Cambridge Analytica situation “And going forward, when we identify apps that are similarly doing sketchy things, we’re going to make sure that we tell people then, too.” Surprisingly, the Facebook CEO also discussed the issue of tech regulation, stating that he was not entirely against the idea. “I’m not sure we shouldn’t be regulated,” Zuckerberg said. “There are things like ad transparency regulation that I would love to see.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

After all, bump stocks do not convert semiautomatic firearms into automatic ones, so banning them as if they do opens the door to banning numerous other devices that do not convert the actions of semiautomatic either.Former ATF gun tech chief Rick Vasquez sounded this alarm in January when he warned that a bump stock will lead to other bans.He told the Military Arms Channel, “So ATF’s been directed to write a regulation with the strength of a law.” He said the advance notice copy of the new rule makes clear that the ATF’s new regulation will ban “any device that automatically resets a firearm and enhances the rate of fire.” He added, “They are trying to target binary triggers, [bump stock] devices, and other devices, but that is such broad language, can I take that to a Gatling gun? …So now you start stretching this [new] definition, and who is going to decide what the [standard] rate of fire is?” In other words, Vasquez is saying a this new ban simply opens the door to “stretching” the language to cover other devices, as the ruling class sees fit.Gun Owners of America has been warning against a bump stock gun control, be that legislative or regulative control, from the start. The NRA took the position of opposing legislation action but asking the ATF to consider a regulative move.The regulative move is in its final stages and at least one gun control activists involved in the student march is making clear the intention to use a bump stock ban as a segue into numerous other gun controls.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

I won in the coasts, I won in Illinois, in Minnesota, places like that,” Clinton said.“But what the map doesn’t show you is that I won the places that represent two-thirds of America’s gross domestic product. So I won the places that are optimistic, diverse, dynamic, moving forward, and his whole campaign, Make America Great Again, was looking backwards,” she added.McCaskill said she was particularly irked by Clinton’s comments because the former presidential candidate criticized her constituents.“I understand the point she was trying to make, but it felt like she was criticizing Missouri voters,” McCaskill told MSNBC. “I would draw a line there. I have great respect for Missouri voters, and there were a lot of reasons why they voted for Donald Trump, some of them I understand.”Since Clinton made her remarks, the Missouri Democrat is attempting to distance herself from the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee’s remarks to try and recover from trailing poll numbers in her upcoming re-election bid.McCaskill told the Washington Post that Clinton’s remarks were “fighting words,” because she is “partial” to the voters in her state “expressing their frustration with the status quo.”A Survey Monkey poll released in March showed that McCaskill’s Republican challenger, Josh Hawley, is leading in the polls with 52 percent of likely voters favoring him over the 44 percent of likely voters favoring McCaskill.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen claims he paid Daniels $130,000 to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) so she would not claim she had an affair…And this 60 Minutes interview was supposed to be the long-awaited climax of a months-long narrative, but not a single new piece of news was revealed.Even the claim from Daniels she was threatened is old (and disputed). It is also a little hard to believe. Daniels claims that she agreed to tell her story to In Touch magazine in 2011 for $15,000. According to In Touch, the story did not run because Trump’s attorney threatened to sue. Daniels says that around this time some guy walked up to her and said, “Leave Trump alone. Forget the story.” Referring to Daniels’ infant daughter, the man added, “That’s a beautiful little girl. It’d be a shame if something happened to her mom.”Daniels never went to the police.Six years later, though, she took the money from Cohen, signed the NDA, claimed in writing more than once that there was no affair with Trump, and is now breaking the NDA with the claim she had consensual sex once with Trump in 2006, who would have been married to his current wife Melania at the time.Daniels is also fearlessly cashing in big time with events like her Make America Horny tour, a media frenzy,  and what will almost certainly be a lucrative book offer.So basically, after all of the anti-Trump establishment media’s Barnum Bailey Bravado, here we are on Monday morning, right back to square one after Sunday’s night’s massive misfire.In other words, we are right back to Trump Might Have Had Consensual Sex With a Porn Star 12 Freakin’ Years Ago If Anyone Cares.And nobody cares.It is simply a fact America lost its virginity in this regard 26 years ago when this very same 60 Minutes ran to Bill Clinton’s rescue after it was revealed that the then-presidential candidate had a 12-year sexual affair with Gennifer Flowers (Clinton later admitted to the affair).Clinton lied about the affair on 60 Minutes while Hillary stood by her cheating man to spout her now-infamous “I’m not Tammy Wynette standing by her man” line. But even after Flowers released telephone recordings between her and Bill, the media still dismissed Flowers as a slut and admonished voters with the reminder that we were not electing a pope, that this is a personal matter between Bill and Hill, and that character no longer matters when it comes to finally getting rid of the evil Reagan-Bush era who is president.The only news made Sunday night is that 60 Minutes has done a u-turn and suddenly cares that Donald Trump — who has been a public figure for four decades and won the presidency even with a reputation as something of a libertine — might have boinked a porn star more than a decade ago.Basically, this Kabuki Theater of Media Hypocrisy is really only aimed at an audience of one — and that is special counsel Robert Mueller. Now that the media’s wild-eyed conspiracy theory about Trump colluding with the Russians has collapsed into a massive Obama/FBI scandal, the media are desperate to have Mueller take on Trump’s personal sex life.The stupidity of all of this media desperation can be found in the ratings — the TV ratings and Trump’s job approval ratings.While we do not yet know what Sunday’s 60 Minutes ratings look like, on Thursday night, CNN interviewed Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal about her alleged affair with Trump (also more than a decade ago), and the far-left channel still came in last place in the ratings.Meanwhile, despite the media’s twin porn and playmate obsessions, Trump’s approval rating in the latest Fox News poll jumped to a healthy 45 percent, and his overall approval numbers have steadily climbed in the Real Clear Politics poll of polls.When it was convenient to defeat a sitting Republican president in 1992, the media told voters not to care about sex. The media also told us not to care when Clinton had sex with a young intern in the Oval Office just a few rooms away from his wife and daughter.But now that caring about these things could damage a sitting Republican president, the media demand that we care.The problem for the media is this: Americans are not stupid, and the only part of this dumb spectacle we are pointing and laughing at is the spectacle of a disgraced media trying to put toothpaste back into a tube. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

It was no warmer – indeed, is slightly cooler – than either the Roman Warm Period or the Medieval Warming Period.What we also learn from the papers is that these warming periods were global – not, as alarmists like to claim to support their scaremongering thesis, local:A number of strident global warming scientists prefer to dismiss the significance of Europe’s temperature record, claiming that it is local in nature and does not tell us what is really happening globally. However, other papers fully contradict this. For example, a paper by Wündsch et al., 2018 shows us that the warming today in South Africa also is nothing unusual.Temperature reconstructions show the same is true in Southeast Australia, according to  McGowan et al., 2018, Northern Alaska (Hanna et al., 2018), the Tibetan Plateau (Li et al., 2018), South Korea (Song et al., 2018), Antarctica (Mikis, 2018), to cite just a few among dozens of others.In further bad news for climate alarmists, it seems that two of their favorite bellwethers of global warming doom – Greenland and the South Pole, are cooling not warming.Here’s Greenland, from a study by Mikkelsen et al.This puts Greenland’s recent warm spell in its historical context: over 150 years it wasn’t unusual. Temperatures now are cooler than they were in the 1930s.A separate study confirms that Greenland is on a cooling trend:Furthermore, much to the surprise of global warming scientists, Greenland temperatures have again been falling since 2000. Westergaard-Nielsen et al., 2018examined the most recent and detailed trends based on MODIS (2001–2015) and concluded that if there is any general trend for Greenland it is “mostly cooling”.As is the South Pole:At the other end of the planet at the South Pole, new findings by Cerrone and Fusco, 2018 confirm the large increase in the southern hemisphere sea ice and suggest it “arises from the impact of climate modes and their long-term trends”.They write that the results indicate a progressive cooling has affected the year-to-year climate of the sub-Antarctic since the 1990s and that the SIC [sea ice concentration] shows upward annual, spring, and summer trends.Global warming?

Tehran denies involvement.Bahraini activist Nabeel Rajab, a leading figure in the protests, has been behind bars since 2015 for tweets critical of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen.Over the weekend, Bahraini opposition activists who live in exile also took to Twitter to raise awareness over hunger strikes by female relatives, accusing authorities of stripping one woman naked after a family visit.A key US ally and home to the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet, the kingdom is also home to a British military base that is under construction.US President Donald Trump has eased restrictions on arms sales to Bahrain since taking office in January last year.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

At first it was believed that the firm worked for the Trump campaign in 2016, but that now appears to be just another piece of mainstream media fake news.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims Cambridge Analytica did this without approval. However, during the 2012 presidential campaign, there are credible reports that Facebook knew the Obama re-election campaign harvested data from users without consent but did nothing because Facebook wanted Obama to win.A Reuters poll released Sunday showed similar results. Only 41 percent trust Facebook to protect their data, compared to 66 percent for Amazon, 62 percent for Google, and even 47 percent for Yahoo.Last week, Facebook’s stock price took a 14 percent hit and the hashtag #deletefacebook, that encourages users to delete their Facebook page, gained steam all across social media.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

Sheriff Scott Israel called out Peterson for not going into the building and Peterson resigned rather than face suspension.But further reports were not kind to Israel either, and the behavior of deputies on scene were called into question as well.None of this was lost on Kashuv, who bemoaned the fact that not one protester in the student march for gun control carried signs calling out Sheriff Israel.He transitioned to the topic of Sheriff Israel while explaining why a ban on “assault weapons” and/or “high capacity magazines” would not end school shootings. He said:That won’t solve the issue. What we’ve seen is that there are certain things such as having — enforcing the regulation that’s currently in law. I mean we’ve seen on so many different levels that the cowards of Broward (ph) failed, the FBI failed, Sheriff Scott Israel failed. So many different multi-layered levels failed in Parkland. And it’s absolutely reprehensible that I didn’t see one single poster yesterday at the march that said f the NRA that — no, sorry, that said f Sheriff Scott Israel.He went on to point to armed individuals as part of the solution to school shootings. In making his case, he mentioned the good guy with a gun who shot at the Maryland school attacker on March 20, ushering in the end of the incident. He praised a newly passed law — signed on March 9 by Gov. Rick Scott (R) — which will allow certain Floridians to get training to carry guns on campus for school safety.Kashuv said, “Something called the Marshal Program, which was registered and implemented in Florida and which would allow properly trained officers and veterans, and unemployment veterans, to acquire the training to protect our school because we’ve seen in Maryland that the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.”Host Margaret interrupted as Kashuv spoke, saying, “You want — you would have liked more armed guards at the school?”Kashuv replied:Absolutely. I mean we saw it in Maryland. He stopped the shooter. He did his job. And had the cowards of Broward done their job, I think that the count in Parkland would have been much lower.

It comes as a special counsel investigates Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was any collusion with the Trump campaign.Idaho is the only Republican-dominant state that Pussy Riot is visiting during their North American tour, which has consisted of stops in bigger, left-leaning cities like Portland, Oregon; Seattle; and Chicago.They were drawn to Idaho by the small but increasingly popular Treefort Music Fest, which launched in 2011 as a hyper-local indie-rock music festival but has since attracted worldwide interest. Other groups pushed a political agenda, but Pussy Riot is one of the most contentious to appear at the five-day event.They played their political music videos on a screen on a dark stage as audience members raised their fists in solidarity. Attendees danced and cheered as the group played “Police State,” which came out on the anniversary of Trump’s election, and “Make America Great Again,” a 2016 hit released a week before the presidential election that focuses on a call to action.“Pussy Riot has been on my radar for several years,” said Boise resident Adnan Muminovic, who was standing in line for nearly two hours to ensure he got a spot for the show. “I’m Bosnian, so I’m not fan of the leadership in Russia. I wanted to throw my support behind them tonight.”Hundreds of other people stood outside the building, wrapping along the block and hoping to catch a peek of the group, which declined an interview request from The Associated Press.“I think it’s really exciting that they’re here,” said Karissa Manske of Boise, who was waiting in line. “I think it’s easy to get bogged down with everything going on in the news, but having this politically charged group come to Boise means something.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/us/politics/census-citizenship-question-trump.html","WASHINGTON — The 2020 census will ask respondents whether they are United States citizens, the Commerce Department announced Monday night, agreeing to a Trump administration request with highly charged political and social implications that many officials feared would result in a substantial undercount.In a statement released Monday, the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had “determined that reinstatement of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire is necessary to provide complete and accurate census block level data,” allowing the department to accurately measure the portion of the population eligible to vote.But his decision immediately invited a legal challenge: Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, plans to sue the Trump administration over the decision, a spokeswoman for Mr. Becerra said late Monday.Critics of the change and experts in the Census Bureau itself have said that, amid a fiery immigration debate, the inclusion of a citizenship question could prompt immigrants who are in the country illegally not to respond. That would result in a severe undercount of the population — and, in turn, faulty data for government agencies and outside groups that rely on the census. The effects would also bleed into the redistricting of the House and state legislatures in the next decade.The Justice Department had requested the change in December, arguing that asking participants about their citizenship status in the decennial census would help enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which aims to prevent voting rights violations.“The Justice Department is committed to free and fair elections for all Americans, and has sought reinstatement of the citizenship question on the census to fulfill that commitment,” a Justice Department spokesman, Devin M. O’Malley, told The New York Times in February.In a memorandum explaining his decision, Mr. Ross wrote that he had considered opponents’ arguments about the potential to discourage responses.“I find that the need for accurate citizenship data and the limited burden that the reinstatement of the citizenship question would impose outweigh fears about a potentially lower response rate,” he wrote.The decennial census generally included a citizenship inquiry for more than 100 years through 1950, according to the Commerce Department. And other, smaller population surveys, such as the Current Population Survey and the American Community Survey, continue to ask respondents about it.But critics dismissed administration officials’ reassurances.“The census numbers provide the backbone for planning how our communities can grow and thrive in the coming decade,” said Mr. Becerra. “What the Trump administration is requesting is not just alarming, it is an unconstitutional attempt to discourage an accurate census count.”Others argued that an undercount in regions with high immigrant populations would lead not only to unreliable data but also to unfair redistricting, to the benefit of Republicans.“Adding this question will result in a bad census — deeply flawed population data that will skew public and private sector decisions to ensure equal representation, allocate government resources and anticipate economic growth opportunities — for the next 10 years,” Vanita Gupta, the chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and a deputy attorney general in the Obama administration, said in a statement Monday night. “The stakes are too high to allow this. We urge Congress to overturn this error in judgment.”The announcement of the citizenship question comes at a troublesome time for the Census Bureau: Its top two positions have interim occupants, and it has been forced to skip two of its three trial runs for the 2020 census because of funding shortfalls. If response rates for the census are low, critics worry that the bureau may be unable to adjust the data or deploy enough census takers to low-response communities.The bureau is required to submit a final list of the 2020 census questions to Congress by the end of March.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/us/politics/trump-judges-courts-administrative-state.html","WASHINGTON — It has been practically a given that anyone nominated for a federal judgeship by a Republican president had to pass an unspoken litmus test — usually on abortion but often on any number of divisive social issues.The Trump administration has a new litmus test: reining in what conservatives call “the administrative state.”With surprising frankness, the White House has laid out a plan to fill the courts with judges devoted to a legal doctrine that challenges the broad power federal agencies have to interpret laws and enforce regulations, often without being subject to judicial oversight. Those not on board with this agenda, the White House has said, are unlikely to be nominated by President Trump.The criteria were first used last year in his Supreme Court selection of Neil M. Gorsuch, an appeals court judge who became something of a hero on the right for chastising his fellow jurists for being too deferential to government functionaries. And antipathy to regulations has been a factor in the selection of the dozens of judicial nominations since then.“This is different than judicial selection in past years,” Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel and the chief architect of the administration’s selection process, explained in remarks last month to the Conservative Political Action Conference, noting that previous presidents had used “single-issue litmus tests” as part of their criteria.But under Mr. Trump, he described a “coherent plan” to pair the administration’s deregulation orders with judicial nominees who find the accumulation of power in the federal bureaucracy alarming. “It’s kind of its own branch of government now, and those decisions tend to trend to the left.”This approach has shaped what could be one of Mr. Trump’s most enduring legacies, with the potential to dramatically shrink the body of federal regulations and programs that touch almost every aspect of American life — like workplace safety, environmental protection and health care.If it is successful, the Trump administration could come closer than any Republican White House has to achieving a goal conservatives have longed for since the New Deal: curtailing the reach of a federal government they say has grown far too large and invasive.“It’s the next step in the national debate about the proper role of the courts,” said Leonard Leo, a prominent conservative lawyer who is advising the administration on its judicial picks. “The administrative state is 75 years old,” Mr. Leo continued. “It’s become a huge, glaring issue.”Weeding out judicial candidates based on an ideological checklist is something Democratic and Republican presidents have long done. But it is rare for a White House to be so open about what it considers disqualifying.“In the past, presidents and their White House counsels generally don’t make this kind of pronouncement about their agenda,” said Nan Aron, the president of the Alliance for Justice, a liberal judicial advocacy group. “That’s what’s unusual about it.”That the concept of “the administrative state” has become so central to politics today shows how successful the Trump administration has been in elevating to the mainstream ideas that once thrived mainly on the edges of conservative and libertarian thought.A year ago it was a term known mostly among academics to describe the vast array of federal departments and the unelected functionaries who run them. It entered the mainstream political lexicon last year after the president’s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, pledged a “deconstruction of the administrative state” under Mr. Trump.But many conservatives now believe that a strategy centered on the administrative state creates the potential to leave a more lasting impact on the law than focusing on social issues.“That’s actually an important shift,” said Josh Blackman, an associate professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston. “Gay marriage, I think that issue is more or less settled. The court’s not going to overturn Roe. They’re just not. So let’s go somewhere you can put some points on the board.”Judges who take a skeptical view of the authority vested in executive agencies are also probably more inclined to limit liberal social policies that are enforced by the government in everything from nondiscrimination to voting rights. So social conservative groups have expressed nothing but delight with Mr. Trump’s nominees.But Democrats warn that Mr. Trump’s judicial picks are putting at risk the regulatory and social safety net that Americans need and have come to expect from their government. Conservatives have long sought to achieve this, said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. But rarely, he said, have they been so bold about it.“Trump is really giving practical effect to a theoretical construct — let’s cut administrative power, let’s shut down the deep state,” Mr. Blumenthal said. These ideas, he added, have been around for a while, “but have never been weaponized in the way that Trump is doing now with his judicial nominees.”The model jurist Mr. McGahn and others have held up is Justice Gorsuch, who replaced Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court.As an appellate judge, Justice Gorsuch was admired in conservative circles for being one of the most articulate advocates of reconsidering a legal doctrine known as “Chevron deference,” named after a 1984 Supreme Court decision involving the oil company.In its decision, the court said judges must defer to reasonable interpretations of ambiguous statutes by federal agencies on the theory that agencies have more expertise than judges and are more accountable to voters.“Judges are not experts in the field and are not part of either political branch of the government,” Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in his majority opinion.In a vetting interview with some of Mr. Trump’s senior aides during the transition, Judge Gorsuch answered a question about the 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide with a terse reply — “settled law,” he said, according to one person present. But he and Mr. McGahn went on to discuss Chevron deference at length.In one of his most famous opinions as an appeals court judge, Justice Gorsuch wrote that Chevron allowed “executive bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power.”He has taken that view with him to the Supreme Court, where he has already tried to persuade his new colleagues to revisit the Chevron question. Legal experts took notice last week when he joined Justice Clarence Thomas in a dissent critical of the court for not taking a case involving a dispute between a construction company and the Army. Justice Thomas wrote, “This court has passed up another opportunity to remedy” the accumulation of power in the federal agencies.Many of the appeals court judges Mr. Trump has picked take a view of administrative law similar to that of Justice Gorsuch. And some have found their way onto Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court shortlist, like Brett M. Kavanaugh, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and Don R. Willett, who was recently confirmed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans and has come under attack from liberal groups.One of Mr. McGahn’s former White House deputies, Gregory Katsas, is now a judge for the District of Columbia Circuit, which is generally considered second only to the Supreme Court in importance.Tellingly, one person who likely would have not made the cut under the Trump administration’s guidelines is Justice Scalia, who for most of his career embraced the Chevron deference doctrine.But this thinking has been advanced by many libertarian-minded conservatives who have long doubted whether the founders envisioned the creation of many New Deal and Great Society programs and the abundance of regulations that flowed from them.“A lot of this, if you unpack it, I think it will get back to fundamental fairness,” said Mark Holden, general counsel for Koch Industries, which is led by Charles G. and David H. Koch, two of the biggest financial backers of the effort to elect office holders committed to deregulation and free-market enterprise.The Trump judicial selection process, Mr. Holden added, was ultimately focused on “the size and scope of government and scaling it back, to the extent that it’s counterproductive and contrary to due process.”Not all conservatives are united on this question. And some see the effort to use the courts to undertake what is effectively a mission to decentralize decision-making authority as the definition of judicial activism.“This is not conservative,” said Gordon Lloyd, a professor emeritus of public policy at Pepperdine University. “This is Lenin dismantling the institutions.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/us/politics/stormy-daniels-trump.html","WASHINGTON — When Representative Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania announced on Sunday that he would join more than 40 other congressional Republicans not seeking re-election in November, he left no doubt about the reason: President Trump’s conduct made it impossible to talk about anything else.Were he running, Mr. Costello said in an interview, he would be inundated with questions about Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film actress known as Stormy Daniels, who has said she had an affair with Mr. Trump and was threatened  to stay silent about it.“If I had a town hall this week, it would be question after question,” Mr. Costello said. “‘Do you believe him or do you believe her? Why don’t you believe her?’”While Republicans have been bracing for months for a punishing election in November, they are increasingly alarmed that their losses may be even worse than feared because the midterm campaign appears destined to turn more on the behavior of the man in the White House than any other in decades.As much as gun control, immigration, the sweeping tax overhaul and other issues are mobilizing voters on the left and the right, the seamy sex allegations and Mr. Trump’s erratic style could end up alienating crucial blocs of suburban voters and politically moderate women who might be drawn to some Republican policies but find the president’s purported sex antics to be reprehensible.Polls and every recent election show that Mr. Trump has galvanized liberal and moderate voters — especially women and those with college degrees — to oppose his party. Yet at the same time, personal loyalty to the president is increasingly the most crucial litmus test for Republicans.This widening chasm has created a dilemma for Republicans, especially in liberal and swing states.If they stay faithful to Mr. Trump they risk incurring the wrath of many in the political center during the general election, likely dooming their campaigns. But if they disavow the president, they risk depressing turnout from their core Republican voters and watching their pool of volunteers evaporate overnight.“It’s a political Catch-22,” J. Tucker Martin, a Virginia Republican strategist, said. “Candidates can’t win without their base. But what it takes to satisfy a pro-Trump base in 2018 will make Republican candidates in many states unacceptable to large swaths of the electorate.”And perhaps most ominous for Republicans, there does not appear to be an obvious middle ground: Mr. Martin’s candidate for governor of Virginia last November, Ed Gillespie, sought to avoid either inflaming or embracing Mr. Trump, and he was still soundly defeated.At this point, many in the party seem more consumed with their nomination contests than with steeling themselves for the general election. And they are trying to finesse awkward topics like Ms. Clifford’s claims in ways that do not turn off primary voters.In the two states where Republicans are most at risk of losing Senate seats, the party’s leading candidates have aligned themselves with Mr. Trump so far, in an attempt to pre-empt a challenge from their right in the primary. Senator Dean Heller of Nevada and Representative Martha McSally of Arizona, the establishment-preferred Senate candidate there, have praised Mr. Trump in ways that Democratic ad-makers could use against them this fall.Such short-term calculations amount to political malpractice, say Democrats.“Trump is way more than the proverbial elephant in the room — he’s the elephant in the room with political bad breath, B.O. and a foul mouth,” said Ace Smith, a veteran Democratic consultant, who argued that the last time a president’s conduct loomed so large in congressional midterms was in the post-Watergate election of 1974.And Democrats believe that Mr. Trump so overwhelms the political conversation that it makes their own liabilities pale in comparison.“I don’t see headlines with: ‘Porn star sues Nancy Pelosi,’” said Representative Cedric Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat, when asked about his party’s polarizing House leader.Just as gun control has put many Republican candidates on the defensive after Saturday’s student-led demonstrations, Mr. Trump’s behavior is increasingly backing candidates into a corner.At a debate last week, Debbie Lesko, the Republican nominee for the Arizona congressional seat vacated by Trent Franks, said that Mr. Trump “needs to address” the claims of sexual impropriety against him.“I don’t know that he can lead on that issue, but he certainly needs to deal with it and it has to be investigated,” said Ms. Lesko, a recent state senator, adding: “I don’t use his rhetoric, and I’m certainly not going to sexually harass anyone.”But in an illustration of how firm Mr. Trump’s grip is on the party base, the president’s past comments about groping women have become an issue in some races only because pro-Trump candidates are attacking Republican rivals for abandoning him over those infamous “Access Hollywood” remarks.Michigan’s attorney general, Bill Schuette, is assailing his rival for the Republican nomination for governor, Lt. Gov. Brian Calley, because Mr. Calley backed away from Mr. Trump after the “Access Hollywood” tape came out in 2016.Indeed, the party’s embrace of Mr. Trump is most striking in several Midwestern states where he triumphed in 2016, and where a large number of important Senate and governor’s races are underway.In Indiana, three candidates for Senate have each tried to position themselves as steadfast supporters of the White House, and one predicted Mr. Trump could earn a Nobel Peace Prize for his outreach to North Korea. In West Virginia and Ohio, Republican members of Congress running for Senate are boasting of having supported Mr. Trump before their states’ primaries in 2016.But even in conservative-leaning Midwestern states, there is a deepening recognition that Mr. Trump’s volatile persona is a problem. In Missouri, home to one of the nation’s most competitive Senate races, Mr. Trump swooped in this month to headline a fund-raiser for Josh Hawley, the mild-mannered state attorney general challenging Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat.Mr. Trump used the occasion to brag loudly of having bluffed his way, using made-up facts, through a phone call with Canada’s prime minister — a boast that made international news.Former Senator John C. Danforth, a senior statesman among Missouri Republicans who is a strong backer of Mr. Hawley, called the president a challenging force in the race. Voters, he said, “object to him on the basis of his style and demeanor and the way he talks and acts toward people.”Mr. Danforth said he was hopeful voters would distinguish Republicans like Mr. Hawley, a cerebral former law professor, from Mr. Trump, rather than rejecting “anybody who has the same label Trump has.”But as Mr. Costello, the representative not running for re-election in Pennsylvania, noted, Mr. Trump’s persona did not just fuel liberal activism — it also made it nearly impossible to talk about Republican policy goals.“He blocks everything out,” Mr. Costello said of the president. “What fuels the energy isn’t the issues. It’s the personality.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/us/politics/trump-silent-stormy-daniels.html","WASHINGTON — After 61 weeks in the White House, President Trump has found two people he won’t attack on Twitter: Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal.The verbose commander in chief has posted more than 2,900 times on Twitter since taking office, using the term “FAKE NEWS” to describe everything from the Russia inquiry and allegations of chaos in the White House to harassment accusations, the size of his inaugural crowds and heated arguments with world leaders.But he has been uncharacteristically silent in recent days — to the relief of his advisers — as a pornographic film star and a Playboy model described intimate details of sexual encounters with Mr. Trump. Stephanie Clifford, known in pornographic films as Stormy Daniels, said Sunday night on CBS’s “60 Minutes” that she once spanked the president with a copy of Forbes magazine bearing his face on the cover.The fact that the president has not given oxygen to the headlines, however, does not mean that he is content.Inside the White House, Mr. Trump is eager to defend himself against allegations that he insists are false, those close to him say. And he is growing increasingly frustrated with breathless, wall-to-wall news media coverage of the salacious details from the two women.On Monday, Ms. Clifford’s lawyer added new charges to the suit she filed: that the president’s lawyer defamed Ms. Clifford in denying her claims; that he and Mr. Trump pursued the deal to specifically help Mr. Trump’s election prospects; and that he then structured the agreement to shield from public view what was, effectively, an illegal $130,000 campaign gift.In discussions with allies and some aides, Mr. Trump has privately railed against Ms. Clifford, and insisted that she is not telling the truth. He has reminded advisers that he joined an effort to enforce financial penalties against Ms. Clifford, whose TV interview on Sunday night was hyped throughout the weekend on the cable news channels that Mr. Trump watches obsessively.But there has been no debate among Mr. Trump’s advisers about the best course for him: just keep quiet about a story that would only be fueled by a presidential tweet or a comment about the women shouted above the roar of Marine One.Keeping a lid on Mr. Trump is never easy, especially when he is eager to hit back at his adversaries.In the days after an “Access Hollywood” video exposed his own lewd comments about women during the final month of the campaign, Mr. Trump responded by showing up at his debate with Hillary Clinton with three women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual improprieties.As a candidate, and as president, Mr. Trump has eagerly attacked just about all of his enemies and accusers, often with colorful nicknames like “Little Rocket Man” for the North Korean leader, “Crazy Joe Biden” or “Sloppy Steve” Bannon.But for now, it appears that the president is listening to — and accepting — his advisers’ warnings on the dangers of speaking out about the women, much the way he followed the advice of his lawyers for a year not to attack Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel in the Russia inquiry.Recently, he has ditched that advice, attacking Mr. Mueller and his team directly on Twitter. That leaves only his alleged mistresses and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as people who are immune to Mr. Trump’s Twitter trash-talk.Raj Shah, a deputy White House press secretary, declined to say “what the president may or may not have seen” on television Sunday night, though he said that Mr. Trump denies the allegations that Ms. Clifford made in the CBS interview.“I’ll just say that he’s consistently denied these allegations,” Mr. Shah said. “The president doesn’t believe that any of the claims that Ms. Daniels made last night in the interview are accurate.”Mr. Trump dined at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Saturday evening with Michael D. Cohen, his lawyer and longtime aide who is at the center of the Clifford scandal, according to three people familiar with the get-together. The president scheduled the meeting himself, surprising his aides with it a short time before Mr. Cohen arrived, people familiar with the meeting said.Melania Trump, too, has been silent about the allegations. Asked to react to the interviews, Stephanie Grisham, Mrs. Trump’s spokeswoman, said: “She’s focusing on being a mother, she’s quite enjoying her spring break and she’s focused on future projects.”It is not clear whether Mr. Trump watched a similar tell-all interview on CNN on Thursday evening, when Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, alleged a 10-month romantic affair with Mr. Trump in which they repeatedly had sex.Sunday’s interview with Ms. Clifford contained few surprises but some humiliating details, such as Ms. Clifford saying she was not attracted to Mr. Trump, and her recollection of spanking him. Virility and strength are key traits that the president likes to project, and he once gloated about a New York Post headline quoting a friend of his second wife, Marla Maples, who recalled Ms. Maples saying that Mr. Trump was the “Best Sex I’ve Ever Had.”In the interview, Ms. Clifford said that she had flirted with Mr. Trump in 2006 at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe. She said Mr. Trump had compared her favorably to his daughter during the flirtation, and that she had intercourse with Mr. Trump.She also alleged that an unknown person whom she believed to be connected to Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen threatened her in a parking lot in 2011, telling her, “leave Trump alone. Forget the story.” Then looking at her infant daughter, he added, “That’s a beautiful little girl. It would be a shame if something happened to her mom.”Asked by Anderson Cooper whether she had anything to say to Mr. Trump, if he was watching Sunday night, Ms. Clifford said, “He knows I’m telling the truth.”Even that has not prompted Mr. Trump to directly address the central allegations from Ms. Clifford and Ms. McDougal — that the president cheated on his wife shortly after Mrs. Trump gave birth to their son.Mr. Trump did type out a vague “Fake News” tweet on Monday morning, although it is unclear to what he was referring.Beyond the details of the alleged encounters, Mr. Trump’s advisers have been urging the president to keep quiet about the legal wrangling concerning Ms. Clifford and Ms. McDougal.Ms. McDougal, who accepted $150,000 from the parent company of the National Enquirer to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump, is suing the company to be released from the contract. Mr. Cohen has acknowledged paying Ms. Clifford $130,000 in the days before the 2016 election to keep quiet about her allegations.Mr. Shah said at the White House on Monday that “I can say categorically that, obviously, the White House didn’t engage in any wrongdoing.”Asked about why Mr. Trump’s lawyer would pay Ms. Clifford $130,000 if her allegations were false, Mr. Shah said that “false charges are settled out of court all the time.” He referred further questions about the case to Mr. Cohen.The lawyer for Ms. Clifford has aggressively argued that his client is not bound by the nondisclosure agreement that she signed, in part because Mr. Trump himself never signed the document. Michael Avenatti, the lawyer, has repeatedly used Trumplike insinuations to suggest that Ms. Clifford has digital evidence of the intercourse.“We have a litany of more evidence in this case, and it’s going to be disclosed, and it’s going to be laid bare for the American public,” Mr. Avenatti said in an interview Monday morning on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”Last week, Mr. Avenatti tweeted a picture of a CD or DVD with the suggestive caption: “If a picture is worth a thousand words, how many words is this worth???? #60minutes #pleasedenyit #basta.”Even that has not prompted a presidential retort — yet.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/world/europe/trump-russia-expel-european-union.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump ordered the expulsion of 60 Russian officials on Monday, joining a coordinated campaign by two dozen countries to retaliate for the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain in a Cold War-style escalation that again highlighted the disparity between the president’s words and actions.The mass expulsion of Russian personnel stationed in the United States was the largest ever, eclipsing even the darkest days of the global showdown with the Soviet Union. But Mr. Trump avoided any public condemnation of Russia’s role in the attack just days after phoning President Vladimir V. Putin to congratulate him on a re-election widely considered a sham.In approving the expulsions and ordering the closure of the Russian Consulate in Seattle, Mr. Trump followed the lead of Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain, who rallied a multinational coalition to respond to the poisoning. With London pressing for action, Mr. Trump called foreign counterparts to see if they would join, too. Aides said he encouraged them to take part, but he also knew that failure to go along would have left the United States isolated.In addition to the United States, at least 22 other nations backed Britain by expelling about 57 more Russian diplomats and intelligence officers as of Monday evening, including France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Poland and Canada. Mrs. May originally expelled 23 Russians shortly after British authorities determined that Moscow was likely responsible for the nerve agent that left Sergei V. Skripal, the former Russian spy, and his daughter in a coma.The joint action intensified the conflict between Russia and the West that has accelerated since Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine in 2014 and its clandestine effort to influence the American presidential election in 2016. Based on past practice, Russia will almost certainly retaliate by kicking out western diplomats, echoing the tit-for-tat confrontations of the Cold War.The expulsions brought into focus the disconnect between aggressive actions taken against the Kremlin by the Trump administration and the president’s public eagerness to have a cooperative relationship with Mr. Putin. Mr. Trump has staunchly resisted criticizing the Russian president, even as he imposed sanctions on a series of Russian organizations and individuals for interference in the 2016 presidential election and what the administration called other “malicious cyberattacks.”Mr. Trump, who energetically comments on almost any other subject on Twitter or in encounters with reporters, stayed conspicuously silent on the showdown with Russia on Monday, leaving it to aides to explain his decision.“The only real conclusion to draw is there is something of a divide,” said Thomas Wright, the director of the Brookings Institution’s Center on the United States and Europe. “They may have convinced him to sign off, but he doesn’t want to be the face of it. He could have resolved this any day with a 10-minute appearance. That’s the part that’s puzzling to me.”Michael Anton, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said Mr. Trump deserved credit for organizing the joint response and expressed frustration at the perception that the president had not been firm enough with Russia.“No matter what we do, it’s like, ‘You guys are soft on Russia,’” he said. “What do we have to do to show that we’re tough? We just coordinated a 22-nation action and kicked out 60 Russians.”Mr. Anton said the president did not publicly excoriate Russia for its actions because he wanted to maintain a constructive relationship at the level of the countries’ leaders. “Happy talk on one phone call is better than belligerent talk on one phone call,” he said.Speaking from the White House lectern on Monday, Raj Shah, a White House spokesman, called the poisoning attack “brazen” and “reckless,” and said that it impeded Mr. Trump’s continued desire to foster a constructive relationship with the Russians.“We want to have a cooperative relationship,” Mr. Shah said. “The president wants to work with the Russians, but their actions sometimes don’t allow that to happen.”Indeed, aides were intent on describing a president who was keenly aware of Russian misbehavior. One official, who was not authorized to publicly describe the president’s private conversations, said Mr. Trump sounded aggressive about Moscow during a discussion with advisers in the Oval Office on Friday, calling Russia’s actions of late “dangerous.”The American expulsion order was designed to root out Russians actively engaging in intelligence operations against the country, White House officials said. Those expelled included 12 people identified as Russian intelligence officers who have been stationed at the United Nations in New York, and 48 operating under the Russian Embassy in Washington. The Russians and their families have seven days to leave the United States, according to officials. American officials estimate that there are more than 100 Russian intelligence officers in the United States.The Trump administration also announced that it would close the Russian Consulate in Seattle because of its proximity to Naval Base Kitsap, one of two American naval bases that house a fleet of nuclear-powered, ballistic missile-carrying submarines.Mr. Shah said the president took a proactive role in speaking with foreign leaders and encouraging others to join the efforts. White House officials who described the expulsion order said it had coordinated with about a dozen American allies. A British official said London’s diplomats, military officers and intelligence officials had spoken with their American counterparts on a daily, even hourly, basis since the attack on Mr. Skripal.The Kremlin has maintained that it had nothing to do with the poisoning. In a statement released by the Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday, officials accused British authorities of “a prejudiced, biased as well as hypocritical stance” in carrying out the expulsions, and castigated European Union and NATO member countries for following suit.“It goes without saying that this unfriendly move by this group of countries will not go unnoticed, and we will respond to it,” the statement read.Current and former diplomats said the real test of the expulsions would be if they served to deter Russia from further intervention in other countries.“The key question for me is whether all this — and whatever else is to follow — will finally persuade Putin that the cost of killing off enemies and ‘traitors’ and subverting other people’s societies in order to ‘make Russia great again’ just isn’t worth it,” said Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to the United States. “That would be a great prize for the free world, and for British diplomacy.”Poland has positioned itself to take a lead role in coordinating a response from the Eastern European nations traditionally most wary of their giant neighbor to the east. Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz called the incident in Britain an “unprecedented attack on civilians with the use of chemical weapon, unseen in Europe since World War II.”The expulsion of Russian diplomats was an unprecedented move by Warsaw, the first time it has taken diplomatic action against its neighbor because of Russian behavior outside of Poland.Germany’s move not only signaled solidarity with London, but also suggested the incoming foreign minister, Heiko Maas, may be more hawkish toward Moscow than his predecessor.“The attack in Salisbury shook us all in the European Union,” Mr. Maas said. “For the first time since the end of World War II, a chemical war agent was used in the middle of Europe.”Mr. Maas said Germany did not take the decision “flippantly.”“But the fact and indications point to Russia. The Russian government has so far not answered any of the open questions and has shown no readiness to play a constructive role in solving this attack,” he said.Mr. Trump’s decision to join a united front against Russia came amid a personnel churn in the White House as numerous aides, including his national security adviser, Army Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, have said they will leave the administration. Last month, Mr. McMaster called evidence of Russian interference in the 2016 election “incontrovertible.”His words angered the president, who remains anxious over the continued investigation into his campaign’s contact with Russian officials. Mr. Trump publicly rebuked General McMaster on Twitter for forgetting “to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems,” referring to his Democratic election opponent, Hillary Clinton.The harsher stance on Russia will also prove to be an early test of the ideological compatibility of the president’s newly revamped national security team. Last week, Mr. Trump announced that he would replace  General McMaster with John R. Bolton, long a vocal critic of Mr. Putin who has called Russian interference in the 2016 election “a true act of war.” Mike Pompeo, the nominee for secretary of state, has been quieter with his criticisms.And then there is the president himself, whose public declarations have repeatedly found themselves in conflict with the policy decisions rolled out in his White House. Brian McKeon, who served as a chief of staff of the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, said the staff disruptions were sure to play out if the Trump administration was considering taking further action against Russia.“Bolton’s worldview is that there should be more” measures, including sanctions, Mr. McKeon said. “I don’t think that’s the president’s view.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/business/economy/federal-reserve-new-york.html","When William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, announced that he planned to step down, progressives and pro-labor groups saw a rare opportunity to influence an important economic policy appointment over which President Trump has no say.Almost immediately, they drew up a list of demands. They wanted someone who would focus more on promoting employment than on fighting inflation. They wanted a candidate who reflected diversity and who understood the New York region. They wanted a tough regulator who was independent of Wall Street. And they wanted an open search process that would give the public a voice.Instead, the New York Fed’s board appears to be close to appointing John C. Williams, a Fed insider with little regulatory experience and no close connection to New York. He is also, like everyone to hold the job in the bank’s century of history, a white man.“It’s like Exhibit A of how incredibly out of touch the Fed is with what is important and what’s happening in this country,” said Dennis M. Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a Washington-based group that has pushed for stricter financial regulation.Mr. Williams, the 55-year-old president of the San Francisco Fed, is a respected economist and an influential policymaker whose research has drawn praise even from some people critical of his possible selection. He has helped push the Fed to rethink its approach to monetary policy after the financial crisis, and has argued for policies that could lead the central bank to act more aggressively in the next crisis.Janet L. Yellen, the former Fed chairwoman whom Mr. Williams succeeded as president of the San Francisco Fed, called Mr. Williams a leader on the central bank’s policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, known as the F.O.M.C.“He’s a tremendous contributor to the Federal Reserve and the F.O.M.C., and has done influential research on monetary policy,” Ms. Yellen said.But Mr. Williams’s possible appointment — which isn’t yet final and could still change — drew swift criticism from a variety of Democratic lawmakers, progressive groups and left-leaning economists. They raised concerns about his record as a banking regulator and as a policymaker, and also criticized the search process for a lack of transparency.“The New York Fed should go back and restart their search now,” said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College economist who spent 20 years at the Fed.A New York Fed spokesman declined to comment. But in a statement this month, the leaders of the bank’s search committee said they had solicited comment from a variety of groups and had interviewed a range of candidates.In recent years, progressive groups have put increasing pressure on the Fed to diversify its leadership and to become more responsive to public concerns about inequality, slow wage growth and other issues that are outside its traditional mandate of ensuring maximum employment and stable prices. The effort has scored some notable victories, including the appointment last year of Raphael W. Bostic in Atlanta as the first African-American president of a regional Fed bank.Mr. Dudley’s announcement last fall that he would step down represented the movement’s greatest opportunity yet. The president of the New York Fed, unique among the heads of the 12 regional banks, has a permanent vote on the F.O.M.C. and serves as the committee’s vice chairman. The New York bank also plays a crucial role in carrying out the Fed’s policies, and in overseeing many of the country’s largest financial institutions.Those pushing for change had reason to hope their voices would be heard. In the past, the selection of Fed presidents has been heavily influenced by the financial institutions that are formally the stockholders of the Fed’s regional banks. But the regulatory overhaul after the financial crisis removed the banks’ representatives from the selection process. One of the two leaders of the search for Mr. Dudley’s successor is Sara Horowitz, who runs the Freelancers Union, a labor organization. The other, Glenn Hutchins, is a private equity investor.In early March, several dozen protesters marched to the New York Fed’s headquarters in Lower Manhattan to demand an appointee representing workers’ interests. Standing outside the Fed’s imposing stone building on Maiden Lane, Shawn Sebastian, director of the Fed Up campaign, which seeks to make the central bank more responsive to labor concerns, said the board could “make history” by appointing someone without Wall Street ties.“The New York Fed president is the most powerful person in the country that Donald Trump does not get to pick,” Mr. Sebastian shouted to the crowd.Mr. Williams would meet such demands in certain respects. He has spent nearly his entire career inside the Federal Reserve system and, unlike Mr. Dudley, the former chief economist for Goldman Sachs, he has never worked in the finance industry.But Mr. Williams does not have extensive regulatory expertise, and the experience he does have may not help him. He was president of the San Francisco Fed while Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco and is partly under the local Fed’s supervision, engaged in aggressive sales practices that resulted in the opening of millions of accounts without customers’ knowledge.In a statement Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Williams’s record in San Francisco “raises several questions, including about his fitness to supervise Wall Street banks.” She said the Fed’s Board of Governors, which must approve appointments, shouldn’t do so for Mr. Williams unless he testifies before the Senate Banking Committee, which has no formal role in the selection process.Fed insiders said Mr. Williams played at most a limited role in the supervision of Wells Fargo, which is primarily overseen by regulators in Washington. Bank supervision would be a much bigger part of his job if he moved to New York. But Donald Kohn, who served as vice chairman of the Fed’s Board of Governors during the financial crisis, said Mr. Williams would hardly be the first president without substantial regulatory experience. Mr. Dudley’s predecessor, Timothy F. Geithner, for example, served in a variety of government roles before joining the Fed, but had never supervised banks.“He’s been sitting in all these Open Market Committee meetings where increasingly financial stability issues are being talked about,” Mr. Kohn said of Mr. Williams.But critics said selecting Mr. Williams would be a missed opportunity to bring in a new perspective. In a commentary for Bloomberg View on Monday that never mentioned Mr. Williams, Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, noted that the New York Fed has never had a woman or a person of color as its leader.“If we’re serious about creating an inclusive and sustainable economy, no one should be left on the sidelines,” Mr. Booker wrote.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/business/nato-european-union.html","LONDON — History was not supposed to turn out this way.In the aftermath of World War II, the victorious Western countries forged institutions — NATO, the European Union, and the World Trade Organization — that aimed to keep the peace through collective military might and shared prosperity. They promoted democratic ideals and international trade while investing in the notion that coalitions were the antidote to destructive nationalism.But now the model that has dominated geopolitical affairs for more than 70 years appears increasingly fragile. Its tenets are being challenged by a surge of nationalism and its institutions under assault from some of the very powers that constructed them — not least, the United States under President Trump.In place of shared approaches to societal problems — from trade disputes, to security, to climate change — national interests have captured primacy. The language of multilateral cooperation has been drowned out by angry appeals to tribal solidarity, tendencies that are heightened by economic anxieties.“What we’ve seen is a kind of backlash to liberal democracy,” said Amandine Crespy, a political scientist at Free University Brussels (ULB) in Belgium. “Masses of people feel they have not been properly represented in liberal democracy.”Even as nationalists take aim at globalists, the eventual shape of international relations remains an open question. In a sign that investors are optimistic that talks can yet avert a trade war between the United States and China, markets soared on Monday. And the United States, Canada and other European nations expelled Russian diplomats in solidarity with Britain over the poisoning of a Russian defector in London, enhancing hopes that old alliances will endure.Still, public anger at traditional centers of power remains fierce in many lands, with Mr. Trump’s election the most potent manifestation. He has claimed a mandate to attack the global establishment and its sacred institutions in the name of reasserting American primacy. He has injected uncertainty into the American commitment to NATO while dismissing the World Trade Organization as a “disaster.”Within a White House roiled by tumult, recent weeks have demonstrated that the nationalists have seized the upper hand from their few globalist peers. Gary Cohn, the Goldman Sachs alumnus who advised Mr. Trump on economic policy, has departed. Peter Navarro, the stridently anti-China trade adviser, has gained influence. Since then, Mr. Trump has antagonized core allies with tariffs on steel and aluminum while raising the specter of a trade war with China.But the United States is far from the only power tearing at the foundations of the postwar order.Britain is abandoning the European Union, turning its back on the project whose very existence is an expression of faith that integration discourages hostilities. Italy just elevated two populist political parties that nurse historical animosities against the bloc.Poland and Hungary, once viewed as triumphs of democracy flowering in post-Soviet soil, have shackled the media, cracked down on public gatherings, and attacked the independence of their court systems.This re-emergence of authoritarian impulses has undercut a central thrust of European policy since the end of the Cold War. Expanding NATO and the European Union by bringing in Eastern European nations was supposed to have prompted the newcomers to adopt the liberal democratic values of their fellow members. Things went differently.China has used its economic power — enhanced by its entry to the W.T.O. in 2001 — to reinforce the authority of a state still controlled by the Communist Party. This, too, has dashed hopes that China’s integration into the global economy would lead to its democratization.And Russia, which joined the trading organization in 2012, has since intensified a foreign policy that is centered on confrontation.For anyone still inclined to believe that liberal democracy is the inevitable outgrowth of human progress — an outcome hastened by the postwar institutions — these events have provided a sobering rejoinder.“What we are returning to is great power politics,” said Derek Shearer, a former American ambassador to Finland during the Clinton administration and the director of the McKinnon Center for Global Affairs at Occidental College in Los Angeles.The causes of this turn vary from country to country, but a common element is public distrust of institutions amid a sense that the masses have been abandoned.In the United States and Britain, working people have suffered joblessness and declining living standards while political leaders have prescribed policies that have enriched the elite — more trade deals, fewer strictures on bankers. These countries’ economies have been bolstered by trade, but not enough of the gains have filtered down to working people.Even as China has violated trade rules, subsidizing state-owned companies and stealing innovations from foreign investors, commerce across the Pacific has lifted the American economy. But American leaders have failed to deliver job training and other programs that might have cushioned the blow for communities hurt by imports.“Many people in Europe and the United States have not benefited very much from overall economic growth over the past few decades, and they are naturally skeptical of the policies and leaders in place,” said Douglas W. Elmendorf, dean of the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. “But the solution is not to throw out the liberal order. It is to complement it with government policies that allow people to share in the benefits.”Economic threats have combined with rising nativist inclinations to amplify hostility toward power centers.In Poland, Hungary, Britain and Italy, distrust of the European Union reflects public anger at its liberal immigration policies, and an influx of people from Muslim countries. In the United States, Mr. Trump has found support among those inclined to blame immigrants for joblessness, and Muslims for security threats.Mr. Trump’s trademarks — “Make America Great Again,” and “America First” — underscore his forsaking of his country’s traditional commitment to collective ideals.When he bypassed the World Trade Organization last week to slap tariffs on some $60 billion in Chinese imports, Mr. Trump reinforced his scorn for multilateralism as the province of weak-kneed sentimentalists. He appears to subscribe to the notion that the United States, the largest economy on earth, must unabashedly pursue its self-interest, free of constraints like naïve reverence for the rules of the global trading system.In Europe, Mr. Trump’s willingness to flout trade rules has combined with his denunciation of the Paris climate accord and his equivocal support for NATO to force questions about America’s reliability.“The U.S. was always seen as a stabilizing force within the post-World War II order,” said Ms. Crespy of the Free University Brussels. “From a European perspective, the shock comes from the fact that the U.S. is now seen as a destabilizing force, like Russia, and ironically making China look more moderate.”The institutions created after World War II have never lacked for critics — or instances of failing to live up to lofty rhetoric.The International Monetary Fund has long provoked criticism that it caters to the investor class while imposing austerity on ordinary people in crisis-hit countries. Trade deals have been crafted to advance the interests of politically connected special interests. Labor groups have accused the European Union of harboring an unhealthy obsession for avoiding budget deficits at the expense of jobs. Democratic convictions have not stopped the West from supporting authoritarian regimes in pursuit of their own strategic goals.But if the justice of the liberal order has been contentious, now its basic endurance appears in question.In the early 1990s, shortly after the Berlin Wall came down and the West claimed victory in the Cold War, Francis Fukuyama, a Stanford University political scientist, famously suggested that the global arrangement of power had reached its conclusion.“What we may be witnessing is not just the end of the Cold War, or the passing of a particular period of postwar history, but the end of history,” Mr. Fukuyama wrote in a book that took that provocative phrase as its title. “That is, the end point of mankind’s ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.”Thinkers across the ideological spectrum excoriated Mr. Fukuyama for penning history’s premature obituary. Some accused him of evangelizing for American power. Others would say he was blind to the threat of radical Islamist terrorism, the resurgence of Russia, and the ascendance of China.Last year, with Mr. Trump assuming office, Britain leaving Europe, and nationalists on the march, Mr. Fukuyama suggested a new obituary might be required — for the “liberal world order.”More than a year into the Trump era, Mr. Fukuyama has only grown more alarmed.“What you’re seeing now is really insidious, because it’s coming from within democracies,” he said in an interview. “It’s not just the U.S., but Hungary, Turkey, Poland and Russia, where you have a democratically elected leader who is trying to dismantle the liberal parts of liberal democracy. We are seeing a new type of threat that I don’t really think we’ve seen in my lifetime.”History is still running. New leaders may be capable of delivering policies that could restore faith in internationalism. Yet for now, the globalists who have long dominated are losing ground to a thriving nationalist insurgency.“Trump is weakening the United States at a crucial time,” said Mr. Shearer, the former ambassador to Finland. “It’s more important than ever that the U.S. be strong and united and stand up for the values we claim to stand for. This ‘America First, Go It Alone,’ is so wrongheaded. It’s bad for us, and bad for the world.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/us/politics/trump-rob-porter.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump has stayed in touch with Rob Porter, the former White House staff secretary who stepped down after allegations that he had abused his two former wives came to light, according to three people familiar with the conversations, and has told some advisers he hopes Mr. Porter returns to work in the West Wing.The president’s calls with Mr. Porter have increased in the last few weeks, as the number of people he is close to in the White House has dwindled because of the large number of staff departures, the people familiar with the calls said.In Mr. Trump’s orbit, few people are ever permanently exiled. He often sees aides who are subject to public criticism as extensions of himself, coming under fire because critics want to attack him, and he has described the Porter situation in those terms to some people, those briefed on the discussions said.The president has told the advisers he has talked with that he knows he probably cannot bring Mr. Porter back. But he has made clear that he misses the staff structure that Mr. Porter had helped build and implement, a White House official said, speaking on background because advisers were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Mr. Porter also served as a de facto deputy chief of staff for policy, playing a key role on issues like tariffs, and Mr. Trump spent as much as two hours a day with him.It was not immediately clear how many conversations Mr. Porter has had with the president since leaving, but one person familiar with the discussions said they have talked about trade and how to navigate granting exemptions to the tariffs Mr. Trump announced last week.A White House spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Porter also declined to comment.Mr. Porter left the White House on Feb. 7, after The Daily Mail published accounts from his two ex-wives claiming emotional and physical abuse during the course of his marriages to them. One story included a photo of one of the ex-wives, Colbie Holderness, with a black eye she said Mr. Porter had given her.Ms. Holderness, who split with Mr. Porter in 2008, and his second wife, Jennifer Willoughby, have both been vocal about their allegations about their ex-husband. Mr. Porter has denied the allegations, and said the photograph did not tell the full story of either marriage. Mr. Trump has told some advisers that the news media scrutiny of Mr. Porter was so excessive that it left him unable to defend himself.Mr. Trump has told people that he believes that Mr. Porter’s departure was botched, primarily but not exclusively by his chief of staff, John F. Kelly. White House officials initially said at the time that Mr. Porter had decided on his own to resign, and some said Mr. Kelly had asked Mr. Porter to stay on. But they later offered a different account — that Mr. Kelly had told Mr. Porter to resign soon after learning of the allegations, though there were multiple accounts of how Mr. Kelly had been aware of some of the allegations for months.Despite his responsibilities, Mr. Porter did not have a five-year security clearance, only an interim one, during his time at the White House. His interim clearance was never revoked after a full F.B.I. investigation, a fact some White House officials noted when he resigned as an indication that his case was more nuanced and complex than news media accounts had suggested.But his case led to a sweeping change in how the White House handles interim security clearances, with a new process that some White House officials have privately said is being used as a weapon against specific staff members, with partial information being dribbled out to the press in an inflammatory way.One of those people, some in the White House believe, was Mr. Trump’s personal assistant, John McEntee, who was hustled out of the White House so quickly two weeks ago that he did not have time to collect his jacket. Mr. McEntee had a gambling habit that could have led to financial issues, White House officials have said, but early news accounts painted him as under criminal investigation, reports that were later contradicted.Mr. Trump has told advisers that Mr. McEntee is a “good kid” who was dealt with unfairly and that he would like to bring him back.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/business/media/stormy-daniels-60-minutes-ratings.html","Stormy Daniels is a ratings blockbuster.CBS’s “60 Minutes” interview on Sunday night featuring the pornographic film actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, garnered the highest ratings for the program in almost a decade. It drew 22 million viewers, according to Nielsen, more than the much-hyped recent telecasts for the Grammys and the Golden Globes.The segment on Ms. Clifford, who said she had a sexual relationship with Donald J. Trump in 2006 and had been offered money to keep it quiet, took up more than half the episode. The start of the episode was delayed 36 minutes by an overtime NCAA men’s basketball tournament game between Kansas and Duke. The CNN anchor Anderson Cooper, who joined “60 Minutes” as a correspondent in 2006, conducted the interview.The episode was the best performer for “60 Minutes” since the airing of Steve Kroft’s interview with Barack and Michelle Obama after the 2008 election, which had more than 25 million viewers. The ratings on Sunday were probably helped somewhat by a strong lead-in, the college basketball game, which Kansas won, 85-81.The rise of streaming has fractured the television audience, and it has become a rarity for a show to draw more than 20 million viewers. The exceptions are live broadcasts of major sporting events and awards shows.The interview segment with Ms. Clifford made for a bigger draw than the telecasts of this year’s Grammys (19.8 million) and the Golden Globes (19 million). The “60 Minutes” episode also had more viewers than the usual editions of NBC’s “Sunday Night Football,” which averaged 18 million viewers, and came within striking distance of ABC’s telecast last month of the Academy Awards, which had 26.5 million viewers.The highly anticipated segment on Ms. Clifford kicked off viewing parties, both at home and at bars.The broadcast also outperformed recent “60 Minutes” breakout episodes. The El Chapo-focused interview with Sean Penn, in January 2016, drew 20.6 million viewers, and Lesley Stahl’s sit-down with Mr. Trump and his family, soon after he won the presidential election in November 2016, drew 20 million.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/world/europe/trump-russia-diplomats-expulsion.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump ordered the expulsion of 60 Russians from the United States on Monday, adding to a growing cascade of similar actions taken by western allies in response to Russia’s alleged poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain.Poland, Italy, Denmark, France and Germany were among 14 European Union member nations announcing plans to expel Russians from their countries in solidarity with Britain, which previously expelled 23 Russian diplomats after the poisoning. Canada also said it would expel four.The American expulsion order, announced by administration officials, includes 12 people identified as Russian intelligence officers who have been stationed at the United Nations in New York, and also closes the Russian consulate in Seattle. The Russians and their families have seven days to leave the United States, according to officials.The expulsions are the toughest action taken against the Kremlin by President Trump, who has been criticized for not being firm enough with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The officials said the action was a coordinated effort with other allies. Poland announced it will expel the Russian ambassador and several other diplomats in response to the poisoning. And Germany announced plans to expel four Russian diplomats within the next week.In a call with reporters, senior White House officials said that the move was to root out Russians actively engaging in intelligence operations against the country, and to show that the United States would stand with NATO allies. The officials said that the closure of the consulate in Seattle was ordered because of its proximity to a U.S. naval base.“Today’s actions make the United States safer by reducing Russia’s ability to spy on Americans and to conduct covert operations that threaten America’s national security,” the White House said in a statement.The Kremlin has maintained that it had nothing to do with the poisoning.Britain’s decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats over the poisoning initially raised tensions between the two countries to a level not seen since the heights of the Cold War. The government vowed to crack down on Russian spies, corrupt elites and ill-gotten wealth in Britain.On March 15, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on a series of Russian organizations and individuals for interference in the 2016 presidential election and other “malicious cyberattacks,” its most significant action against Moscow until Monday.Those sanctions came as the United States joined Britain, France and Germany in denouncing Russia for its apparent role in a nerve-gas attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter on British soil, calling it a “clear violation” of international law.White House officials called the nerve agent used against the Skripals “military grade,” but declined to elaborate on the substance used.American officials estimate there are currently more than 100 Russian intelligence officers in the United States.Mr. Trump has said that, despite its denials, Russia was likely behind it. “It looks like it,” he told reporters in the Oval Office on March 15, adding that he had spoken with Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain.“We are in deep discussions,” Mr. Trump continued. “A very sad situation. It certainly looks like the Russians were behind it. Something that should never, ever happen. And we’re taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.”Mr. Trump has been slower to act than leaders in Britain, France and Germany over the attack, in which Sergei V. Skripal, 66, a former spy, and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, 33, were attacked with a nerve agent.The senior administration officials who described the expulsion order said the three weeks that lapsed between the attack and White House action was due to close coordination among about a dozen American allies.Poland has positioned itself to take a lead role in coordinating a response from the Eastern European nations traditionally most wary of their giant neighbor to the east.The Russian ambassador to Poland, Sergei Andreyev, was summoned to the foreign ministry on Monday morning and informed of imminent diplomatic action against his country. The Polish foreign minister was expected to make an announcement later this afternoon.The Polish foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz called the tragic incident in Britain an “unprecedented attack on civilians with the use of chemical weapon,” that had not been seen since World War II.Mr. Czaputowicz said the Russian ambassador and three other diplomats were now considered “persona non grata,” giving them until April 3 to leave the country.Russia’s overall goal, Mr. Czaputowicz said, is to “disrupt international order and create a sense of danger.”Any expulsion of Russian diplomats would be an unprecedented move on Warsaw’s part, the first time they took diplomatic action against their neighbor due to Russian behavior outside of Poland.Since Poland broke from the Soviet bloc in the 1990s, it has expelled Russian diplomats only twice — and both times had to do with Russia’s spying activities in Poland.Germany’s move not only signaled solidarity with London, but it also suggested the incoming German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, may be more hawkish toward Moscow than his predecessor.“The attack in Salisbury shook us all in the European Union,” Mr. Maas, said. “For the first time since the end of World War II a chemical war agent was used in the middle of Europe.”Mr. Maas said Germany did not take the decision “flippantly.”“But the fact and indications point to Russia. The Russian government has so far not answered any of the open questions and has shown no readiness to play a constructive role in solving this attack,” he said.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/fashion/weddings/a-merger-for-the-rabbi-and-the-labor-leader.html","Randi Weingarten and Rabbi Sharon Anne Kleinbaum are to be married March 25 at La Marina, a restaurant in New York. Judge Michelle Schreiber of the New York City Housing Court, is to officiate, with Rabbi Sharon Cohen Anisfeld, the president of Hebrew College, leading the religious ceremony, which will include the signing of the ketubah.Ms. Weingarten (left), 60, is the president of the American Federation of Teachers, which has headquarters in Washington. She graduated from Cornell and received a law degree from Cardozo School of Law, Yeshiva University.She is the daughter of Gabriel Weingarten of Suffern, N.Y., and the late Edith Appelbaum Weingarten.Rabbi Kleinbaum, 58, is the senior rabbi of Congregation Beth Simhat Torah in New York, a synagogue with a significant number of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender congregants. She graduated from Barnard College and from Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Wyncote, Pa.She is the daughter of Josephine Leve Kleinbaum of Teaneck, N.J., and the late Max M. Kleinbaum.In the mid-1990s, Rabbi Kleinbaum and Ms. Weingarten knew each other peripherally.“We were two lesbians in New York fighting for different things,” Ms. Weingarten said. “We liked each other. We had good banter. It wasn’t as if there were a lot of high-profile gay women who were active in leadership roles. I thought she was fun, witty and smart.”It continued that way until 2006. Both were at the Empire State Pride Agenda dinner, when Rabbi Kleinbaum asked Ms. Weingarten to speak at the Gay Pride Shabbat service.“I’d just turned 50, I’d never publicly come out and said, ‘I’m a lesbian,’” Ms. Weingarten said. “Sharon allowed me to see myself as who I was. It shifted my thinking that it wasn’t simply about having a gay pride speaker. It was about shifting me. I was very moved by it.”Rabbi Kleinbaum recalls the “ask” a little differently.“She’s one of the most significant labor leaders in America,” Rabbi Kleinbaum said. “I didn’t get how dramatic it would be for her. I just thought it would be an amazing coup if she said yes.”Years went by. They continued to see into each other sporadically until 2012. While Ms. Weingarten was working in Washington and dating, Rabbi Kleinbaum was in New York getting divorced after an 18-year relationship.“I’d heard Sharon was single, so I emailed her asking if she wanted to have lunch,” Ms. Weingarten said.Rabbi Kleinbaum wrote back the following day. But it was not an easy time in her life.“My whole world was falling apart,” she said. “It was such a difficult time for me. I was carrying the load of a full-time position. I had two daughters. I wasn’t thinking about anyone in that way.”Eight or nine email exchanges later, lunch got parlayed into dinner and a friendly request grew into an actual date.“Flirt entered into the emails,” Ms. Weingarten said. “I was really excited about it. But I almost screwed the whole thing up. I got invited to the state dinner by President Obama for David Cameron.”It was a plus-one invitation. “I asked Sharon if she would be willing to have our date at the White House rather than in New York,” Ms. Weingarten said.Rabbi Kleinbaum immediately declined.“I would never go to the state dinner as a first date,” Rabbi Kleinbaum said. “I’m interested in intimacy. Everyone would think we were on a date. I started wondering if I was ready for that. I wasn’t even sure I wanted to be in a relationship again. I wanted to take things slow.”So they did. Ms. Weingarten attended the dinner with a colleague. The next day she and Rabbi Kleinbaum went for Indian food in the West Village. They talked all night.“There was no political-speak,” Ms. Weingarten said. “We talked about our lives and things that were important to us. It was a fantastic first date. I didn’t want the night to end.”That same year, Rabbi Kleinbaum moved into an apartment in the Inwood section of Manhattan. Ms. Weingarten commuted back and forth from Washington, spending two nights there, two nights in New York and other days traveling for work.“My life had been turned upside down,” Rabbi Kleinbaum said. “Here I was in my 50s with my dogs, and all I had was a mattress on the floor. But Randi never seemed uncomfortable. I thought, this is an incredibly kind person. I value kindness. Slowly I got furniture.”As her apartment grew, so did their relationship.In 2014, they began looking for an apartment together. Three years later they found one. Their proposal and engagement almost took as long. When Obergefell v. Hodges was decided in 2015, an excited Ms. Weingarten asked if the decision meant they could get married. Rabbi Kleinbaum wanted to wait.“We’re not spring chickens,” Rabbi Kleinbaum said. “We didn’t believe we would get this kind of love this late in our lives.”In June 2017, they both agreed it was time.“We have a deepening relationship,” Rabbi Kleinbaum said. “We’re both astounded we found each other and both astounded we’re making it work. If you live long enough, life is full of surprises.”

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/597021235/tumblrs-ban-of-russian-accounts-adds-detail-to-targeting-of-black-americans","Tumblr has listed a number of accounts linked to Russian social media agitation   giving the newest look at a sophisticated effort to sow discord between Americans — including black users.The blogging service announced that it had discovered more than 80 accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, the professional troll farm indicted by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller. IRA workers created hundreds of social media accounts across many platforms in an effort to turn up the volume of political disputes taking place between Americans online. That included using fake online accounts to organize real-world political events and posing as black Americans to address real black Americans discussing race, law enforcement and the 2016 political campaign.On Tumblr, the Russians used accounts called ""black-to-the-bones;"" ""blackness-by-your-side;"" ""blacknproud;"" ""blacktolive;"" and ""bleepthepolice."" Others were called ""noteverythingiswhite;"" ""starling-all-black-all-day;"" and ""weproud2black."" Still other accounts changed their names to drop or pick up apparent black affinity — one went from ""blackprideworldwide"" to ""shoutoutworldwide;"" another went from ""heygeraldmartinjohanssen"" to ""ghettablasta"" to ""postingwhileblack.""""Their goal is to sow division and discontent in the countries they target,"" said a post on Tumblr's own official blog. ""What makes them so difficult to spot is that they're not spambots. They're real people who get trained and paid to spread propaganda.""Tumblr sent an email to users identifying accounts with which they may have interacted, but it wasn't clear Monday how much effect the Russian users had over the social media platform. Last year, Tumblr was credited with around 345 million accounts and many more individual users, but there was no immediate information about what kind of total reach the Russian accounts may have had.The largest part of the social media agitation aspect of Russia's active measures campaign probably involved Facebook. It illustrated how a comparatively small effort can achieve larger effects across a network. Russian influence-mongers bought a relatively small number of paid ads on Facebook and Instagram, which Facebook owns, but once they had been shared and users began seeing more free content, around 150 million people saw some Russian material, the social media giant said. Black users and Black Lives Matter were a target on Facebook as well, according to Mueller's indictment. The best-known account, ""Blacktivist,"" and others sought to divide black users from within. In another example from Mueller's indictment, IRA influence-mongers used the Instagram account ""Woke Blacks"" to encourage followers not to vote for any candidate in 2016.""[A] particular hype and hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we'd surely be better off without voting AT ALL,"" a post from the account said. This aspect of Russia's active measures continued a decades-long practice of targeting race inside the United States. More recently, there have been indications that influence-mongers piggybacked on real users' protests about news coverage of the Austin bombings — which critics said got short shrift because some of its victims were black — as well as last year's NFL protests, the violence in Charlottesville Va. and other stories. Tumblr said that it didn't think Russian influence-mongers bought any paid ads on its platform. The service said it discovered only human-posted and shared material and urged users to take care.""They want to drive a wedge between us so that we spend our time fighting with each other instead of building towards the future,"" Tumblr's post said. ""We'll be watching for signs of future activity, but the best defense is knowing how they operate and how to judge the content you see."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/597077701/despite-cash-from-congress-key-election-security-issue-may-not-get-fixed","The massive spending bill President Trump signed into law on Friday includes enough money to replace voting machines that leave no paper trail, a top priority for many election officials and cybersecurity experts. But according to a new analysis, it seems unlikely that's how the money will be spent. The analysis, published by New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, says it would cost somewhere between $200-$400 million to replace every electronic voting machine in the U.S. that doesn't create a paper ballot or receipt. More than a dozen states still use these types of machines, despite concerns that they are vulnerable to hacking or manipulation without a trace.""They can be attacked remotely by sophisticated attackers to make them lie about the election outcome,"" J. Alex Halderman, a professor of computer science at the University of Michigan, and a leading voice arguing for tightening election security, told NPR earlier this year.Congress allocated $380 million toward improving election infrastructure, as part of the omnibus spending bill that was signed last week, leading many in the voting and elections community to rejoice. But that money is going to be allocated based on the same population-based formula laid out in the 2002 Help America Vote Act, as the $380 million represents money that was approved as part of that legislation but was never spent. The U.S. Election Assistance Commission will determine the exact amount each state receives, but the Brennan Center put together a rough estimate.According to the Brennan Center's estimates, only two of the 13 states that use machines that lack an auditable paper trail — Arkansas and Delaware — could receive enough money to fully replace them. Most of the states are expected to receive less than 60 percent of what it would cost to fully replace the paperless systems currently in use.Tammy Patrick, the senior elections adviser at the Democracy Fund, said the money allocated in the omnibus spending bill showed that ""the need for resources is finally being taken seriously,"" but she did not want Congress to assume this allocation was enough to take care of election security needs leading up to the 2020 presidential election.""The thing that is unfortunate it that it's always some catastrophic event before people start paying attention — it took Florida in 2000, it took a foreign adversary in 2016 before this got taken seriously,"" Patrick said. ""[The omnibus spending bill money] will absolutely not fund or remedy us to where we need to be. But it's a big step forward."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/26/597145996/stormy-daniels-sues-trump-attorney-for-defamation","Fresh off her Sunday interview with CBS's 60 Minutes to discuss her alleged sexual encounter with President Trump, adult film actress Stormy Daniels is suing the president's personal lawyer Michael Cohen for defamation. The suit from Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, against both Trump and Cohen was amended Monday in the U.S. District Court in California, asking for a jury trial to settle the claim of defamation against Cohen. Daniels says that Cohen defamed her when he put out a statement in February regarding the $130,000 payment he made to her just before the election, allegedly in exchange for her silence. In that statement to the media, Cohen said, ""Just because something isn't true doesn't mean that it can't cause you harm or damage."" Daniels' lawsuit argues: It goes on to claim that Cohen's statement caused Daniels ""hatred, contempt, ridicule, and shame, and discouraged others from associating or dealing with her"" and that she ""has suffered damages in an amount to be proven at trial according to proof, including but not limited to, harm to her reputation, emotional harm, exposure to contempt, ridicule, and shame, and physical threats of violence to her person and life."" Daniels had already been suing to dissolve the nondisclosure agreement she had signed in October 2016, claiming it was invalid because Trump, labeled as ""David Dennison"" or ""DD"" in the document, had not signed it. Cohen made the payment to Daniels through a limited liability corporation he formed, Essential Consultants LLC, and has said he did so with his own personal funds. The amended filing also alleges that the payment from Cohen violated federal election law because it was an in-kind campaign contribution to Trump that was never reported and that exceeded federal contribution limits — an issue that has also been raised by the organization Common Cause. Cohen has denied any such wrongdoing. In the 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper, Daniels detailed how she met Trump and had consensual sex with him in July 2006 — shortly after his wife, Melania, had given birth to their son Barron — at a golf resort in Lake Tahoe, Calif. Daniels said she did not want to have sex with Trump after going to his hotel room alone with him, but she said she ""was not a victim."" ""I realized exactly what I'd gotten myself into,"" she said in the interview. ""And I was like, 'Ugh, here we go.' And I just felt like maybe — it was sort of — I had it coming for making a bad decision for going to someone's room alone and I just heard the voice in my head, 'Well, you put yourself in a bad situation and bad things happen, so you deserve this.' "" Earlier this month, Cohen asked a federal court to enforce the nondisclosure agreement, claiming Daniels violated the agreement and is liable for $20 million in damages. The president joined the case, and the filing said that ""Mr. Trump intends to pursue his rights to the fullest extent permitted by law."" Cohen wants that disagreement settled by private arbitration. Trump himself has not directly reacted to Daniels' interview, though he did slam the media for ""So much Fake News"" in a tweet Monday morning. Monday afternoon, White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah said that Trump had ""consistently"" denied the claims made by Daniels and argued that her story has been inconsistent. In her interview with Cooper, Daniels acknowledged she had signed a statement earlier this year denying the encounter ever happened, but she said that was only because she was pressured to do so by her former lawyer and business manager, who told her that ""they can make your life hell in many different ways."""

They and their families are being given seven days to leave the U.S. Of the 60 officers being expelled, 48 are members of the Russian Embassy and 12 are officers from Russia's mission to the United Nations in New York.The consulate in Seattle is being shuttered because of its proximity to a U.S. submarine base and Boeing's operations there, a senior administration official said. The consulate must close by April 2.""The United States takes this action in conjunction with our NATO allies, and partners around the world in response with Russia's use of a military grade chemical weapon on the soil of the United Kingdom — the latest in its ongoing pattern of destabilizing activities around the world,"" the official said.""Today's actions make the United States safer by reducing Russia's ability to spy on Americans, and to conduct covert operations that threaten America's national security,"" the official continued. ""With these steps, the United States and our allies and partners make clear to Russia that its actions have consequences.""Russia's ambassador to the United States, Anatoly Antonov, called the U.S. decision to expel Russian diplomats ""wrongful"" and said it was harming already weak U.S.-Russian ties, Reuters reported, citing the RIA news agency.RIA also quoted a member of the upper house of the Russian parliament as saying that Russia would expel at least 60 staff from U.S. diplomatic missions in the country, Reuters reports.The expulsions come amid internal conflict at the White House and State Department on how to handle Russia. Last week, Trump congratulated Vladimir Putin on his re-election as president and did not bring up Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign nor Russia's hacking of the U.S. power grid. But Trump is also bringing in John Bolton, a Russia hawk, as his national security adviser. The U.S. has also instituted more sanctions against Russia.At least 21 countries made the same move on Monday, the Associated Press reported. Germany, France, Canada, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Estonia, Italy, Poland, Lithuania, Hungary, Macedonia, and Australia among others, all announced that they would be asking Russian diplomats to leave.The German foreign ministry said in a statement that ""the expulsion of four diplomats is a strong signal of solidarity with Great Britain and signals the resolve of the Germany government not to leave attacks against our closest partners and allies unanswered,"" The AP reports.Britain insists it has proof that Russia was behind the nerve-gas poisoning of the Skripals, who remain in critical condition. A police officer who assisted them has been released from the hospital. Traces of the Soviet-era nerve agent called novichok were found in a pub and an Italian restaurant that the Skripals visited, possibly exposing hundreds of people.British Prime Minister Theresa May said in a statement, ""We welcome today's actions by our allies, which clearly demonstrate that we all stand shoulder to shoulder in sending the strongest signal to Russia that it cannot continue to flout international law.""May said it was the largest mass expulsion of Russian diplomats in history.NPR's Joanna Kakissis contributed to this report."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/26/597135373/ftc-confirms-its-investigating-facebook-for-possible-privacy-violations","Updated at 7:50 p.m. ETThe Federal Trade Commission confirmed Monday that it is investigating the possible misuse of the personal information of as many as 50 million Facebook users. The probe comes after the social network admitted it suspended a firm that worked on behalf of the Trump campaign to use personal information gathered on Facebook to target potential Trump supporters.Privacy activists and some members of Congress have called for the agency to fully investigate whether the handling of Facebook user data violated a 2011 consent decree with the FTC. The consent decree was the result of a two-year-long investigation by the agency into Facebook's privacy practices.The current investigation stems from the purchase of personal data by Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm, from a researcher who gathered it by using a Facebook app. The app asked users to take a personality test and then gathered data not only about them but about their friends.""This latest scandal will be a test case of whether [the FTC] is willing to put the public before the data gathering industry,"" says Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a privacy rights group. Chester and other advocates charge that the FTC hasn't been keeping a close enough eye on consumer privacy.But Chris Hoofnagle, who directs the Berkeley Center for Law & Technology at University of California Berkeley, says it isn't clear that Facebook violated the consent decree. According to Hoofnagle, the decree says that Facebook is not liable when users consent to giving their friends' information to Facebook.However, Hoofnagle thinks what is likely is that once the FTC starts investigating the social network it will find that it has engaged in other illegal practices. Hoofnagle says Facebook attracts developers by making it easy to get personal information. He believes that makes it very tempting for Facebook to overlook breaches of privacy so that they can keep attracting developers.In a statement, the FTC says it takes very seriously recent press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy practices of Facebook. Facebook says it will cooperate with the FTC and says it would ""appreciate the opportunity to answer questions the FTC may have.""Facebook was also hit with another lawsuit.  Cook County, Ill., is suing the company and Cambridge Analytica. Cook County's State Attorney Kimberly M. Fox says both companies violated Illinois' fraud law.  In a statement Fox said, ""Cambridge Analytica deliberately mislead Facebook users by mining — without user's knowledge — information about every Facebook 'friend' of people who took an online 'personality quiz.'""The suit also alleges that Facebook engaged in deceptive practices because it represented to the public that  strict limitations and protocols on data gathering were in place.  Yet, the suit says, Facebook knowingly allowed app developers, including Cambridge Analytica, to accumulate and mine data in excess of these policies. The Cook County lawsuit is one of several that have been filed since The New York Times and The Observer of London reported that Cambridge Analytica had gained access to private information belonging to tens of millions of Facebook users.  Among the lawsuits is one being brought by a Facebook user as a class action case for violation of user privacy.  Another case is being brought by a shareholder because of the drop in stock price after the data harvesting was revealed.  "
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/26/596921441/is-this-any-way-to-drive-an-omnibus-10-questions-about-what-just-happened","March has been teeming with news stories from Washington, from burgeoning trade wars to White House shake-ups to tales of sex scandals and shakedowns.But in the midst of it all, much of America found time to focus on last week's $1.3 trillion federal spending package. The fiscal behemoth suddenly appeared at midweek and astonishingly became law less than 48 hours later.It was Wednesday when leaders in Congress lifted the veil on the spending bill, knowing that few would be able to examine it in all its 2,200 pages of glory before the vote came on Thursday.They knew that very few citizens, news people or members of Congress would manage to read what members would be voting for just ahead of their getaway planned for Friday. (Congress is now on break until April 9.)All this might have slid by under the cover of other, juicier news. But the nation whiplashed back to attention when President Trump tweeted Friday morning that he was considering a veto of this latest, vast and lavish spending bill. Among other objections, he said no one had read it yet. And indeed, few had.But less than four hours later Trump summoned the cameras to explain why he had gone ahead and signed the bill after all — with no changes. It turned out he had done the signing earlier, shortly after sending that veto threat via tweet.Many of the president's most ardent supporters were taken by surprise. Not a few felt betrayed.(""Stabbing me in the back!"" shouted Rush Limbaugh from atop the conservative talk radio world as he watched the president's news availability. Limbaugh had assured listeners the day before that Trump could not and would not sign the spending bill.)So if any or all of this prompted questions in your mind, here are some first attempts at answers.1. Does Congress really vote on big, important bills without reading them? Short answer: Yes, it does so routinely, and for several reasons. First, ask yourself, when was the last time you read anything 2,200 pages long? If you ever did so, was the text in plain English or in ""statutory language"" full of coded references to sections of the U.S. code of laws? Would you read that many pages yourself if there was a summary available, one that could be read and interpreted by a member of your staff? And even if you wanted to read all 2,200 pages yourself, could you do it overnight?A longer answer: Members have complained for years about leaders' stratagem of forcing a snap decision on yes-or-no in the eleventh hour, even on the most consequential legislation. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has been among those saying the law should mandate a reading period before voting on big spending bills. Advocacy groups on the left and right have agreed: Congress should not rubber-stamp bills sight unseen.Back in 2009, one of the Senate Democrats fashioning what became the Affordable Care Act had to admit he had not read all the ""statutory language"" it contained. Some of his constituents were outraged, but the senator said such objections were misplaced. Just before Christmas last year, it was the Democrats protesting the rapid sequence of rollout-to-roll call for the Republican tax cut bill.2. Why wasn't there more time for reading and debate? Short answer: Because March 23 was the deadline for a new spending bill, a deadline specified in the last, stopgap bill back in February. Without a new bill to keep the dollars flowing, the government would have shut down — at least partially — at midnight Friday night.To avoid this, leaders from both parties in both the House and Senate have been working for weeks on this major set of compromises, the broad outlines of which had been agreed to last month. The White House has been represented throughout the talks by the likes of legislative director Marc Short and the emissaries of Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney. All sides did not reach the final agreement until this past week, and they did not have a product they could show their colleagues in Congress until Wednesday. At that point, there were bound to be objections on the basis of process, on the basis of policy, and on issues of secrecy versus transparency in governing.3. Why is the bill so all-encompassing and the bottom line so enormous?This bill basically flashes the green light for spending on all the discretionary functions of the federal government, which means everything except entitlements (Social Security, military and other pensions, and the interest payments on the national debt). That covers a lot of government for a whole fiscal year.The bottom line in dollars was a mind-boggling record, in part because President Trump demanded and got the biggest increase in defense spending in 15 years. Also escalating the price tag was the Democrats' insistence on rough parity for spending increases for domestic programs as well.All this new spending is, of course, entirely debt-financed. That is because previous spending levels were already higher than revenues and because the recent tax cut bill further widened that gap by reducing those revenues. The next budget's deficit will be in the neighborhood of $1 trillion for a single year.While this is apparently no longer anathema to the Republican Party leadership, in Congress or the White House, it remains deeply disturbing to individual members and to anti-debt conservatives everywhere.4. Why is all this being done right now?Short answer: It's a gargantuan do-over. Because Congress didn't do the spending process back when it was supposed to by law back in 2017. The House and Senate are required by statute to each pass 12 bills appropriating the money for all discretionary spending. They are supposed to work out the differences between their respective versions and present them to the president for him to sign them into law. That did not happen in 2017 for a variety of reasons. Since then the government has remained open via a series of stopgap spending bills called ""continuing resolutions.""The latest action is not much more than an ongoing set of orders, but at least it gets us through the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. That means the whole appropriations process (the statutory process for spending Uncle Sam's money) has to be struggled through again for the next fiscal year.5. Has anything like this ever happened before?Sadly, yes. And something very much like it may happen again very soon. Back in 1988, President Ronald Reagan dropped a 42-pound pile of paper on the speaker's lectern as he began his State of the Union speech. He said he would never sign such a bloated, omnibus spending bill again. The president was frustrated because his party did not control either chamber of Congress and had trouble negotiating with the Democrats. Appropriations would break down and at least some of the spending bills would be lumped together in an omnibus.On another occasion, Reagan had his staff stack all the pages on a hand truck for purposes of a news conference where he denounced the process. At that news conference, Reagan complained about not having line-item-veto power as president the way most governors did. Does any of this sound familiar?In fairness, Congress did step back from the constant confrontation for a time after that. From 1987 through 1994, the Democratic Congress managed the traditional process without the need for an omnibus in all but two budget cycles.But in the mid-1990s, the budget battles intensified again, this time between a Democratic president (Bill Clinton) and a Republican Congress. From 1995 through 2005, the omnibus had to be rolled out in seven years out of nine because the regular order for spending bills had fallen short.6. Trump says he won't ever sign a bill like this again. Does he mean it?In a sense he surely means it. No one would want to be jammed on a major move such as this with so little time to maneuver. On other kinds of legislation, he could let Congress leave town and confront the issue when it came back. But if you have one monster bill funding the government, the veto option becomes the government shutdown option. And that set of choices could well recur the next time the deep divisions in Congress frustrate the ""regular order"" of the spending process and result in an omnibus.7. Why wasn't a veto an option?A veto was an option, but it would mean shutting the government down. That's what happened in 1995 and 1996 when a feisty Republican Congress passed a big package of spending cuts knowing President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, did not want to accept it. Clinton used his veto, and the government shut down — the second time for weeks. Blame for the impasse seemed to settle on Congress, at least in the polls. Since then, presidents have been reluctant to force the issue if a veto meant a shutdown. 8. What's wrong with Trump calling for a line-item veto?The president can surely call for a line-item veto. Presidents regularly did so for decades. It would enable them to ""line out"" a single item in the budget the way most governors can do. But 20 years ago the issue reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which decided that such a power would violate the Constitution's view of the power of the purse. That put an end to the discussion. Of course, you could always change the Constitution. That only takes two-thirds in the House and in the Senate and ratification by three-fourths of the states. That's only happened once for a newly written amendment in the past 50 years.9. Why shouldn't Trump call for an end to the filibuster?The filibuster is a feature of the Senate and tolerated under Senate rules. It extends debate indefinitely, killing the bill. It takes 60 votes to end a filibuster. That means the minority party (currently the Democrats) can actually prevail in crucial situations. In recent years, both parties have moved to limit the filibuster to legislation (excluding the confirmation of presidential appointments). But both parties have also rejected ending the filibuster for legislation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says there are no Republican votes for ending the filibuster on legislation. Spending bills are legislation. 10. Is this any way to run a railroad? If anyone thinks so, that someone is keeping it a secret.And it's not the way Congress is supposed to spend money, either. The way it's supposed to work is an orderly process of considering a dozen separate and distinct ""appropriations bills"" that cover all discretionary spending (as opposed to entitlement payments to Social Security recipients and others).Instead, in its times of duress, Congress falls back on a massive bill appropriating enormous amount of money for a vast array of agencies and programs. Inevitably, some of those outlays are more popular than others, reviled by some and revered by others. But all have some form of constituency that has some form of power.No one member is responsible for everything in the bill, but there is always at least one someone whose fingerprints are on each individual item (usually lots of someones).So someone is getting credit for each spending decision of ""yes."" At the same time, when every ""yes"" decision has been aggregated in an amalgam of legislation, it becomes next to impossible to fix individual blame for the overall dollar result of all those yeses. And so the dollar totals continue to mount."

""He was like, 'Wow, you — you are special. You remind me of my daughter.' You know — he was like, 'You're smart and beautiful, and a woman to be reckoned with, and I like you. I like you.' ""Daniels said she had sex with Trump, despite not wanting to or being physically attracted to him, because she felt trapped once she went back to his hotel room alone. Daniels was 27 years old at the time, and Trump was 60.Still, Daniels made it clear she didn't consider herself ""a victim"" and that the sex was ""consensual."" Trump did not wear a condom, she said.The two stayed in touch after that, but did not have sex again, Daniels said.Trump has repeatedly denied that he ever had an affair with Daniels. It's unclear whether he watched the interview; but he has been known to watch 60 Minutes. Trump was in Washington when it aired, although First Lady Melania Trump remained in Florida.While he didn't acknowledge the interview, on Monday morning Trump again criticized the media in a tweet.White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah said Monday that Trump has ""consistently"" denied the claims by Daniels — including her allegations she was threatened to keep quiet — while arguing that it's her story that's been inconsistent. ""The president doesn't believe that any of the claims that Ms. Daniels made last night in the interview are accurate,"" Shah said. Daniels also detailed her efforts to talk about the affair publicly.In 2011, after agreeing to give an interview to a tabloid magazine for $15,000, Daniels says a man approached her in Las Vegas.""I was in a parking lot, going to a fitness class with my infant daughter. Taking, you know, the seats facing backwards in the backseat, diaper bag, you know, gettin' all the stuff out. And a guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,' "" Daniels said. ""And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.""More recently, Daniels and her attorney Michael Avenatti, have been fighting to void the nondisclosure agreement Daniels agreed to, that involved a $130,000 payment from Trump attorney Michael Cohen, in the days leading up to the 2016 election. Daniels filed a civil suit in California earlier this month claiming the agreement is invalid on the grounds that Trump never signed it.In regards to the payment, Shah said, ""False charges are settled out of court all the time and this is nothing outside the ordinary.""The alleged affair happened a decade ago, leading some critics to question why it's relevant now. But the Campaign Legal Center's Larry Noble says the fact that Cohen paid Daniels just days before the 2016 election could be evidence that the ""election was on their mind"" and that the money could be considered funds spent as to boost the campaign, and therefore subject to campaign finance laws.""What [Trump] did as a private citizen is not relevant to the campaign finance laws,"" Noble told NPR's Lulu Garcia Navarro. ""What he did as a candidate and what the campaign did in terms of paying somebody not to talk about what he did may be relevant to the campaign finance laws.""Trump and Cohen had dinner together Saturday night, according to The New York Times' Maggie Haberman.Daniels is one of two women suing to speak freely about past relationships with Trump.Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model, filed suit last week to break an agreement she made with American Media Inc., the parent company of The National Enquirer, for the rights to tell the story of her alleged 10-month affair with Trump.And in an unrelated case, a New York state Supreme Court judge ruled recently that a defamation case involving the president and a former contestant on The Apprentice who claims he sexually harassed her can move forward in state court, as NPR's Vanessa Romo reported.On Monday, CBS said the Daniels interview on 60 Minutes had the best ratings since the Nov. 16, 2008 episode — when then President-elect Obama and his wife Michelle appeared on the show to give their first post-election interview.NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor contributed.

Including the question is not just a bad idea — it is illegal,” Becerra wrote.The Commerce Department said in a statement that the citizenship question would be added in response to a request by the Justice Department made in December. The statement said that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross ""has determined that reinstatement of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire is necessary to provide complete and accurate census block level data.""Democrats have criticized the administration’s announcement, saying the inclusion of such a question amounts to an effort to intimidate immigrant communities and siphon money and electoral power away from them.In a San Francisco Chronicle opinion piece published Monday, Becerra and California Secretary of State Alex Padilla wrote that the inclusion of a citizenship question would be ""illegal"" and ""an extraordinary attempt by the Trump administration to hijack the 2020 census for political purposes.""According to the Commerce Department, ""almost every decennial census"" between 1820 and 1950 ""asked a question on citizenship in some form."" The department also said the citizenship question would be ""the same as the one that is asked on the yearly American Community Survey (ACS).""

Stevens retired from the court in 2010.“That simple but dramatic action would move Saturday’s marchers closer to their objective than any other possible reform,” Stevens said. “It would eliminate the only legal rule that protects sellers of firearms in the United States — unlike every other market in the world.”In his op-ed, Stevens also railed against the 2008 Supreme Court District of Columbia v. Heller decision that established an individual right to bear arms.“That decision — which I remain convinced was wrong and certainly was debatable — has provided the NRA with a propaganda weapon of immense power,” Stevens said. “Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the NRA’s ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.”There has been a renewed push for gun control since February's school shooting in Parkland, Florida. But there has been no serious push by Democrats to repeal the amendment.But speaking to conservatives last month, President Trump said he believes Democrats would try to repeal the Second Amendment if they take back control of the government.TRUMP AT CPAC: 2ND AMENDMENT AT RISK IF DEMS TAKE POWER“They will take away your Second Amendment, which we will never allow to happen,” Trump said."

But Schaaf has defended her decision, and was supported by a number of state Democrats.Fox News' Lukas Mikelionis contributed to this report.  "

One of the ex-wives, Colbie Holderness, reportedly said Porter chocked and punched her during their marriage. A photo of her bruised face was released. Porter denied the allegations and said the photo did not reflect the full story of his marriages.The abuse allegations against Porter also led to a controversy over the security clearance process in the administration. Porter had an interim security clearance despite the FBI concluding the investigation. One of his former wives reportedly told her abuse story to the FBI back in January when she was interviewed regarding Porter’s security clearance and provided the photos to the agency.The Associated Press contributed to this report."

It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.'""Pretty chilling stuff. But Daniels says she can't identify the man, and that she never went to the police. So it's impossible for others to verify her account.The same goes for Daniels' contention that she was pressured into releasing statements, as recently as January, denying any affair with Trump.""As a matter of fact,"" she told Cooper, ""the exact sentence used was, 'They can make your life hell in many different ways.'""And who is ""they""?""I'm not exactly sure who they were,"" Daniels acknowledged. ""I believe it to be Michael Cohen.""But that's speculation—and brought a strongly worded denial from the president's personal lawyer, along with a cease-and-desist letter sent to Daniels.And by the way, while Cohen admits his $130,000 payment to her in late 2016 was meant to buy her silence, Daniels said on CBS that she wanted the deal because she didn't want the story to come out and hurt her family.The bottom line is that Stormy Daniels didn't really advance the story. It's embarrassing for Trump and his family, but so far not especially damaging.At the White House, deputy press secretary Raj Shah seemed determined to give the shortest possible answers and not mention Stormy's name. He said Trump has ""clearly and consistently denied these underlying claims, and the only person who's been inconsistent is the person making the claims.""What Bill Clinton did was far worse, because he was president at the time and sullied the White House, while Trump was a celebrity businessman with almost no involvement in politics. Another key difference: While some vilified Monica Lewinsky, there was public sympathy for her as a young White House intern dealing with predatory behavior by her boss. With a porn actress and a Playboy model who used their sexuality professionally, not so much."

That’s just unacceptable and it’s contrary to federal law.”…Other cities in the county, including Yorba Linda, Buena Park, Huntington Beach and Mission Viejo are also starting to take action to voice their grievances against the state’s sanctuary laws aimed at protecting immigrants from President Trump’s immigration crackdown.In related news, on Monday, the Orange County Sheriff’s Department decided to defy the state — and obey the federal government — by making public the release dates of inmates in its jails, including illegal aliens.And more than a dozen Republican-governed states joined the federal government Monday in its lawsuit against California’s sanctuary state laws, which was filed in Sacramento earlier this month as Attorney General Jeff Sessions visited the city.The U.S. Department of Justice is suing California over three laws: the Immigrant Worker Protection Act (HB 450), the Inspection and Review of Facilities Housing Federal Detainees law (AB 103); and the California Values Act (SB 54).The battle over sanctuary cities in Orange County could have a big impact on midterm elections in California and nationwide. It could motivate Republican voters to turn out to the polls, counteracting an expected Democratic wave.Democrats are targeting several Republicans in Orange County, after Hillary Clinton carried the county narrowly in the 2016 presidential election — the first time in decades that a Democrat had won the traditionally conservative county.The California seats are considered crucial to Democrats’ goals of flipping 23 seats to regain the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives and putting House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) back in the Speaker’s chair.The National Republican Congressional Committee recently announced plans to open a new office in Irvine, meaning that both parties will have extensive field operations in Orange County, according to the Orange County Register.Joel B.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2018/03/27/juanita-broaddrick-cnn-60-minutes-never-interviewed/","During a Monday night appearance on Fox News with Sean Hannity, Juanita Broaddrick, who has credibly accused former-President Bill Clinton of rape, revealed that neither 60 Minutes nor CNN have ever interviewed her.“Have you ever been interviewed on 60 Minutes?” Hannity asked.“No, never.” Broaddrick replied. “Or CNN, or MSNBC.”The full interview with both Broaddrick and Paula Jones is embedded below.Those of us who lived through the 1990s are watching with endless amusement as our disgraced, impossible-to-shame media twists itself into knots over the fact that some 12 years ago President Trump is alleged to have had consensual, extra-marital flings with a Playboy playmate and a porn star.The reasons for this amusement are countless. To begin with, when Bill Clinton’s 12-year affair with Gennifer Flowers went public in the heat of his 1992 quest for the presidency, 60 Minutes came scurrying to his rescue. Bill and Hillary appeared on the storied news magazine show, lied about the affair, and turned his campaign around.Although Flowers had audio recordings of her telephone calls with Clinton, the very same media now obsessing over playmates and porn stars, still wrote Flowers off as an opportunistic slut and informed the voting public that personal character no longer matters when choosing a president.About five years into his presidency, and just a few rooms away from his own wife and daughter, Clinton had a sexual affair with a 22-year-old White House intern in the Oval Office. Even after he committed perjury to cover the affair up, the media actually joined the White House campaign to personally destroy Lewinsky as a dangerous stalker. After she provided DNA evidence of the affair, the media then told us this was a private matter between man and wife.In 1998, Kathleen Willey, a Democrat, accused Clinton of groping her in 1993. The media wrote her off as a disgruntled gold digger.Paula Jones won a judgment in court and a huge $850,000 settlement from Clinton after she accused Clinton of exposing himself to her. To protect Clinton, the media, primarily led by CNN, attacked her as trailer trash.Jones also appeared on Hannity Monday night and accurately described how the establishment media treated her and Clinton’s other accusers.“We did not get the same kind of coverage [Stormy Daniels is] getting. We were made fun of. We were on late night talk shows — they made fun of us. It was horrible,” Jones said. “Remember James Carville’s ‘You can drag a hundred dollar bill through a trailer park?’ I’ve never lived in a trailer park. But that’s the way they treated us, and this was a serious thing.”Yes, it was serious. And in 1999, it got as serious as these things get.Broaddrick’s  1999 claim that then-Arkansas Attorney General Clinton raped her in 1978 was so credible the media had no choice but to cover it up. It is important to recall that Broaddrick was dragged kicking and screaming into telling her story, which had only gotten out, one presumes, because she told people about the alleged rape immediately after it happened.Broaddrick refused to come forward in 1992 when Clinton was running for president, and refused for another seven years. It was only after a false story appeared about her accepting a payoff to keep silent that she decided to set the record straight.Once Broaddrick did come forward, only Lisa Myers of NBC interviewed her. In this pre-Internet era when the elitist had a bottleneck on the dissemination of information, she was never seen again. Even when her story again became valid news during Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential run, Broaddrick was ignored — ignored by 60 Minutes, by CNN, by the same  Anderson Cooper who has gleefully interviewed the porn star and the playmate over Trump’s alleged consensual affairs for 60 Minutes and CNN.The day Cooper’s dud of an interview with Story Daniels aired, Broaddrick tweeted Cooper directly, “HEY 60 MINUTES @andersoncooper HOW ABOUT HAVING ME ON To Discuss my Book, “You’d Better Put Some Ice On That”. ….What Bill Clinton said to me after he Raped Me.”HEY 60 MINUTES @andersoncooper  HOW ABOUT HAVING ME ON To  Discuss my Book, “You’d Better Put Some Ice On That”. ….What Bill Clinton said to me after he Raped Me. https://t.co/9vsEz8YdD0— Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) March 25, 2018The next day, Broaddrick retweeted this with the comment, “Yep, that about sums it up.”Why we hate the Media:Paula Jones: Not believableKathleen Willey: Not believableGennifer Flowers: Not believableMonica Lewinsky: Not believableJuanita Broddrick: Not believablePornstar Stormy Daniels: Impeccable integrity, 24/7 coverage.#StormyDanielsDay— Joel Fischer (@JFNYC1) March 26, 2018“Have you heard from Anderson?” Hannity asked Broaddrick Monday night.“No,” she replied.While we watch our shameless media with amusement, others are not so amused, and understandably so. Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

The main and only task is to minimize risks, prevent the conflict from turning into an even more militarised phase.”Public Anger at ‘Diabolical’ Response as Authorities Only Admit Risk to Public Days After Salisbury Attack https://t.co/lnR6hDNLEm— Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) March 12, 2018Repeating his claim and asserting that it was no exaggeration that the West and the Federation had entered a new Cold War, Lukyanow stated the situation was “in reality much worse” than 40 years ago, as in the present state of “[utterly complete] mutual alienation” there were no “clearly defined rules of conduct — formal and informal” as there had been between 1945 and 1989.Western nations including the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada, and 14 European Union member states have expelled Russian diplomats — with around 100 staff having been sent home so far.The expulsions have come in the aftermath of the poisoning and attempted murder of Sergei and Julia Skripal with a chemical nerve agent in Salisbury, England, in March. The British government and her allies have blamed the Russian government for the attack — a charge with Russia denies.https://t.co/PbkUt7UXDq— Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) March 26, 2018The Russian government itself has vowed to respond to the expulsions, with the BBC reporting the remarks of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov who took aim at the United States, stating: “Certainly, we will not tolerate such impudence… When one or two diplomats are being expelled from this or that country, all the while whispering apologies in our ear, we know for sure that this is a result of colossal pressure, colossal blackmail, which unfortunately is Washington’s main tool now on the international area.”Lavrov’s foreign ministry is now considering potential retaliation measures.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/27/williams-christian-activist-pro-trump-evangelicals-practice-slaveholder-religion/","Evangelicals who support President Donald Trump are unwittingly perpetuating the “slaveholder religion” of their forefathers, declares Christian activist Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove in a controversial interview with Religion News Service (RNS).Slaveholders who called themselves Christians had a series of justifications for owning slaves, Wilson-Hartgrove observes, similar to evangelicals’ justification of Trump’s “extremism.”“I feel like almost every week, there’s something in this administration that leads the media to ask, ‘Will Trump’s faith advisors still stand by him in the face of this allegation, or this reality?’ And we have seen that the answer is yes,” Wilson-Hartgrove said.“There is no moral failing or questionable activity that is going to cause people who call themselves evangelical Christians and who are backing him to turn away,” he added.It is curious that Wilson-Hartgrove, who also identifies as an evangelical Christian, has no moral qualms about comparing Trump supporters to slave-owners without adducing any evidence to corroborate such surprising equivalency.One must assume that on referring to Trump’s “moral failings” and “questionable activities,” Wilson-Hartgrove is alluding to recent scandals involving an alleged 2006 relationship with porn star Stormy Daniels.Supposing that the allegations are true, Wilson-Hartgrove apparently believes that evangelicals should stop supporting or advising the president because he is guilty of the sin of adultery. This, in turn, suggests that in his mind, true Christians should only support political leaders who lead morally immaculate lives—a remarkably small group.To date, no Christian leader has attempted to justify the president’s purported sexual misconduct, but they have apparently believed that there was little to be gained by cutting off relations with Mr. Trump for personal sins he may have committed before running for office.Oddly, in his insistence that evangelicals should ostracize Trump in the name of Christianity, Wilson-Hartgrove never mentions any of Trump’s actual policies or political decisions but speaks only of his past “moral failings,” which seems a strange way to evaluate the presidency or its effect on the nation.Trump’s political stance on issues that are generally considered important to Christians—such as religious freedom and the right to life—seem to carry little weight in Wilson-Hartgrove’s vilification of his brother evangelicals, whom he disparagingly calls “Trumpvangelicals.”Yet if evangelicals had supported Hillary Clinton for the presidency, as Wilson-Hartgrove seems to think they should have, they would have been backing a candidate who openly supported abortion on demand and wished to run roughshod over religious freedom. Would not this have been a “slaveholder religion” of a far more sinister strain?In carrying on the “slaveholder” theme, Wilson-Hartgrove continually harkens back to race.It has been the author’s contention that racism was the overriding cause of Donald Trump’s election to the White House, fueled by white anger after eight years of Obama.“It’s absolutely the case we couldn’t have imagined Donald Trump becoming president without first having an African-American president,” Wilson-Hartgrove said shortly after the 2016 election.“No one wants to think of themselves as racist. So they say the problem was not that Obama was black but that he was liberal, which to them equals immoral and ungodly,” Wilson-Hartgrove said. Yet in the final analysis, “it had everything to do with race.”It is hard to understand how President Obama got elected in the first place, or reelected four years later, if racism were the driving force behind the voting choices of half the U.S. population, but such considerations seem irrelevant to the narrative that Wilson-Hartgrove wishes to propose.The RNS column running the interview with Mr. Wilson-Hartgrove is appropriately titled “Flunking Sainthood.”While Jesus asked many things of his followers, setting the bar so high as to command them to be perfect as their heavenly Father is perfect, he notably also counseled them to remove the plank in their own eye before attempting to take the speck from their neighbor’s.With this in mind, perhaps Mr. Wilson-Hartgrove should be a little more circumspect in his condemnation of his brother evangelicals and their motives for supporting the president—at least if he intends to do so in the name of Jesus.Follow Thomas D.

In December, Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, prompting Abbas to rule out the US as a future Mideast broker.Maas said Monday that peace efforts without the US “would be difficult.”Later, in Jerusalem, Maas professed his country’s friendship with Israel, despite differences over the two-state solution, which Netanyahu no longer endorses, and the Iranian nuclear issue.“Our views differ, but first and foremost we are friends,” he said. “We want to hear from our friends their concerns and fears, and therefore I have come here.”Netanyahu has been an outspoken critic of the 2015 nuclear deal, and urged the international community to “fix it or nix it.” He says the deal does not have sufficient safeguards to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.Given Trump’s mid-May deadline, US negotiators have been working with Britain, France, and Germany on a follow-on pact that would address Trump’s three major complaints.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2018/03/27/two-charged-with-anti-semitic-murder-of-elderly-french-jewish-woman/","PARIS (AFP) – Two people have been charged with the murder of an 85-year-old French Jewish woman, who was stabbed and whose body was then set alight in a crime being treated as anti-Semitic, a judicial source said Tuesday.Mireille Knoll, who escaped a mass roundup of Jews in Paris during World War II, was found dead in her apartment in eastern Paris on Friday by firefighters called to extinguish a blaze.An autopsy showed she had been stabbed several times before a fire was started in the apartment. The two suspects, who were taken into custody, have also been charged with aggravated robbery, the source said.The death of the frail octogenarian described by neighbours as very quiet has shocked the Jewish community, coming a year after an Orthodox Jewish woman in her sixties was thrown out the window of her Paris flat by a neighbour shouting “Allahu Akhbar” (God is greatest).On Monday, investigators said they believed Knoll’s killing was related to her religion after initially saying they were “not excluding any hypothesis”. They also said the suspects faced charges of aggravated robbery.One of the suspects is a neighbour in his twenties whom she knew well and who had visited her that day, Knoll’s son, who did not wish to be named, told AFP.A police source said the suspect had convictions for rape and sexual assault.The second suspect, aged 21, has a history of violent robbery.He was in the apartment building on the day of Knoll’s death and his name was given to police by the first suspect, a police source said.Reacting on Twitter President Emmanuel Macron condemned the “dreadful” killing and reiterated his determination to fighting anti-Semitism.– Escaped deportation –Knoll managed to escape the notorious 1942 roundup of more than 13,000 Jews in Paris by fleeing with her mother to Portugal when she was 10.After the war she returned to the French capital and married a Holocaust survivor, who died in the early 2000s.The CRIF umbrella grouping of French Jewish organisations on Monday urged “the fullest transparency” by the authorities investigating Knoll’s murder “so that the motive of this barbarous crime is known as quickly as possible.”Last month, a judge confirmed that the April 2017 murder of Sarah Halimi, the woman who was thrown out of her window, was motivated by anti-Semitism.Jewish groups had reacted angrily to the investigators’ delay in declaring that killing an anti-Semitic act.Halimi’s murder reignited the debate over anti-Semitism in working-class districts in France, where Jews have been targeted in several deadly jihadist attacks in recent years.France’s half-a-million-plus Jewish community is the largest in Europe but has been hit by a wave of emigrations to Israel in the past two decades, partly due to the emergence of a virulent strain of anti-Semitism in predominantly immigrant neighbourhoods.In 2011, an Islamist gunman shot dead three children and a teacher and a Jewish school in the southwestern city of Toulouse.Four years later, an associate of the two brothers who massacred a group of cartoonists at satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo killed four people in a hostage-taking at a Jewish supermarket in Paris.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/03/27/chinese-police-arrest-underground-bishop-faithful-rome/","Chinese police arrested Bishop Giuseppe Guo Xijin of Mindong Monday night, just prior to the celebration of Holy Week, the most solemn period in the Christian calendar.In a show of state power over the Church, officials arrived to the diocesan chancery around ten o’clock Monday night and took the bishop away along with the chancellor of the Diocese, Father Xu, according to a report Tuesday from Asianews, the official outlet of the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions.Bishop Guo was called to the Chinese Office for Religious Affairs at 3:00pm Monday, where he was questioned by officials for more than two hours. He returned to the bishop’s residence at 7:00pm and prepared his luggage as if preparing to leave. Police showed up at 10:00pm and arrested him.Although the contents of the bishop’s discussions with communist authorities is unknown, according to some of the faithful, the bishop was arrested for refusing to concelebrate the liturgy during the Easter holidays with the illicit bishop Zhan Silu.Last October, the Vatican issued instructions to Bishop Guo to yield his post as bishop of Mindong to the government-approved Bishop Vincenzo Zhan Silu and to take up the role of his auxiliary, as a way of preparing for diplomatic relations between the Vatican and China. In December, a Vatican delegation led by Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli visited Bishop Zhan, one of seven illegitimate bishops waiting for Vatican recognition and the man slated to replace Bishop Guo as the new bishop of Mindong.On December 14, the Patriotic Catholic Association—the parallel “Catholic” church created by the Communist party—and the Council of Bishops issued a five-year plan aimed at “Sinicizing” the Catholic Church. The plan demands that all religions submit to the leadership of the Communist Party. Neither the Patriotic Association nor the Council of Bishops is recognized by Rome.China’s highest ranking Catholic prelate, Cardinal Joseph Zen, published an open letter to the media in late January, accusing the Vatican of “selling out” the Church by caving in to demands of the Communist leaders.The 86-year-old cardinal has been a vocal critic of recent diplomatic efforts by the Vatican to curry the favor of Chinese leaders. For years, members of the Chinese underground Church have suffered persecution for their faithfulness to Rome, and for their refusal to abandon the Church and join the state-controlled Patriotic Association.Zen urged Pope Francis last year not to make a deal with the Chinese government that would undermine the sacrifice and fidelity of the underground Catholic Church in the country.“We are very much worried because it seems that the Vatican is going to make a very bad agreement with China,” the cardinal said at the time.Pope Francis “is really naïve” and “doesn’t know the Chinese communists,” he said.“So, do I think that the Vatican is selling out the Catholic Church in China?” Zen asked in his open letter in January. “Yes, definitely, if they go in the direction which is obvious from all what they are doing in recent years and months.”At this same time last year Bishop Guo was arrested by police just prior to the Easter holidays, to prevent him from celebrating the festivities with his flock.

Her report led to Jewish community leaders calling the findings a “whitewash” and a “fraud”.Chakrabarti was nominated for a peerage by Mr. Corbyn just a few weeks afterwards.All this follows in the wake of polling which shows that British Jews have been abandoning the Labour Party since the election of Mr. Corbyn, and a recent survey revealed that four in five believe that Labour harbours anti-Semites in its ranks.Pictures taken of Monday’s rally against anti-Semitism in the Labour Party appear below:Members of the Jewish community hold a protest against Britain’s opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn and anti-semitism in the Labour party, outside the British Houses of Parliament in central London..  (TOLGA AKMEN/AFP/Getty Images)Placards were held high as a protest against Britain’s opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn and anti-semitism in the Labour party took to the streets outside the British Houses of Parliament.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/03/27/top-vatican-official-embraces-sinicization-christian-faith-china/","The Vatican’s Foreign Minister said that the two principles of “Sinicization” and “inculturation” are the key to the future of Christianity in China, as the Vatican reportedly draws nearer to a historic agreement with the Chinese government.“Sinicization,” or assimilation into a Chinese culture and worldview, has been a leitmotiv of the government under Xi Jinping, who has sought progressively greater control over all institutions active on Chinese soil, notably religious institutions.President Xi has made it clear that all religions active in China must be “Sinicized,” or rendered compatible with the beliefs and programs of Communist China and purged of western influence and control.Archbishop Paul Richard Gallagher, the Secretary for Relations with States within the Holy See’s Secretariat of State, embraced the concept in his opening address at an international conference on Christianity in China, held at the Jesuit-run Gregorian University in Rome last week.it seems clear that the mission of the Church in China today is one of being “fully Catholic and genuinely Chinese,” making the Gospel of Jesus available to all and placing it at the service of the common good, Gallagher said.As the fruit of the seed of the Gospel, the Catholic community in China is developing in a manner corresponding to its “genetic identity,” the archbishop said, assuming “characteristics proper to the local culture in which it was sown.”When considering mission and theological reflection, he said, “two expressions or, more precisely, two principles stand out, which should interact with each other, namely ‘Sinicization’ and ‘inculturation.’ I am convinced that an important intellectual and pastoral challenge arises in an almost natural way from the bringing together of these two terms, which indicate two real visions of the world.”“From these two visions, it should be possible to work out the coordinates of an authentic Christian presence in China, which could present the special nature and the newness of the Gospel in a context deeply rooted in the specific identity of the age-old Chinese culture,” he said.The ruling Communist party and President Xi Jinping have made their understanding of Sinicization abundantly clear.In late 2016, the Chinese Communist party reaffirmed the absolute independence of the nationalized Catholic church from Rome, insisting that the church in China adhere to a program of “self-governance.”In an official statement released after the 2016 National Congress of Chinese Catholic Representatives in Beijing, participants reasserted the autonomy of the Chinese Catholic Church from Rome.“Sticking to the principle of independence and self-governance as well as a system of national congresses embodies the self-esteem and confidence of the Catholic Church in China. They are the foundation of the church’s existence,” the statement read.Under the guise of local church “autonomy,” Beijing has sought greater control over the Catholic Church in China, insisting that bishops be named by the local Chinese Catholic community under the auspices of the Communist party. It has also refused to acknowledge the authority of the Pope in ecclesiastical decisions, claiming that as head of a foreign state, the Pope has no right to interfere in local matters.The Catholic Church in China has been split into underground and open communities since 1958, with the latter going by the title of the Patriotic Catholic Association under immediate control of the Communist party.As Beijing has tightened its grip on religious practice, more and more Christians have opted out of the official, state-recognized church and headed underground.Approximately six million Catholics have refused to join churches recognized by the Communist party and have chosen instead to worship in illegal “house churches,” where they can remain loyal to the Vatican.In the 2016 meeting of the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and the Chinese Bishops Conference, described as a “staged theatrical representation” rather than a true assembly of a community of faith, senior Communist party leader Yu Zhengsheng told participants that Catholics should “run their church independently and better integrate it into society.”“The church should adhere to the principles of self-administration, run religious affairs independently and guide believers to adhere to the Sinicization path of the religion,” he said, referring to a Chinese identity free of western influence.Yu’s words were echoed by Patriotic Bishop Ma Yinglin, who said in his closing speech that the Chinese Catholic Church will stick to its Sinicization path, conform to socialist society and align itself closely with the Communist Party of China with General Secretary Xi Jinping at its head.Bishop Ma, who was excommunicated by the Vatican in 2006, was re-elected as president of the Bishops Conference of Catholic Church of China.At the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Congress last October, the head of the umbrella agency that oversees religion insisted that “socialist core values” must be at the heart of any religious faith active in China.The Catholic Church, on the contrary, has rejected socialism in all its forms as incompatible with the Christian faith. “Whether considered as a doctrine, or an historical fact, or a movement, Socialism, if it remains truly Socialism,” wrote Pope Pius XI, “cannot be reconciled with the teachings of the Catholic Church because its concept of society itself is utterly foreign to Christian truth.”Zhang Yijiong, the head of the United Front Work Department (UFWD), said that the Communist Party had a long way to go to “sinicize” religion—make it more Chinese. This required, Zhang argued, harsh measures to prevent anyone from “taking advantage of religion to harm national security” and “endangering national unity.”On February 1, 2018, a series of strict regulations overhauling religious practice in the officially communist country went into effect, the product of China’s State Administration for Religious Affairs (SARA).The new norms were described in one report as consciously intended to “annihilate underground communities” and “suffocate official communities.” Penalties for nonconformance include the imposition of massive fines for persons associated with underground religious communities not authorized by the state, which have no legal standing in the country.The regulations also mandate that no one under 18 years of age is allowed to enter a church building, as part of an effort to separate youth from Christian education and practice.Earlier this month, a Chinese bishop of the government-controlled Catholic Patriotic Association declared that loyal citizenship must take priority over Christian faith.Bishop Peter Fang Jianping of Tangshan said that Catholics should give their allegiance to President Xi Jinping “because we, as citizens of the country, should first be a citizen and then have religion and beliefs,” according to a recent report.Fang, who was ordained a bishop in China without Vatican approval in 2000 and later legitimized by the Holy See, is a member of the National People’s Congress (NPC), the Chinese parliament that on March 11 voted to eliminate presidential term limits.The Chinese government has branded all religion a national security threat, while singling out Christianity as a paramount concern. Christianity has seen such a dramatic surge in popularity that Christians reportedly outnumber Communist Party members in the country.Despite China’s claims of “religious freedom,” the U.S. State Department as well as numerous watchdog groups consider China to be guilty of systemic religious oppression.Follow Thomas D.

He has taken some encouraging incremental positive steps, but he needs to make the final, courageous leap.Press reports have indicated the Saudis and Israelis have been quietly working together to confront the threat posed by Iran. For the Saudis, Iran truly poses an existential threat even if it does not possess nuclear weapons. Iran is actively trying to undermine Saudi stability by provoking Shiites in the kingdom to oppose the government, by arming and funding rebels in Yemen who have directly attacked Saudi Arabia and its allies in that country, and by trying to create a Shiite crescent across the Middle East to challenge Sunni-led countries such as Saudi Arabia.The Saudis have also been the most outspoken advocates of taking tougher measures to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. While antisemites and other detractors of Israel continue to claim falsely that Israel is trying to provoke the United States to go to war with Iran, the only country that called for military action to stop Iran’s genocidal intentions was Saudi Arabia.While MBS was in the United States, he said that if Iran does get the bomb, it will develop its own nuclear weapons. It was a reminder of what many critics of Obama’s disastrous nuclear agreement said from the beginning: namely, that allowing Iran to continue its nuclear ambitions would encourage nuclear proliferation in the region.Like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, MBS believes the nuclear deal is fatally flawed and requires major changes. With the excellent John Bolton now joining the Administration as National Security Advisor, we can expect to see greater pressure to finally repudiate the catastrophic Iran nuclear deal and stop Iran from becoming a nuclear power.The Saudis and Israelis also share an interest in reforming the Palestinian Authority away from terrorism and incitement. Many surmise that the Saudis have never cared much for the Palestinians and have mostly paid lip service to their cause. In the past, the Saudis feared improving ties with Israel before an agreement was reached with the Palestinians because of the fear of upheaval in the kingdom and suffering the fate of Anwar Sadat, who was assassinated after making peace with Israel. The Saudi public, however, has become more inward focused, and is looking to improve its own welfare. The lack of reaction to the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, ignoring Palestinian calls for protests, was one indication of the change in perception of the centrality of the Palestinian issue.In the past, the Saudis harmed the peace process by funding Hamas and the Palestine Liberation Organization, and encouraging their violence against Israel. But they have further undermined peace and stability in the region by their refusal to normalize ties with Israel. Yet recent events – from Saudi Arabia allowing an Air India flight to Israel to fly in its airspace, to MBS publicly comparing Iranian leader Khameini to Hitler, to the constant media buzz of military cooperation between Saudi Arabia and Israel – would indicate that MBS might want to take the country in a new direction. The specter of a Saudi ruler publicly labeling the man calling for the annihilation of Israel Hitler was simply astonishing.A major reason the Palestinians believe they do not have to recognize the permanence of Israel as a Jewish State is that they think that an international boycott will force Israel to capitulate to their demands and will eventually disappear. The Arab League boycott, which predated the establishment of Israel, and was led for years by the Saudis, failed to destroy Israel. The Palestinian-inspired “Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions” (BDS) movement is proving equally futile.The Palestinians have effectively held other Arab states hostage to their demands. If the Saudis recognize Israel — and, ideally, other states follow suit — it will force the Palestinians to come to terms with Israel as a permanent and powerful presence which they must cease to demonize.Just as the U.S. announcement regarding Jerusalem was a recognition of reality, so too would Saudi recognition of Israel. If it wasn’t so diplomatically serious, it would be comical that the kingdom pretends the Jewish State does not exist after 70 years of Israeli independence. The Saudi boycott of Israel has never seriously harmed Israel, but the Saudis have missed out on the opportunity to learn from Israeli innovations and share their technological advancements in areas such as electronics, desalination, and medicine. And now that MBS is making efforts to bring global investment into Saudi Arabia, acceptance of Israel would establish him as a global statesman with bold and courageous vision.It was an important gesture to let Air India fly above Saudi Arabia en route to Tel Aviv. But the Saudis deny El Al the same opportunity, and thus make flights to India on Israel’s national airline more than two hours longer. MBS should immediately rectify this inequity.Saudi recognition of Israel, even if it were to begin in a limited but public manner, would put the appropriate pressure on the Palestinians to finally move away from the incitement and sponsorship of terror. The Palestinians, of course, are headed in the opposite direction. Last week alone they took the unbelievable and disgusting step of trying to have the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, labeled a terrorist after Mahmoud Abbas himself called the Ambassador a “son of a dog.” Such revolting displays of antisemitism should be condemned by every Arab leader, especially those that enjoy a close relationship with the U.S. as major allies. The abominable attacks against an American ambassador – and one who enjoys a close relationship with the President of the United States – are an attack on America itself. And it’s the Arab leadership that must deliver that message to Abbas.Publicly, it appears the Palestinians have not received the message. They say they will have nothing to do with the Trump administration’s peace initiative, Abbas has refused to engage in negotiations for nearly a decade, and he continues to hope the international community will coerce Israel to satisfy his unreasonable demands.The Palestinians need to be shocked out of their fantasies. MBS can do it by recognizing Israel and, in the process, help his kingdom by working with Israelis to neutralize the Iranian threat and take advantage of the technical expertise that Israel has to offer his people.I am not naïve. I recognize that a Saudi leader recognizing Israel would be, in diplomatic terms, nearly as big a step as that taken by Neil Armstrong on the moon. But is this not precisely the kind of bold and aggressive leadership that MBS is trying to project to the world? That he is a leader of a new generation of Muslims who wish to restore a humanitarian face to one of the world’s great religions — a leader who has publicly proclaimed that women are the equal of men? And a leader who claims that he wishes to uproot corruption and religious extremism from his borders?Saudi recognition of, and normalization with, Israel would achieve all these things in one swoop, and would confirm to the world that MBS is not just posturing, but is prepared to take daring risks to stabilize the Middle East and push back against his country’s real enemies, which are not the Jews but the Khameini regime in Tehran.Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, “America’s Rabbi,” whom the Washington Post calls “the most famous Rabbi in America” is the international best-selling author of 31 books including his most recent, The Israel Warrior.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/26/big-victory-for-president-trump-commerce-department-puts-u-s-citizenship-question-back-on-census/","In a historic moment for President Trump’s administration, Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross has announced that a question asking United States residents if they are American citizens will be placed on the 2020 Census.Ross made the announcement late on Monday evening, writing in a statement:After a thorough review of the legal, program, and policy considerations, as well as numerous discussions with Census Bureau leadership, Members of Congress, and interested stakeholders, Secretary Ross has determined that reinstatement of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire is necessary to provide complete and accurate census block level data.Since 1950, the citizenship question has not been asked on the full Census, leaving the nation without an exact estimate of how many citizens are in the country and how many noncitizens and illegal aliens are in the country.Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach told Breitbart News that the move to put the citizenship question back on the Census was a historic victory for Trump’s administration and one that will result in more accurate unemployment data and a better estimate of the illegal alien population.“This is one of Trump’s most important accomplishments as president,” Kobach told Breitbart News in a late night interview. “This is right up there with Neil Gorsuch being appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court.”Kobach was one of the leading voices in the country for putting the citizenship question back on the Census, even writing Ross, himself, to request that the question be added to give the nation’s citizens more transparency on how many noncitizens and illegal aliens are living throughout the country.“It allows a sovereign nation to know how many citizens it has,” Kobach told Breitbart News. “That’s the craziest part of our Census since 1950. Now we will have an actual count of citizens. That’s one of the most basic things a sovereign nation should be able to do, along with enforcing its borders.”Kobach has previously explained in detail how the lack of knowledge surrounding how many citizens are in the country has led to massive vote dilution in states like California that have an enormous illegal alien population:Right now, congressional districts are drawn up simply based on the number of warm bodies in each district. Not only are legal aliens counted, but illegal aliens are counted too. As a result, citizens in a district with lots of illegal aliens have more voting power than citizens in districts with few illegal aliens. [Emphasis added]Think of it this way. There are about 710,000 people in each congressional district. But, if half of the district is made up of illegal aliens, then there are only 355,000 citizens in the district. The value of each citizen’s vote in such a district is twice as high. [Emphasis added]Left-wing politicians, the open borders lobby, and former President Obama’s Census Bureau director have claimed that asking U.S. residents if they are citizens would be unconstitutional and a “risk.”As Breitbart News reported, newly released research revealed that the open borders lobby’s claim that foreign-born U.S. residents would be scared off from answering the 2020 Census if the citizenship question was added was unfounded and unlikely.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/26/transgender-pentagon-says-fewer-than-25-soldiers-requested-genitalia-surgery/","A Pentagon survey shows fewer than 25 servicemembers have used former President Barack Obama’s transgender rules to request free cosmetic genital surgery, even though progressive activists have argued for several years that 14,000 people in the military want to be treated as members of the other sex.The 25 people represent just 0.0012 percent of the 2.1 million soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines in the active and reserve military. That transgender percentage is just one person among every 84,000 servicemembers.The Pentagon report also noted that only 388 military members  — or 0.0184 percent of the military — are taking opposite-sex hormones. That percentage is just one person among every 5,400 servicemembers.The data was released in a courtroom-ready 44-page study which explains the Pentagon’s decision to deep-six Obama’s pro-transgender rules. Those rules allowed soldiers to declare they have an opposite-sex “gender identity,” and then change their “gender marker” in military personnel records. This process would have allowed service members to flip their legal sex in the military without undergoing any surgery, largely eliminating the military’s biology-based legal distinctions between male and female in fitness tests, shared housing, sexual privacy, deployment rules and combat expectations.The new Pentagon policy discards the “Gender Identity” rule and revives the normal reliance on biology to determine a person’s sex, saying t the military favors “maintaining a bright line [between the two sexes] based on biological sex.”In the report’s section on transgender numbers, Pentagon study said:… of the 424 approved Service member [transgender] treatment plans available for study, 388 included cross-sex hormone treatment, but only 34 non-genital sex reassignment surgeries and one genital surgery have been completed thus far. Only 22 Service members have requested a waiver for a genital sex reassignment surgery.This very low rate of surgery — despite the massive media coverage — is a close match to the very low rates of transgender surgery outside the military.Only about 4,118 Americans surgically altered their bodies in hospitals from 2000 to 2014 to appear like members of the opposite sex, according to a peer-reviewed study published February 2018 by the Journal of the American Medical Association. In percentage terms, the 4,118 people who underwent surgery is just 0.0013 percent of the 320 million people who live in the United States, according to the study. The JAMA report notes that roughly one-quarter of the estimated 4,118 people who underwent the surgeries recorded in the study did not have surgery on their genitals.The Pentagon report slammed the vague guidelines pushed by transgender activists about who should be classified as male or female:The concept of gender transition is so nebulous, however, that drawing any line — except perhaps at a full sex reassignment surgery — would be arbitrary, not to mention at odds with current medical practice, which allows for a wide range of individualized treatment. In any event, [national] rates for genital surgery are exceedingly low — 2% of [female] transgender men and 10% of [male] transgender women. Only up to 25% of surveyed transgender persons report having had some form of transition-related surgery [such as breast reduction or facial cosmetic surgery]. The RAND study estimated that such rates “are typically only around 20 percent, with the exception of chest surgery among female-to-male transgender individuals” …Low rates of full sex reassignment surgery and the otherwise wide variation of transition-related treatment, with all the challenges that entails for privacy, fairness, and safety, weigh in favor of maintaining a bright line based on biological sex — not gender identity … After all, a person’s biological sex is generally ascertainable through objective means. Moreover, this approach will ensure that biologically-based standards will be applied uniformly to all Service members of the same biological sex. Standards that are clear, coherent, objective, consistent, predictable, and uniformly applied enhance good order, discipline, steady leadership, and unit cohesion, which in turn, ensure military effectiveness and lethality.The endorsement of a “bright line based on biological sex” is anathema to the transgender movement, which was hoping that Obama’s rules would help them persuade judges to blur the legal and civic distinctions between male and female.Instead of relying on biology to identify each person as male or female, transgender activists want each person’s legal sex to be determined by their personal but unverifiable feeling of “gender identity,” not by their verifiable biology or genitalia. This focus on “gender identity” means that a person can be legally male in the morning and legally female in the afternoon.If implemented via courtrooms or legislatures, the “gender identity” rule will make it practically impossible to maintain single-sex sports competitions, community awards, civic associations or even single-sex showers and bathrooms, or to tailor education and cultural events for boys or girls.Conservative and feminist groups, however, endorse the Pentagon’s bright line policy because it recognizes the distinctions between the equal, different and complementary priorities, capabilities and preferences held by men and women.In public debates, transgender activists prefer to play up claims about the total number of people who say they are transgender — and to downplay the number who actually undergo surgery to reshape their bodies. A 2014 study often cited by the media, for example, declared the military had a population of 15,500 transgender people but did not estimate how many took hormones or underwent surgery.Transgender groups, however, will acknowledge the low rate of surgery when they are trying to minimize the taxpayer costs of the ideology. An August 2017 report by the pro-transgender Palm Center advocacy group acknowledged the low rate of surgeries as it sought to minimize the Pentagon’s financial costs:Belkin estimated in 2015 that 188 transgender service members would require transition-related care (surgery and/or hormones) in any given year and that the total cost to provide such care would be $5.6 million. In 2016, RAND estimated that between 49 and 420 transgender service members would require transition-related care (surgery and/or hormones) in any given year and that the total cost to provide such care would be between $2.4 million and $8.4 million …The transgender ideology is deeply unpopular, especially among women and parents. In 2017, Obama told NPR that his promotion of the transgender ideology made it easier for Donald Trump to win the presidency.In practice, the transgender ideology requires women to silently accept men who claim to have a female “gender identity” in women’s bathrooms, showers, and sports clubs. It also requires parents to stand aside when their children decide to begin a lifetime of risky and self-sterilizing medical treatments to help them pretend they are members of the opposite sex.Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex, even as they also reject the transgender ideology’s claim that a person’s legal sex is determined by their feeling of “gender identity,” not by biology.Despite the huge expense, conflict, and damage to young people, the gender ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male. Also, officials in New York and various universities have threatened to penalize people who do not refer to men as if they are women, and several judges have declared that Pentagon officials must accept recruits who want to change their sex.The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of “gender identity” has already attacked and cracked many of the popular social rules which help Americans manage the cooperation and competition among and between complementary, different and equal men and women.These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, health outcomes, women’s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, and children’s sexual privacy.   MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/26/epa-leaning-towards-rolling-back-obama-era-auto-emissions-standards/","The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) tentatively concluded that the agency will roll back future vehicle emissions standards set by the Obama administration.The Wall Street Journal reported that the EPA drafted a “final determination” that outlines arguments requiring automakers to reduce emissions standards so that automobiles sold by car companies average more than 50 miles per gallon by 2025.The EPA delivered the draft to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) last week; the agency faces an April 1 deadline to determine whether to loosen the auto emissions rules, leave them unchanged, or increase the emissions standards.Liz Bowman, an EPA spokeswoman, said, “The draft determination has been sent to OMB and is undergoing interagency review. A final determination will be signed by April 1, 2018, consistent with the original timeline.”Bowman did not discuss the contents of the draft EPA determination memo.Automakers believe that the Obama-era emissions standards remain far too onerous in an era of low gas prices. Lower fuel prices spurred Americans to purchase less fuel-efficient pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) over electric and hybrid cars, which emit fewer carbon emissions compared to pickup trucks.Pickup trucks and SUVs make up 60 percent of the American auto market, while electric vehicles amount to only one percent of domestic auto sales.California received a waiver from the Obama administration to set its own vehicle standards; the Donald Trump administration set a review of future standards, arguing that California should not set nationwide policy on emissions standards.Mitch Bailwol, the president and chief executive of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said in a comment to the Wall Street Journal that he remains committed to one national emissions standard compared to California’s separate authority to establish emissions standards.“We can’t comment on a determination we haven’t seen, but remain absolutely convinced that one national program is the preferred policy path,” Bainwol argued.Bainwol wrote a letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, detailing how 96.5 percent of new passenger vehicles cannot comply with the Obama-era 54.5 miles per gallon fuel efficiency standard. The Alliance president added that only some hybrid, plug-in electric, and fuel-cell vehicles, which amount to only 3.5 percent of America’s new passenger vehicles can comply with the rigorous Obama-era emissions standard.The Alliance for Automakers argued that if the Obama emissions standards were left unchanged, the domestic auto industry could lose up to 1.1 million jobs due to reduced vehicle sales, particularly impacting low-income households.The Alliance contends that complying with the Obama-era emissions standards would cost $200 billion, eliminate jobs, and raise vehicle prices.The Alliance of Automobile Automakers represents roughly a dozen automakers, including General Motors, Ford, and Toyota.GM chief executive Mary Barra met with EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao earlier in March.A GM spokeswoman said that the automaker “reconfirmed our priorities for modernizing fuel economy standards, which is the need for one national set of requirements and the need to comprehend new technology developments like increased shared and autonomous electric vehicles.”California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown called Trump’s decision to review the Obama-era emissions standards a “gift to polluters” in a letter to Pruitt last year.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

And the Daily Wire noted that, when the last 14 years of search data for the term “NRA membership” was examined, it showed “searches for the phrase spiked higher over the weekend than … in response to the gun control push and campaign against the NRA after Sandy Hook.”Google searches for the term “NRA membership” rose significantly, but briefly, following the heinous attack on Sandy Hook and the subsequent gun control push. However, that surge was well beneath the one that followed Democrats’ immediate attempts to use the Parkland school shooting for gun control.Ironically, there was no surge of searches for “NRA membership” following the April 16, 2007, Virginia Tech shooting. Thirty-two innocents were killed in that horrific crime, but the Daily Wire opines that it did not lend itself to a gun control campaign because the attacker used handguns instead of an AR-15, AK-47, or similar rifle.While handguns are far more prevalent for criminal use than AR-15s, AK-47s, or any other rifle, it should be noted that even knives are used in more homicides than “assault weapons.” FBI crime stats say that over four times as many people were stabbed to death in 2016 than were killed with rifles of any kind.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

She said, “When you think about all the different places that failed, starting with Sheriff Scott Israel, with the FBI, with the local police who had been to this house 29 times, I didn’t hear any of that this weekend during these very forceful demonstrations.”Kashuv responded:Gun control won’t solve this issue. We’ve seen that we have to hold our government accountable, we have to. The main reason why school shootings continuously happen is that our government is not doing its job. It’s clear that when the government does do its job these shootings don’t occur.MacCallum and Kashuv then talked back and forth about Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), who is frequently lambasted by the student gun grabbers.After standing up for Rubio, Kashuv returned to his central theme:I did not see a single sign [at the march] that said, “Screw the Sheriff” or “Screw the Broward County’s Sheriff Office.” I did not see a single sign. We need to represent and we need to make sure that the government is held accountable. And we fail, we have to make sure that they are held accountable. We cannot allow the government to continuously fail and not enforce what it supposed to do.Kashuv said we have to quit deflecting our anger and look at the “authoritative figures” who failed: “The FBI, and Sheriff Scott Israel, and the sheriff’s office, and the cowards of Broward, who did not do their job.

Mr. Cooper will prove hardly a match for this gal.This important interview comes after Stormy Daniels posed for pictures, apparently submitting to a lie detector test.It was unclear in the picture whether she really did hook up with an actual polygraph machine or if it was a black snake strangling a package of Easter peeps.The polygraph is an “instrument for recording several pulsations of the body at the same time.” Behold the polygraph versus the poly-receptacle.These swamp denizens, so desperate to deliver the kill-shot to Mr. Trump, insist they have dug up his Monica Lewinsky. My goodness, haven’t these people piled enough insult and injury upon Monica Lewinsky?That woman, Ms. Lewinsky, never posed nude. She is not a porn “star.” She never sought the spotlight, telling conflicting stories about a relationship with the president.She never offered to pay back $130,000 so that she could “tell her story.” (By the way, how many successful porn hits do you have to make in order to have so much money you are actually willing to PAY $130,000 to “tell your story”? Or, perhaps, is there something else going on here?)Anyway, Ms. Lewinsky was a 22-year-old White House intern when she was repeatedly and recklessly molested by the most powerful man on the planet — who also happened to be her boss.Also, then-President Bill Clinton performed his sick, predatory lechery on government time in his government office, using his government position to not only collect sexual favors but to subsequently cover them up and punish those seeking the truth.And of course, the media scandal surrounding Mr. Clinton’s Lewinsky lechery stemmed from the fact that America’s most powerful media organizations of the day were desperately trying to cover up the story. It wasn’t until internet news impresario Matt Drudge revealed the cover-up (as well as the original scandal) that the top was blown off the story.In these days of fake news, it is nearly impossible to discern who is lying and who is just being snookered. But one thing is for sure, NOBODY is trying to cover up for Stormy Daniels.• Charles Hurt can be reached at churt@washingtontimes.com; follow him on Twitter via @charleshurt.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

A father is supposed to be a protector, not a predator,” Harris County, Texas, Assistant District Attorney Stewanna Miskell said in a statement after the case. “Jurors saw the need to keep him out of our community.”Turley was nabbed in 2015 after attempting to arrange a sexual encounter between his little daughter and what he thought was a John. The potential client turned out to be an undercover police officer.Over the course of the 70-message round of communication, including claims by Turley that he would drug the girl before the sexual encounter and his demand for $1,000 per session with the child, police arrested the man and charged him with sex trafficking.The sting culminated when police arrived at the home, gave him the money, and then found the child to be under the influence of some unknown substance.The suspect was arrested at the home of the child’s mother. Police say that the mother was unaware of her ex-husband’s plot. She was not charged.Turley was ordered to serve two 30-year sentences consecutively but must serve a minimum of 45 years before being eligible for parole.Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Mark Amodei (R-NV) told local politics show Nevada Newsmakers Monday that the rumor on Capitol Hill is that Paul Ryan (R-WI) will resign as Speaker of the House in the next 30-60 days, to be replaced by now-Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).Both Ryan and Scalise quickly denied the rumor. “The speaker is not resigning,” Ashlee Strong, spokeswoman for the Speaker, told The Hill just as Amodei’s remarks began to spread like wildfire online.Meanwhile, a Scalise staffer told WDSU-New Orleans the Majority Whip was “proud to serve alongside Speaker Ryan, and fully supports him to remain speaker.”Later, Scalise add in a statement:Our whole leadership team is focused on working with President Trump to deliver more conservative wins for the country, and also ensuring that we keep the majority so we can continue implementing President Trump’s agenda that is getting our economy back on track.Amondei’s staff also appeared to walk back his remarks on Nevada Newsmakers. His Communications Director, Logan Ramsey, emphasized to CNN that his boss was only repeating a “rumor he had heard.”“His response to the question was made explicitly in the context of a rumor, nothing else,” Ramsey said.“The rumor mill is that Paul Ryan is getting ready to resign in the next 30 to 60 days and that Steve Scalise will be the new Speaker,” the Reno Gazette-Journal quotes Amodei’s original remarks.“If it, in fact, it is true, I know that Paul Ryan thinks he wants to play on the national stage in some capacity or another, so I don’t know what that means,” Amodei said, adding, “And my speculation is this: The White House and Paul Ryan would probably not be a great fit.”Ryan has come under heavy criticism from the “Trumpist” wing of the Republican Party he leads in the House, a fact Amodei acknowledged as he discussed the rumor.“Paul was a ‘Never Trumper’ for awhile and then they kind of made up,” Amodei said on Nevada Newsmakers. “Heck, when you talk about the Omnibus [spending] bill, Ryan was down at the White House earlier in the week and I assumed (they were) discussing why there wasn’t more [border] Wall money in there, or something like that.”Ryan has had to deny rumors of his resignation before, including back in December when CNN claimed sources close to him had indicated he would not run again.Scalise, on the other hand, had not featured prominently in speculation about successors for the speakership before Amodei’s candid remarks. The solidly conservative five-term congressman rocketed to national prominence after he was repeatedly shot by a leftist gunman while practicing for the congressional charity baseball game with other Republicans last June.The gunman, James Hodgkinson, “liked” supremely well-funded left-wing group the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) on social media. The SPLC had made several “intelligence report” posts about Scalise implying he was a racist extremist and an associate of David Duke before Hodgkinson “liked” their site.The revelation was eerily familiar to the discovery that Family Research Council-shooter Floyd Lee Corkins II used the SPLC’s “hate lists” before embarking on his would-be rampage. These lists typically include conservative politicians, pro-American immigration think-tanks, and traditional Christian non-profits alongside hundreds of tiny, questionably existent Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups, describing all as “extremists” and “hate groups.”Scalise has served as majority whip, arguably the number three position in the House Republican leadership, since 2014.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

All the murders by the gang occurred within a 12-month span, with the latest murder happening less than a week ago, Lombardo confirmed.“The suspects involved in these crimes are extremely violent and killed their victims over as little as identifying with another gang or participating in street level narcotic sales,” Lombardo said. “All the victims were either shot or stabbed numerous times.”Lombardo said his sheriff’s department is “confident” that the MS-13 gang members involved in the murders have been located and arrested.Another official said one victim that had been shot and stabbed multiple times was a former MS-13 gang member. Weeks later, police discovered another murder victim of the gang who had been shot and stabbed. He too was a current or former MS-13 gang member.The other victims, according to police, were involved with Mexican gangs.In late 2017, Breitbart News reported how about one-third of the 215 MS-13 gang members arrested that month across the U.S. were unaccompanied minors who had illegally crossed into the country and were later resettled in the country.United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Lee Francis Cissna warned President Trump’s administration last month that the current immigration system prevents the agency from deporting foreign-born MS-13 gang members.“…There are no grounds in the law right now that permit us to deport a gang member merely because he’s a gang member,” Cissna said. “We have to wait until they’ve actually killed somebody or harmed an American.  Then we have a reason to deport them; then we can get them. Or if they’re here unlawfully, okay. But if they’re here lawfully, and they’re a gang member, there’s no ground of removal, really.”John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/03/26/afghan-doctors-kill-soldiers-botched-transfusions-wrong-blood-type/","Inaccurate collecting, screening, and recording of blood samples by the Afghan National Army (ANA) resulted in the death of an unknown number of soldiers who received the wrong type of blood when injured in combat, revealed a watchdog agency.The agency added that potential exposure to infectious diseases could affect U.S. trainers and advisers.In a recently published audit, the U.S. Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), a watchdog agency, found:DOD officials we spoke with, the ANA does not have an official system of record that tracks the medical data of new recruits. As a result, the Afghan government does not know which soldiers have been blood-typed or screened for infectious diseases. This information is critically important because successful blood transfusions for wounded soldiers require that donated blood be the appropriate type and free from infectious diseases. Lastly, we found that the ANA’s overall medical record keeping is unreliable and often inaccurate.…An advisor assisting ANA personnel at ANAREC [Afghan National Army Recruiting Command] told us that he was aware that ANA soldiers have been killed from receiving the wrong type of blood when injured in combat. However, neither he nor CSTC-A [U.S.-NATO’s Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan] was able to provide the number of soldiers killed as a result of receiving the wrong type of blood.U.S.-NATO’s CSTC-A is charged with training, advising, and assisting the Afghan soldiers in military medical care.Officials from the U.S. transition command concurred with SIGAR’s revelations and vowed to rectify the severe shortcomings, but the Afghan Ministry of Defense reportedly rejected the findings.SIGAR cautions that a lack of a complete and accurate data on blood types and unreliable screening for infectious diseases “put both soldiers and military readiness at risk.”Afghan army officers have failed to screen the blood of 15,400 recruits (about 10 percent of the estimated 171,510 active duty soldiers ), allowing thousands of unscreened service members to mingle with other soldiers potentially exposing many of them, including their American advisors, to infectious diseases, SIGAR suggests.In total, 77,178 (45 percent) of the 171,510 active Afghan do not have their blood type recorded in the computerized database Afghan Human Resource Information System (AHRIMS), rendering the program unreliable.Despite the billions of dollars the U.S. has spent on developing the ANA, a component of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), problems, such as inaccurate medical records persist.Of the total $122 billion the United States has spent on nation-building in Afghanistan since the war started in 2001, the United States has devoted an estimated $75 billion (60 percent) to developing the ANDSF, which also includes police units.The Afghan army claims it lacks enough supplies and equipment to collect and record the blood type of the recruits.The U.S.-NATO transition command already provides hundreds of millions of dollars for procuring medical equipment and supplies for testing blood. In 2017 alone, the U.S.-NATO CSTC-A mission awarded $165 million to procure medical supplies.Corruption is rampant at all levels of the Afghan government.According to SIGAR, Kabul is squandering billions of the nearly $1 trillion in American taxpayer dollars spent on the war since it started on October 7, 2001.Instead of procuring the equipment, the officers referred the soldiers to “unaffiliated” or unvetted local physicians to get tested and pay for the cost out of their pocket without reimbursement, which is one of the reasons that prompted SIGAR to conduct the audit.The Afghan army has been sending their recruits to unreliable local doctors for their blood tests since January 2017.SIGAR learned from a source that the doctors used by the Afghan National Army were taking the money without conducting tests or accurately recording the results.John Sopko, the head of SIGAR, wrote:During the course of our review, we received additional information from an [Afghan army] advisor, confirming initial concerns, that physicians may be stamping medical forms without actually collecting and testing blood samples, or without conducting any medical examinationsSIGAR suspects that the even the computerized database records are useless, noting that widespread illiteracy, lack of technical skills related to using computer systems, internet access, and no institutional knowledge among ANA personnel result in inaccurate medical data being entered in the computerized database, rendering the program unreliable.Afghan Army recruits are expected to receive several blood tests intended to identify blood type and infectious disease status, which typically includes screening for hepatitis B and C, venereal diseases, and HIV.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

These benefits, plus the Social Security payouts, would amount to a $2 trillion cost to American taxpayers over the course of a lifetime, Kopits estimates.“…It will be an expensive proposition,” Kopits says of the amnesty in his report.Amnesty, although beneficial to illegal aliens, comes at the expense of American citizens. For the nearly 800,000 to 3.5 million illegal aliens enrolled and eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, granting an amnesty would cost taxpayers at least $26 billion.Additionally, about one in five DACA illegal aliens, after an amnesty, would end up on food stamps, while at least one in seven would go on Medicaid, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated.Any plan to give amnesty to DACA illegal aliens that does not also include provisions to halve legal immigration levels — the U.S. admits more than one million legal immigrants a year at the expense of America’s working and middle class — would give amnestied illegal aliens the opportunity to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country.Nonetheless, the taxpayer cost of an amnesty has not stopped the billionaire GOP donors, the Koch brothers, from pushing Republican lawmakers to get behind a plan to give amnesty to millions of illegal aliens who are eligible for DACA.Already, illegal immigration costs American taxpayers about $116 billion every year, Breitbart News reported, or about $8,075 per taxpayer.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

There was no story of attacking her or abusing her. She wanted to have sex with him. Since when is that a crime? If you had to put everybody in jail because they had sex, the whole country would be in jail.But the media ignored as Clinton was an out and out rapist. Remember Juanita Broaddrick? First he punches her and beats her up, and while she is bleeding he tells he to go put ice on it. More of the girls with Clinton ended up in hospitals than with sex. He wasn’t even interested in sex. He didn’t want to waste his time having sex. He punched them around. At least with Trump, every one of them can still see straight and they aren’t bleeding.Broaddrick told NBC’s Dateline in 1999 that she resisted when Clinton suddenly kissed her in a hotel room in 1978, leading to the bloody lip:Then he tries to kiss me again. And the second time he tries to kiss me he starts biting my lip. … He starts to, um, bite on my top lip and I tried to pull away from him. And then he forces me down on the bed. And I just was very frightened, and I tried to get away from him and I told him “No,” that I didn’t want this to happen but he wouldn’t listen to me. … It was a real panicky, panicky situation. I was even to the point where I was getting very noisy, you know, yelling to “Please stop.” And that’s when he pressed down on my right shoulder and he would bite my lip. … When everything was over with, he got up and straightened himself, and I was crying at the moment and he walks to the door, and calmly puts on his sunglasses. And before he goes out the door he says, “You better get some ice on that.” And he turned and went out the door.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Broaddrick recounted during a Breitbart News video interview what she described as the life-changing experience of being raped by Clinton. Trembling, Broaddrick explained that she is still afraid of Clinton.﻿In a previous Breitbart News interview, Broaddrick said she was raped not once but twice by Clinton during the same infamous encounter in 1978.Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones both accused Clinton of sexual assault, with Willey saying that she suffered acts of intimidation in what she has described as a campaign to silence her.In 2016, Leslie Millwee, a former local television news reporter from Arkansas, told this reporter in an exclusive interview that she was sexually assaulted by Clinton on three separate occasions in 1980.Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

For the 2020 Census, Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ Department of Justice (DOJ) has requested Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to add the citizenship question to the full survey.Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, likewise, has urged Ross to add the citizenship question to the Census in order to know “the exact number of citizens in our states.”The open borders lobby and Washington, D.C. establishment figures, though, have claimed that asking residents if they are citizens on the Census will drastically reduce Census participation.Camarota’s research finds no proof backing up this claim.For example, Camarota found no significant increase in the number of respondents who refused to participate in the 2016 American Community Survey (ACS), the Census Bureau’s largest survey.Between 2015 and 2016, ACS participation rates dropped by only 0.1 percentage points. Camarota says the drop is on par with past years, noting that respondents’ refusal to participate in the survey has been increasing since 2006.Center for Immigration StudiesMore specifically, when Camarota looked at how many respondents had left the citizenship blank or gave nonsensical responses, he found that the rate did not increase between 2015 to 2016, once again showing no “Trump Effect.”Also, the open borders lobby’s claim that asking the citizenship question will scare off foreign-born, noncitizen Census respondents is not backed up by any data from previous years.Instead, Camarota’s study found that on the Census Bureau’s monthly Current Population Survey, between January 2014 and January 2018, there has been no drop in the foreign-born population’s participation in the survey.Center for Immigration StudiesNotwithstanding,  left-wing politicians across the U.S., the former Census Bureau director under former President Obama, the mainstream media, and the open borders lobby have been relentless in claiming that to ask residents if they are American citizens on the 2020 Census will be a “tremendous risk.”Kobach says the citizenship question is necessary to ensure that there is “fairness” in the country’s elections.“The most important of which is we use the census to decide how to portion congressional districts and that in turn effects electoral votes as well,” Kobach told Breitbart News. “And so, we have now districts, especially in states like California — other states with a large number of illegal aliens — where instead of having 710,000 citizens, which is the average, approximate average of the congressional district size — instead of having that number of citizens in a district, you may have half of that number as citizens and half of that number as illegal aliens, which means that the citizens in that district have twice as much electoral power as you and I do. It only takes 40[,000] or 50,000 votes to win a congressional election where it takes 100[,000] or 120,000 votes to win a congressional election in the rest of the country.”“You know the notion that, say you’re from England and you’re taking a two-week long trip, family vacation, through the United States, no one would seriously say that you should be counted in the United States census,” Kobach continued. “But that’s where we are right now. We’re counting illegal aliens and we’re counting people here on temporary visits. It’s nonsense. And if we want to have fairness in our census and fairness in the way our congressional districts are portioned, we at least need to have the information.”John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Carter had, the Washington Post later noted, acted as “a private citizen … without authorization or authority.”Carter was not, however, prosecuted under the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from conducting diplomacy on behalf of the United States, and which was used to spy on former Trump administration National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.Later, Carter’s interventions were blamed for helping to launch a Palestinian terror war against Israel. As Alan Dershowitz argues  in The Case Against Israel’s Enemies: Exposing Jimmy Carter and Others Who Stand in the Way of Peace, during peace talks at Camp David in 2000, Carter may have advised then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat “to reject Israeli offers and walk away from the table.” (41) Arafat launched the second intifada soon thereafter.Carter told USA Today that he was worried that Trump was appointing people who supported his administration’s policies.“I am concerned as a matter of fact about his deliberate moves to get into the key positions of government just people who agree with him,” he said.Joel B.

Louie Gohmert, who want to see Trump’s immigration agenda put into high gear, now admit that with the signing of the omnibus, the GOP could be in trouble for the midterms.“I’m afraid this could end up costing us the majority –in which case you will have total new leadership in the House,” Gohmert said. “I don’t know if the Senate likes to hang on to their bad leadership no matter what happens; but, it would probably mean new leadership there.”Yet, Trump’s own Budget Director Mick Mulvaney praised the omnibus, saying, “this is a really, really good immigration package” before the president decided he was going to sign the bill.Mulvaney on omnibus, in case there is still any suspense: “Let's cut to the chase. Is the president going to sign the bill?

Some say she pushed Trump to sign the plan, while others said she wanted the president to veto the plan.Sources close to Breitbart News did not confirm Nielsen’s position on the omnibus spending bill.In the end, it was Defense Secretary James Mattis who pushed Trump to throw out his immigration agenda for the second year in a row, ultimately prioritizing bulks of military spending instead of securing the southern border and reducing illegal and legal immigration levels, where the U.S. continues to admit more than 1.5 million foreign nationals every year.For House Speaker Paul Ryan, the omnibus signing means another year that his brand of Republicanism is able to get by without having to bend to Republican voters’ desires on immigration, wherein reducing immigration is more important than his tax cut plan and even destroying the Islamic State.At the southern border, the illegal immigration problem has persisted under Trump.The latest numbers show that illegal immigration has increased nearly three percent from 25,978 to 26,666 illegal aliens crossing the border in February. The border-crossings are on par with illegal immigration levels under former President Obama.Without the full funding of a border wall for this year, Princeton Policy Adviser President Steven Kopits has warned that illegal immigration in 2018 could increase by 70 percent, making Trump’s second year in office the second highest year for illegal immigration on the southern border since 2010.Meanwhile, Americans’ wages — which were on the rise months ago — have slowed down as illegal immigration continues as usual and ICE is not given any more manpower than they had a year ago to deport illegal aliens living in the interior of the country.Still, the red flags for Republican lawmakers in the midterm elections have left the party’s establishment unphased, at least publicly.Ryan has continued pushing his tax cuts as the pinnacle argument for Republican voters to turn out for the GOP in the midterms.Enjoyed discussing the tax cuts bill, natural rights, and the future of the conservative movement with @BenShapiro this week. https://t.co/jLc9sKpj5G— Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) March 23, 2018GOP voters, though, say tax cuts are their least important issue in the midterm elections. The most important issue? Immigration and the economy.Likewise, the much-needed swing voters in the midterm elections also say taxes are their least important issue, while immigration polls as their third most important issue, just after healthcare and the economy.Last year, the Republican establishment and beltway White House staffers convinced the Trump administration to prioritize tax cuts as the leading legislative issue of the year.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/26/microsoft-decides-search-data-offensive-language-ban/","Starting May 1, Microsoft will begin enforcing a ban on “offensive language.” To do so, they have determined that they have the right to mine private user data to “investigate.”A new Microsoft Terms of Service agreement will soon take effect across their broad spectrum of products and services, granting them license to ban accounts on Xbox Live, Skype, and more. Cursing can trigger that ban, and so can any sexually suggestive material. If Cortana so much as hears you utter an impolite word, you are eligible to have your accounts — and their respective digital balances — terminated.Civil rights activist and law student Jonathan Corbett was the first to smell something rotten. On his “Professional Troublemaker” blog, Corbett details his search through the updated TOS and the disturbing realization:So wait a sec: I can’t use Skype to have an adult video call with my girlfriend?  I can’t use OneDrive to back up a document that says “fuck” in it?  If I call someone a mean name in Xbox Live, not only will they cancel my account, but also confiscate any funds I’ve deposited in my account?  (And are we no longer allowed to shoot people in Call of Duty?  Animated violence doesn’t really get any more “graphic” than this Microsoft-approved video game offers.)And while it seems clear that Microsoft probably will not bother to excise every customer who has ever said a dirty word in front of their invasive A.I. assistant, the problem is how vague their definition of what constitutes a punishable offense actually is. When the only qualifier is “offensive,” and the consequences are a complete invasion of privacy and the restriction of everything from saving text documents to sending e-mail, it seems just a tad open-ended.It is not difficult to surmise Microsoft’s reasoning behind the change. This new regulation is broadly unenforceable. Even Microsoft admits that it “cannot monitor the entire Services and make no attempt to do so.” What it does provide, however, is a broad rug underneath which to sweep virtually any account it deems “problematic.” Furthermore, the only criteria for searching your data — or even listening to your Skype calls — is that an employee has decided to “investigate.”Obviously, the changes will also help protect the company from any complications with the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), which was combined with the Stop Enabling Sex-Trafficking Act (SESTA). Those bills, despite all manner of good intention, “[raise] a serious constitutional concern” according to the Department of Justice. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the passing of the bill “a dark day for the open internet,” asserting that “lawmakers failed to separate their good intentions from bad law.”And Microsoft is not the only company reacting. Craigslist has deleted their “personals” sections, and Reddit has banned numerous subreddits in response to the new legislation. Even Democratic Senator Ron Wyden loudly criticized the decision, saying:This bill will only prop up the entrenched players who are rapidly losing the public’s trust. The failure to understand the technological side effects of this bill — specifically that it will become harder to expose sex-traffickers, while hamstringing innovation — will be something that this congress will regret.Now Microsoft has leveraged that same decision to take universal liberties with any customer who has or will ever use their services. The only solution is to somehow extricate yourself from their network of software — already a virtual impossibility if you’re reading this article — or watch your mouth.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/26/gop-rep-georgia-immigration-enforcement-like-nazi-germany/","The state of Georgia will be like Nazi Germany if it requires enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws, says a business-first Republican in the state legislature.The claim was made by GOP Rep. Heath Clark as he announced his subcommittee was gutting a pro-American immigration reform bill which is backed by Lt. Governor Casey Cagle in the GOP gubernatorial primaries.“This isn’t Nazi Germany — we are not asking people to carry their papers around on them at all times,” said Clark, the vice chairman of the House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee.The original Cagle-backed bill — Senate Bill 452 — says police shall notify local, state and federal officials when they arrest an illegal immigrant.But Clark and his allies took out the word “shall” and inserted “may” at the behest of business lobbies. That change allows local business groups and ethnic lobbies to pressure police chiefs to minimize the reporting and deportation of the many illegal-immigrant workers in Georgia who hold down Americans’ wages.Clark explained March 20:In section one we did change a ‘shall’ back to a ‘may.’ There were some concerns within the business community with international companies. A CEO or somebody might be here with a foreign driver’s license and if they were pulled over for, for some reason, and if they didn’t have their visa on them. You know most people don’t carry that around on them on a permanent basis because they don’t want to lose it because it’s a pain to get another one. We want to allow for discretion, for the police officer to maintain some discretion there … This isn’t Nazi Germany – we’re not asking people to carry their papers around on them at all times.Federal law does require foreigners to carry their visas. “Section 264(e) of the INA says:e) Every alien, eighteen years of age and over, shall at all times carry with him and have in his personal possession any certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to him pursuant to subsection (d).“I think he has a very common [soft-on-eforcement] attitude in the General Assembly, but he has the arrogance to not hide it,” said D. A. King, founder of the Dustin Inman Society, a pro-enforcement advocacy group. “This is clearly the open-air voice of the illegal alien lobby and the business lobby.”Clark is an “anti-enforcement liberal masquerading as a Republican conservative,” King told Breitbart News. Rep. Clark also changed the bill to remove a requirement that courts tell federal officials when they have convicted an illegal of any crime in the state. Clark’s amended version now says judges shall only report felony crimes. That change will reduce the deportation of wage-lowering illegals who commit non-felony crimes, such as drunk-driving.Clark did not respond to Britbart News. Clark first made the changes in a back-room subcommittee meeting but announced them in a televised meeting of the full committee. He announced the changes only a few days before the legislature finishes its annual session on Thursday.“This is what happens every year …  most of this will not be done in public,” King said, adding that the room was:  packed with the same people who scream in American streets against immigration enforcement …For a sense of the room, the man sitting in front of me and next to communist Adelina Nicholls , leader of the anti-borders ‘Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights’ , was wearing a GLAHR t-shirt that read ‘DEFY, DEFEND, EXPAND.’However, Clark’s changes can be rejected by the Senate — which passed the”shall” version of the bill — and also can be reversed by the House’s GOP leadership if they feel public pressure, King said. In the GOP gubernatorial primary, “I’m grateful that all of the gubernatorial candidates are concerned about illegal immigration in our state [because] we have more illegal aliens than Arizona,” King told Breitbart. However, he cautioned:I am very alarmed that they all seem to be unwilling to mention the [role of] illegal employment which creates most of the illegal immigration. We have an E-Verify law [barring employment of illegals] that needs a lot of work. That is where their campaigns should be focused.The state’s Hispanic population is now more than 850,000, up from roughly 30,000 in 1992. Many of the newcomers work in low-wage, low-tech blue-collar jobs, so helping company owners cuts costs and avoid investment in labor-saving machinery.The mostly poor immigrant population is also shifting the state towards the Democratic Party while helping to lower wages state-wide and also drive up housing prices for young Americans.     MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

The email was reportedly sent to department staff by acting head of FSA James Manning, a longstanding education department employee who, as Inside Higher Ed observed, goes as far back as the Carter administration.In January, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos announced that Manning would take on the top post at FSA.Appel first joined the department in 2011 and served as deputy undersecretary of education during the Obama administration. He will now serve as FSA’s director of policy liaison and implementation in the Trump administration’s education department.From 2007 to 2011, Appel worked for Rep. George Miller (D-CA) as a senior policy advisor for the U.S. House of Representative’s Committee on Education and Labor, where, according to the U.S. Education Department, he “led numerous student aid and higher education policy efforts that guided legislation for the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act, the 2008 Higher Education Act reauthorization, the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.”Also in January, the federal education department announced that Kathleen Smith would become deputy chief operating officer of FSA. Smith served as chief of staff at the department’s Office of Postsecondary Education (OPE) during the Obama era from 2009-2013.According to a department press release, Smith is “responsible for managing, under the direction of the Chief Operating Officer, the daily operations of Federal Student Aid (FSA), its 1300 employees, and its $1.4 trillion student loan portfolio.”Marianna O’Brien will also be serving as FSA’s chief of staff, Politico reports. From 2013 to 2015, O’Brien served as executive director of the College Board, which is led by David Coleman, the so-called “architect” of the Common Core State Standards. The College Board also realigned the SAT exam to Common Core, and recently revised the Advanced Placement U.S. History and Advanced Placement European History frameworks.Keith Wilson will move from his post of chief information officer at FSA to become a senior adviser in business operations. Wilson formerly served as director of education services in the Obama-era Veterans Administration under Secretary Eric Shinseki.The reshuffling of employees is part of other “organizational changes” the education department says it is making.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/business/economy/trump-china-economy.html","Since the days of the Nixon administration nearly 50 years ago, American policy has aimed to steer China out of its isolation to prosper in the global market economy. There needn’t be conflict between the established superpower and the emerging giant, the best strategic minds argued. As it grew rich, they reasoned, China could be integrated peacefully into the institutional framework built by the Western powers from the rubble of World War II.The proposition fit with the “liberal peace” view of foreign relations: that nations engaged in intense economic intercourse would find it too costly to go to war. American businesses that flocked to China to tap its cheap labor and huge consumer market after its entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001 enthusiastically agreed with the approach.That strategy, it appears, is over.President Trump’s announcement last week that the United States would impose a battery of tariffs against as much as $60 billion worth of Chinese goods while restricting Chinese investments in American technology companies has set policy onto a different, more belligerent path. China is now, in the president’s words, an “economic enemy.”Interestingly, not all scholars have opposed the change of tone. Many foreign policy experts agree that China is not playing by the rules. American businesses, which typically endorsed forbearance to protect their market access to China, have grown frustrated at its appropriation of their intellectual property.John Mearsheimer, a foreign policy expert at the University of Chicago, doesn’t buy the idea of liberal peace. In “The Tragedy of Great Power Politics,” published in 2001, he wrote, “A wealthy China would not be a status quo power but an aggressive state determined to achieve regional hegemony.”And yet Mr. Trump’s hard-line approach to China seems destined to fail. Taking a stand against China’s abusive behaviors is not necessarily wrong. The problem with the president’s game plan is that it is inconsistent with all the other diplomatic initiatives he has taken so far. The tangle of stabs and swipes at allies and rivals alike, in the service of ill-conceived goals like closing a trade deficit, serves China more than it does the United States.“Trump has been a godsend for China,” noted Eswar Prasad, an expert on trade at Cornell University who once headed the China division at the International Monetary Fund. “China has manipulated the rules, but Trump’s response is counterproductive.”China is clearly chafing at the rules put together by the West. It openly disagrees with the postwar apportionment of the South China Sea. It is more than willing to flout the World Trade Organization’s intellectual property rules to build its domestic technological expertise.Several Chinese initiatives — its One Belt, One Road effort to build infrastructure to connect to Central Asia, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership it hopes to negotiate with its Asian neighbors, and its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank — are aimed at building an institutional framework to rival the trade agreements and multinational financial institutions supported by the West.As a counterweight, Washington could strengthen the global institutions that support its own view of fair play, like the World Trade Organization, which the United States took such trouble to build. It could build new ones, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, open to China as long as it agreed to abide by the rules. It could nail down its vast web of alliances in Asia and around the world — to ensure it wouldn’t confront China alone.That is not, however, what Mr. Trump is doing. Ditching the Trans-Pacific Partnership, imposing new tariffs on Japanese steel and hinting that the United States may even walk away from the W.T.O. all serve China’s goal of undermining the arrangements and institutions that stand in its way. “Trump is a blessing for them,” Mr. Prasad argued. “All they were trying to do, Trump is ramping up a couple of levels.”Where might Mr. Trump lead relations between the two biggest economies on earth?The outcome doesn’t have to be horrible. Mr. Trump’s willingness to slap real punitive tariffs on Chinese goods, regardless of the collateral damage they may cause on the American economy, gives Washington some leverage in its face-off with Beijing. It could be deployed productively.A decade ago, American pressure gave the Chinese government political space to let its currency appreciate and cool its runaway export growth. Today, American pressure could help Beijing make an argument to curb China’s excess capacity in steel and aluminum.Washington’s threats could also help Chinese leaders build a legal system to protect intellectual property, a necessary step if China is to become a more innovative economy that develops its own technologies. Mr. Trump could even get China to offer more market access for agricultural products and other valuable American exports.While Professor Mearsheimer argues that the United States should aim to contain China by preventing it from expanding its influence or conquering territory in Asia and by building alliances to hem in Chinese power, Robert J. Art, a professor of international relations at Brandeis University, argues that the United States and China can make a deal.China and the United States would both benefit from stability in the Taiwan Strait and a peaceful reunification of Taiwan and China, Professor Art said. Both would prefer a denuclearized Korean Peninsula as well as a peaceful resolution of China’s maritime disputes. Both would prefer that Japan not acquire nuclear weapons. Notably, both would prefer maintaining an open economic order.Mr. Trump seems uninterested in either path. Indeed, the uncertainty hanging over America’s relations with China is really a question about what the president ultimately wants. Is the objective to balance bilateral trade? Does he hope to slow China’s growth, to prevent it from becoming a formidable rival? Both are probably unachievable.Trade deficits cannot be negotiated away. The United States will run a deficit as long as it depends on foreign money to close the gap between what it saves and what it spends. Slowing China’s growth unilaterally is also pretty much impossible. There are too many countries that have little sympathy for Mr. Trump’s objectives and are willing to trade with Asia’s biggest economy. Washington might slow China’s technological progress but seems unlikely to stop it.The worry among economists and foreign policy experts alike is that Mr. Trump’s stand on China is determined by domestic politics alone. The president doesn’t know what he wants out of a relationship with China, nor what the United States could feasibly achieve. He has figured out what his voters would like. That, apparently, is enough.American workers are fed up with China. They believe the Asian giant’s entrance into the world economy cost them their jobs and undercut their wages. Up to a point, they are right. Their itch to punish it, however, is misguided. And allowing their irritation to shape American policy toward China is wrong.The view that China would peacefully rise within the West’s institutional framework may have proved hopelessly naïve. Reorienting Washington’s China policy to fit the frustration of workers in Michigan could prove disastrous.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/us/politics/trump-lawyers-digenova.html","As President Trump heads into one of the most critical phases of the special counsel’s investigation, his personal legal team has shrunk to essentially just one member, and he is struggling to find any top lawyers willing to represent him.Working for a president is usually seen as a dream job. But leading lawyers in Washington and New York have repeatedly spurned overtures to take over the defense of Mr. Trump, a mercurial client who often ignores his advisers’ guidance. In some cases, lawyers’ firms have blocked any talks, fearing a backlash that would hurt business.The president lost two lawyers in just the past four days, including one who had been on board for less than a week.Joseph diGenova, a longtime Washington lawyer who has pushed theories on Fox News that the F.B.I. made up evidence against Mr. Trump, left the team on Sunday. He had been hired last Monday, three days before the head of the president’s personal legal team, John Dowd, quit after determining that the president was not listening to his advice. Mr. Trump had also considered hiring Mr. diGenova’s wife, Victoria Toensing, but she will also not join the team.That leaves the president with just one personal lawyer who is working full time on the special counsel’s investigation as Mr. Trump is facing one of the most significant decisions related to it: whether to sit for an interview.That lawyer, Jay Sekulow, is a conservative commentator who made his name on religious freedom cases. Mr. Sekulow is in talks with other lawyers about joining the team, although it is not clear how far those discussions have progressed.Hours before the announcement of Mr. diGenova’s departure, which Mr. Sekulow said was related to a conflict of interest, the president took to Twitter to reject any suggestion that lawyers do not want to work for him.“Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case … don’t believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on,” he wrote. “Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted.”Adding new lawyers, he said, would be costly because they would take months “to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more).”“I am very happy with my existing team,” he added.This month, the president met with the veteran lawyer Emmet Flood about the possibility of joining the legal team. But Mr. Trump was put off by the fact that Mr. Flood, a Republican, had represented Bill Clinton during his impeachment process, and Mr. Flood has made clear that he will not represent the president if Marc E. Kasowitz, his brash longtime personal lawyer, has any role in the effort.Mr. Trump also tried to recruit Theodore B. Olson, a well-known Republican lawyer, but Mr. Olson has said he would not be representing the president.The first phase of legal work for Mr. Trump in the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, was led by a White House lawyer, Ty Cobb. That work, which in part involved the production of documents and the arrangement of interviews with White House officials, has been largely completed.The second phase, which is now focused on the question of a presidential interview with Mr. Mueller, had been led by Mr. Dowd. One reason Mr. Dowd quit was that, against his advice, Mr. Trump was insistent that he wanted to answer questions under oath from Mr. Mueller, believing that it would help clear him.Mr. Dowd had concluded that there was no upside and that the president, who often does not tell the truth, could increase his legal exposure if his answers were not accurate.Roger Cossack, a seasoned legal analyst, said the key to successfully defending a high-profile client under immense scrutiny was to have a cohesive legal team with a consistent strategy.“In these types of cases, you need highly competent lawyers and a client who will listen and follow their advice,” Mr. Cossack said. “If you don’t have both, you have what we’re seeing here: chaos and disaster.”“You have a client who clearly thinks he has a better idea of how things should work than the lawyers who, from time to time, have told him things he doesn’t want to hear,” he added. “He is looking for the guy who can say, ‘I know how to handle Mueller, I know you think he is bad, and we’ll take care of it.’ Problem is you can’t find that lawyer because no one will be able to do that.”People close to the president say the upheaval in the legal team was inevitable. When Mr. Kasowitz took the lead after Mr. Mueller was appointed in May, he wanted to follow a model used by Mr. Clinton, with a separate team of lawyers and communications professionals handling issues related to the inquiry, so that the White House staff could keep its distance.But Mr. Trump, who trusts few people and considers himself his best lawyer, spokesman and strategist, never wanted that type of system. As a result, his legal and public relations strategies have been out of sync, with the president at times publicly contradicting his lawyers, and the White House often finding itself flat-footed in the face of new disclosures about the Russia investigation.The president’s decision has also exposed many of his aides, leaving them deeply enmeshed in an inquiry that is likely to cost them tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees.But while Mr. Trump has struggled to find lawyers, his family and his close associates are being represented by some of the country’s top legal talent.His son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has hired Abbe Lowell, a longtime Washington lawyer who recently got the Justice Department to drop corruption charges against Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, after a lengthy court fight.Three prominent current and former White House officials — the former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon; the former chief of staff, Reince Priebus; and the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn — are being represented by William A. Burck, who turned down the chance to represent the president. Mr. Burck, a former federal prosecutor, represented FIFA in its legal problems in the United States and has worked for high-profile witnesses in federal investigations, including Maureen McDonnell, the wife of a former Virginia governor.The turmoil in Mr. Trump’s legal team started within weeks of the appointment of Mr. Mueller. Mr. Kasowitz pushed for an adversarial approach to the special counsel, which the president was poised to follow. But Mr. Kasowitz clashed with Mr. Kushner, and he was soon pushed aside after a series of missteps and embarrassing incidents.The president then hired Mr. Cobb, a veteran Washington lawyer, to lead efforts within the White House, as well as Mr. Dowd, who was put in charge of his personal legal team. They advocated a strategy of cooperation, telling the president that the sooner he gave Mr. Mueller’s office what it wanted, the sooner his name would be cleared.While Mr. Cobb had told the president that the investigation would be over by now, it seems to be accelerating. Mr. Mueller is still looking into a wide range of matters related to Mr. Trump’s corporate activities, his 2016 campaign, his associates and his time in office.Mr. Trump, hoping to bolster his team, met with Mr. diGenova and Ms. Toensing in recent days but, according to two people told of details about the meeting, did not believe he had personal chemistry with them.There were also significant conflict-of-interest issues, but Mr. Trump could have waived them if he wanted. Ms. Toensing is representing Mark Corallo, who was the spokesman for Mr. Trump’s legal team in 2017 before they parted ways. Mr. Corallo has told investigators that he was concerned that a close aide to Mr. Trump, Hope Hicks, may have been planning to obstruct justice during the drafting of a statement about a meeting between a Russian lawyer and Donald Trump Jr. during the campaign.Ms. Hicks’s lawyer has strongly denied that suggestion, and White House aides said Mr. Corallo’s assertion had come up in discussions with the president as he weighed whether to go ahead with Mr. diGenova and Ms. Toensing.Mr. diGenova had been expected to serve as an outspoken voice for the president as Mr. Trump has increased his attacks on Mr. Mueller. Mr. diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of F.B.I. agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way to keep Mr. Trump from becoming president, a theory with little supporting evidence.“There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn’t win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime,” he had told Fox News in January.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/597279176/nra-says-it-receives-foreign-funds-but-none-goes-to-election-work","The National Rifle Association acknowledged that it accepts foreign donations but says it does not use them for election work — even as federal investigators look into the role the NRA might have played in Russia's attack on the 2016 election.Pressure on the organization has also been increased by a McClatchy report which suggested that the FBI had been investigating whether a top Russian banker with Kremlin ties illegally funneled money to the NRA to aid President Trump's campaign for president. The Federal Election Commission has also opened a preliminary investigation into this question. The NRA is not required to be transparent about how money moves between its various political entities, and this leaves questions unanswered about how these foreign funds were ultimately spent.In the context of ongoing investigations, Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, wrote to the National Rifle Association earlier this month asking, ""Can you categorically state that your organizations have never, wittingly or unwittingly, received any contributions from individuals or entities acting as conduits for foreign entities or interests?""The NRA said that in fact they do receive foreign money, but not for election purposes.""While we do receive some contributions from foreign individuals and entities, those contributions are made directly to the NRA for lawful purposes,"" NRA's General Counsel John C. Frazer wrote to Wyden in a letter obtained by NPR. ""Our review of our records has found no foreign donations in connection with a United States election, either directly or through a conduit.""During 2015-2016, Frazer continued, the NRA received money from companies based in the U.S. which may be owned or managed by foreign nationals. ""However, none of those entities or individuals is connected with Russia, and none of their contributions were made in connection with U.S. elections,"" Frazer added.The NRA's response was not sufficient for Wyden. In a letter dated March 27, the senator demanded that the organization provide a detailed accounting of how foreign funds were used over the past three years, whether they were targeted at particular American audiences, and what its measured impact was. Wyden also demanded to know whether any Russian nationals or foreign individuals had been members of the NRA's donor programs, and whether the NRA received any money from sanctioned individuals.While the NRA claims it does not receive foreign money for election purposes, the movement of its money between accounts could make it difficult, if not impossible, to track how the money is spent since it is not isolated or sequestered.The NRA has a variety of accounts, and the NRA Political Victory Fund is their official political action committee and must report all of its spending to the Federal Election Commission. It also has other accounts that require less transparency, and do not report spending to the FEC — and in those funds, the NRA told Wyden, they ""receive funds from foreign persons only for purposes not connected to elections, as permitted by federal law."" However, the NRA acknowledges that money moves between those accounts: ""transfers between accounts are made as permitted by law,"" the NRA's general counsel wrote.The NRA did not immediately respond to a request from NPR to disclose the total sum of its donations from foreign sources. The NRA has been the subject of criticism for its opposition to gun control measures — criticism that has intensified in the wake of shootings at a high school in Parkland, Fla., last month. The controversy around the NRA and alleged ties to Russia center around one man: Kremlin-linked Russian politician Alexander Torshin. Starting in 2011 Torshin began cultivating ties with the National Rifle Association, establishing relationships with NRA officials, most especially former NRA President David Keene. Torshin's relationship with the NRA opened the door to his becoming an election observer in during the 2012 U.S. presidential election, at least five years of attendance at NRA conventions, and he even claimed to know Donald Trump through the organization.""I know D. Trump (through NRA),"" Torshin once wrote on Twitter. ""A decent person.""The House Intelligence Committee investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, led by Republicans, reported that ""Donald Trump Jr. briefly met with a Russian government official at the 2016 National Rifle Association annual meeting,"" but that the committee found no evidence that they discussed the election.NPR's Peter Overby contributed to this report."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/597015218/trump-under-oath-sometimes-combative-often-boastful-usually-lacking-details","In June 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump raised his right hand and swore to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. On the verge of becoming the Republican nominee for president, Trump sat for a videotaped deposition, a familiar experience for a businessman who had sued or been sued thousands of times.  ""I imagine you've had your deposition taken a number of times?"" asked lawyer Deborah Baum, who led the questioning. ""I have, yes,"" Trump answered.Records of President Trump's past depositions show a familiar pattern of boasting, sometimes battling opponents and giving little deference to factual details — pitfalls that could all come into play in various legal cases before too long.Trump says he ""would like to"" testify in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. And he may have to sit for depositions in cases involving women he allegedly had sexual contact with more than a decade ago, whether he wants to or not. Former The Apprentice contestant Summer Zervos sued him for defamation after he denied claims that he had sexually harassed and groped her, and adult film star Stormy Daniels alleges a 2006 sexual encounter and is seeking to get out of a nondisclosure agreement. The stakes of any potential interview with Mueller's team are clearly quite high, but don't underestimate the risks of civil suit depositions. Former President Bill Clinton was impeached after giving false testimony during a civil deposition about a sexual relationship he had with Monica Lewinsky.In the 2016 case, Trump had sued for breach of contract after celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian pulled out of plans to open a restaurant in Trump's Washington, D.C., hotel. Zakarian countersued. At the heart of the disagreement was Trump's disparaging description of Mexican immigrants in the 2015 speech launching his presidential campaign.Trump was more subdued than he is in public, but no less braggadocious, to borrow a word from the president. Trump later mentioned, twice, that he had gotten more votes in the Republican primary than any other presidential candidate in the history of the party. Lawyers who represented Trump in this and other suits either didn't respond or declined to comment for this story. Baum, who represented Zakarian, and two other lawyers who faced off against Trump in high profile cases also declined to be interviewed.In deposition transcripts over the years, Trump comes across as uninterested in details, unfamiliar with legal documents and occasionally impatient. One theme that emerges is preparation. Baum, in the 2016 session, asked Trump what he did to prepare. In a 2011 deposition for a case related to a failed Florida condo and hotel development, the plaintiff's lawyer Elizabeth Beck starts by asking Trump to look at a document.   Early on Beck asks Trump about how involved he is in decision-making at the Trump organization. ""If other people in your organization makes that decision, do they do it with your approval and/or sanction?"" she asked. ""Generally, yes,"" Trump said. ""When would that not be the case?"" Beck asks. ""I don't know of any case where that's not the case,"" Trump responds.But, then, throughout the deposition he repeatedly claims a lack of knowledge, saying details were handled by his children and telling Beck she will have to check with his lawyers or accountant to get an answer. At one point, Trump gets testy. ""I think they're stupid questions you're asking me,"" Trump says. ""I think you're asking very stupid questions."" Whether these were strategic claims of ignorance or simply a lack of familiarity with the document and details is unclear. But it fits a pattern going back to 2007, when Trump sat for two days in a deposition in a suit over the book Trump Nation, The Art of Being The Donald by Tim O'Brien. ""Oh no no no, he did not prepare,"" said O'Brien in an interview with NPR. ""It wasn't even just my sense of it. He was comically unprepared.""O'Brien was the defendant in that lawsuit and spent countless hours working with his attorneys to prepare for his own deposition in the case, poring over binders of documents and refreshing himself on the contents of the book. Trump, he says, exhibited no such preparation, at one point saying he decided the valuation of his golf courses with ""mental projections.""The video of Trump's deposition in that case was never released, but there is a transcript. O'Brien says Trump's past experience under oath provides a cautionary tale for the president and his lawyers.  ""You don't even have to lay a trap if you are asking about a factual circumstance with documents to back it up and the individual at hand, in this case, Donald Trump isn't familiar enough with the fact pattern and has a propensity to exaggerate in the best cases and misrepresent or lie in the worst ones,"" O'Brien said.Take the 2016 deposition, Trump found himself walking back testimony when confronted with documents. When asked about negotiation of the restaurant lease at the heart of the suit, Trump claimed ignorance, saying his adult children handled the details and just told him when the deal was done.But then a few minutes later Baum pulled out a copy of the lease and had Trump look at it. Presented with his own signature, Trump had to admit that he had seen and signed the lease.""Yeah. That's my signature,"" Trump said upon inspection. ""Yes.""Trump ultimately settled with Zakarian for undisclosed terms. And his suit against O'Brien was thrown out. And as the president prepares to potentially talk to the special counsel or face down Zervos or Daniels, there's one tidbit from the 2016 deposition that could work in his favor: Trump claimed not to have a personal paper trail.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/597259426/retired-supreme-court-justice-stevens-calls-for-repeal-of-second-amendment","Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, responding to this past weekend's March For Our Lives in several cities is proposing what some might call a radical solution to prevent further gun violence- repealing the second amendment.In an op-ed in Tuesday's New York Times, the 97 year-old Stevens writes a constitutional amendment ""to get rid of"" the second amendment, ""would do more to weaken the N.R.A.'s ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.""The Second Amendment states that "" A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" Stevens called that concern ""a relic of the 18th century,"" and says repealing it would eliminate the only legal rule that protects sellers of firearms in the United States.  Stevens, who retired from the court in 2010, had two years earlier dissented in the case District of Columbia vs. Heller that determined the Second Amendment allowed an individual right to bear arms. Stevens says he remains convinced that decision was wrong and debatable, and which provided the National Rifle Association with ""a propaganda weapon of immense power.""Stevens' call for repeal of the Second Amendment goes further than most gun control advocates, many of whom have called for banning certain types of weapons, stricter background checks and age limits, but not changing the Constitution.Stevens' proposal immediately lit up Twitter and social media.At least one of the Parkland high school students, Cameron Kasky, reacted to Stevens' op-ed arguing it was ""very interesting considering who wrote it,"" but ""I don't feel the same way.""While Stevens claimed such an action would ""be simple"" it likely would be anything but. Amending the Constitution requires securing two-thirds majorities in both the House and the Senate — and then three-fourths of the states would have to ratify the amendment.Our colleague Ron Elving has much more on the many barriers to amending the Constitution here:"
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/597021235/tumblrs-ban-of-russian-accounts-adds-detail-to-targeting-of-black-americans","Tumblr has listed a number of accounts linked to Russian social media agitation   giving the newest look at a sophisticated effort to sow discord among Americans — including black users.The blogging service announced that it had discovered more than 80 accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, the professional troll farm indicted by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller. Internet Research Agency workers created hundreds of social media accounts across many platforms in an effort to turn up the volume of political disputes taking place among Americans online. That included using fake online accounts to organize real-world political events and posing as black Americans to address real black Americans discussing race, law enforcement and the 2016 political campaign.On Tumblr, the Russians used accounts called ""black-to-the-bones,"" ""blackness-by-your-side,"" ""blacknproud,"" ""blacktolive"" and ""bleepthepolice."" Others were called ""noteverythingiswhite,"" ""starling-all-black-all-day"" and ""weproud2black."" Still other accounts changed their names to drop or pick up apparent black affinity — one went from ""blackprideworldwide"" to ""shoutoutworldwide""; another went from ""heygeraldmartinjohanssen"" to ""ghettablasta"" to ""postingwhileblack.""""Their goal is to sow division and discontent in the countries they target,"" said a post on Tumblr's own official blog. ""What makes them so difficult to spot is that they're not spambots. They're real people who get trained and paid to spread propaganda.""Tumblr sent an email to users identifying accounts with which they may have interacted, but it wasn't clear Monday how much effect the Russian users had over the social media platform. Last year, Tumblr was credited with about 345 million accounts and many more individual users, but there was no immediate information about what kind of total reach the Russian accounts may have had.The largest part of the social media agitation aspect of Russia's active measures campaign probably involved Facebook. It illustrated how a comparatively small effort can achieve larger effects across a network. Russian influencemongers bought a relatively small number of paid ads on Facebook and Instagram, which Facebook owns, but once they had been shared and users began seeing more free content, about 150 million people saw some Russian material, the social media giant said. Black users and Black Lives Matter were a target on Facebook as well, according to Mueller's indictment. The best-known account, ""Blacktivist,"" and others sought to divide black users from within. In another example from Mueller's indictment,  Internet Research Agency influencemongers used the Instagram account ""Woke Blacks"" to encourage followers not to vote for any candidate in 2016.""[A] particular hype and hatred for Trump is misleading the people and forcing Blacks to vote Killary. We cannot resort to the lesser of two devils. Then we'd surely be better off without voting AT ALL,"" a post from the account said. This aspect of Russia's active measures continued a decades-long practice of targeting race inside the United States. More recently, there have been indications that influencemongers piggybacked on real users' protests about news coverage of the Austin bombings — which critics said got short shrift because some of its victims were black — as well as last year's NFL protests, the violence in Charlottesville, Va., and other stories. Tumblr said that it didn't think Russian influencemongers bought any paid ads on its platform. The service said it discovered only human-posted and shared material and urged users to take care.""They want to drive a wedge between us so that we spend our time fighting with each other instead of building towards the future,"" Tumblr's post said. ""We'll be watching for signs of future activity, but the best defense is knowing how they operate and how to judge the content you see."""
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/597244622/3-reasons-gun-companies-are-under-pressure","Remington Arms Co., an American gun company with roots stretching back over 200 years, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Saddled with almost $1 billion in debt and a victim of shifting market trends, Remington, like many other gun companies, face a constant uphill battle wrought with political pressures and changing sentiments on gun ownership. Here are three reasons why gun companies are now struggling to find profits.1. The surprise 'Trump Slump'In the decade before the 2016 election, the firearms industry saw a nationwide boom in gun sales stoked mostly by political fears of new gun control legislation under a renewed Democratic regime. ""First the Democrats got the majority in Congress in 2006, and then Obama got elected in 2008, then in 2012 Sandy Hook."" says Philip Cook, a professor of public policy at Duke University. ""Each of these build on what was already a pretty strong trend."" Gun companies saw a jump in sales, with intermittent spikes in the aftermath of mass shootings. The Federal Bureau of Investigation went from processing nearly 9 million background checks for firearms in 2005, to a record breaking 27 million in 2016. Gun companies anticipated continued growth under yet another Democratic president, and ramped up production. Debt-saddled Remington announced the opening of a new plant in Alabama in 2014. The National Shooting Sports Foundation shows that the gun industry overall saw an 81 percent increase in jobs between 2008 and 2016. All of this came crashing down when Donald Trump, a friend of the gun industry, took office. Speculation of future gun control subsided, buying habits slowed, and gun companies found themselves sitting on stockpiles of weapons they are unable to move as quickly as before.2. Shrinking marketsPew Research Center's latest study on U.S. gun trends shows that 66 percent of gun owners own more than one gun. Some analysts conclude that dips in sales are not just tied to political fears, but the simple fact that the traditional gun purchasing demographic has exhausted itself, and gun companies are just now feeling the pressure. ""Their big money comes from people who amass mini-arsenals,"" says Julius Wachtel, a retired political science professor at California State University Fullerton, and former agent for Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ""They just need more people going out there and buying a lot of guns ... again, culture has shifted."" This has caused many gun companies to expand outside of their traditional markets to look for new potential buyers. ""Everybody is fighting each other to sell firearms to the same group of people,"" says Robert Farago, author of the blog The Truth About Guns. ""There's a huge market untapped that the firearms manufacturers have to go after because they've saturated the market of the enthusiast.""Farago adds that such a challenge will be difficult. Most major media publications won't allow gun manufacturers to advertise on their platform, and recently, traditionally gun friendly online communities such as YouTube and Reddit have closed ranks on content meant to actuate gun sales.3. Product misfiresDuring the glut, many gun companies launched a series of products that did less-than-stellar on the market. Remington faced allegations that its M700 series of rifles fired without anyone pulling the trigger. A class action lawsuit would see the company paying out $12.5 million and agreeing to fix the guns. In 2014, the company released the R51 pistol, which became plagued with production problems and poor reviews. Ruger, another gun company that has seen declining sales in the last two years, took a $2.5 million hit when it issued a recall for its Mark IV line of handguns, citing safety concerns. Ruger also issued a recall for its Precision Rifle series for safety concerns as well.Safety related recalls aside, companies also released a number of products that just didn't appeal to customers. In 2013, Remington took a technological leap to introduce its 2020 line, which included a state-of-the art scope that automated range finding and aided in targeting. The line didn't do well, troubled by reported issues with the advanced optic system, and the hefty  $5,500 price tag also steered customers away. All issues that hurt customer confidence in companies that historically relied on word-of-mouth recommendations and strong quality control."

Such a question is posed in the annual American Community Survey which covers about 3.5 million people.California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement that the state will sue the Trump administration over its decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.And, Democratic Rep. Grace Meng of New York issued a statement: ""I am deeply disappointed with Secretary Ross, and I will now look to introduce legislation to stop this question from being included on the census.""As Hansi reported in January, civil rights groups dispute the Justice Department's need for the data from a citizenship question to help enforce the Voting Rights Act.In his memo, Ross rejected arguments that asking about citizenship will dampen the likelihood that undocumented residents will choose not to be counted for fear that their personal information could be used for law enforcement purposes.He concluded saying that in order to minimize an impact on census response rates, ""I am directing the Census Bureau to place the citizenship question last on the decennial census form."""

Stevens retired from the court in 2010.“That simple but dramatic action would move Saturday’s marchers closer to their objective than any other possible reform,” Stevens said. “It would eliminate the only legal rule that protects sellers of firearms in the United States — unlike every other market in the world.”In his op-ed, Stevens also railed against the 2008 Supreme Court District of Columbia v. Heller decision that established an individual right to bear arms.“That decision — which I remain convinced was wrong and certainly was debatable — has provided the NRA with a propaganda weapon of immense power,” Stevens said. “Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the NRA’s ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.”There has been a renewed push for gun control since February's school shooting in Parkland, Fla.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2018/03/27/south-dakota-follows-states-rebranding-common-core-standards/","South Dakota’s education secretary says the state has officially eliminated the Common Core standards, but a review shows the replacement standards are nearly 75 percent equivalent to the controversial federally incentivized program.“Common Core standards in South Dakota are officially gone,” said state Secretary of Education Don Kirkegaard, according to the Argus Leader, but the report adds:About 60 percent of the K-12 English language arts and math standards approved by the state Board of Education in Pierre last week were taken verbatim from Common Core, according to an Argus Leader analysis.A line-by-line review showed that, in addition to the bullet points taken verbatim, those changed within a few words of the original Common Core language made up nearly 75 percent of the state’s updated standards.The rebranded standards are called “South Dakota State Standards” and will be put in place in the fall of this year.“We don’t call it ‘Common Core,’ but the ghosts are there,” said Art Marmorstein, a Northern State University professor who promotes local control of education.South Dakota’s story is not unlike that of many other states whose parents, teachers, and citizens at large have attempted to get rid of Common Core.Slick state leaders from both parties have sought to eradicate the “toxic” Common Core name from their education websites but were unwilling to give up the federal funding and the waivers from onerous federal regulations attached to the program. Additionally, states and school districts had spent millions on textbooks, digital learning platforms, and state standardized tests – all aligned with Common Core. As a result, there was no real incentive to get rid of Common Core – just make it appear so for political purposes.In 2014, then-Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana and his Education Roundtable drew the ire of grassroots parents when they recommended a “rebrand” of Common Core as the new state standards.Standards expert Dr. Sandra Stotsky, professor emerita at Arkansas University, told Breitbart News at the time that Pence personally asked her to assist in the evaluation process of the state’s new standards. When she saw, however, that the drafts of the new standards were “almost identical to Common Core,” she said she “almost fell off [her] chair.”In 2015, South Carolina announced Common Core was “dead,” but the state’s own oversight committee admitted the “new” replacement standards were 90 percent aligned with Common Core.In 2017, the Arizona state board of education also voted to “rebrand” Common Core.“Common Core has at last been eliminated,” said Arizona schools Superintendent Diane Douglas – who actually campaigned on an anti-Common Core platform. “[W]e now have excellent ELA and math standards developed by Arizonans for Arizona students.”Shane Vander Hart of Truth in American Education, however, observed few changes in the standards.“There have been some technical changes, but as far as I can see most of the foundational problems still exist,” he wrote. “The early elementary standards are still age-inappropriate. There is still an over emphasis on informational text. The math standards still do not adequately prepare students for STEM programs in college.”“It’s unfortunate that Superintendent Diane Douglas, who campaigned on ending Common Core, put her stamp of approval on this process and these standards,” Vander Hart added. “It is also disconcerting that these standards were voted on instead of allowing an additional month of review and public comment. Arizona can do better than this.”Former Republican Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee urged the “rebranding” idea in late 2013. Huckabee told members of the Council of Chief State School Officers – one of the owners of the Common Core standards copyright – they needed to get rid of the Common Core name because it had grown “toxic.”“Rebrand it, refocus it, but don’t retreat,” Huckabee reportedly said.U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has also boarded the “Common Core is dead” bandwagon. DeVos announced in January that “at the U.S. Department of Education, Common Core is dead.”Vander Hart wrote, however, that the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) – engineered by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-TN) and Patty Murray (D-WA) – essentially cemented Common Core into every state in the country.“Sure, the U.S. Department of Education is not actively pushing Common Core, they don’t need to,” he explained. “The standards and assessment consortiums don’t need to be funded anymore. The damage is done. They don’t need to publicly push it because ESSA essentially codified Common Core.”Public support for Common Core fell to a record low in 2016 when it dropped to 50 percent, down from 58 percent in 2015 and from 83 percent in 2013.Nevertheless, Education Dive noted that Timothy Shanahan, a professor emeritus at the University of Illinois at Chicago – and one of the authors of the Common Core – says the standards are still in effect in 42 states.“The federal government has made it an expensive gamble for states to adopt education standards that differ from the Common Core,” wrote Nicholas Tampio, associate professor of political science at Fordham University, noting that “DeVos has approved virtually all [state] plans that include the Common Core or a slightly modified version.”He continued that ESSA provides little incentive for states to get rid of Common Core:In addition, the law requires states to adopt standards that align with “relevant State career and technical education standards.” The main Common Core reading standards are called the “college and career readiness anchor standards.” For states that want to meet this criterion of the law, the safest bet is to keep the Common Core.“[N]early every state that adopted the Common Core during the Obama administration has kept the most important features,” Tampio noted, adding that the claim of DeVos and politicians that ESSA “has repealed the Common Core mandate is misleading.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

As the chief law enforcement officers of our respective states, we place a priority on protecting user privacy, which has been repeatedly placed at risk because of businesses’ failure to properly ensure those protections. Most recently, we have learned from news reports that the business practices within the social media world have evolved to give multiple software developers access to personal information of Facebook users. These reports raise serious questions regarding consumer privacy.Early reports indicate that user data of at least 50 million Facebook profiles may have been misused and misappropriated by third-party software developers (“developers”). According to these reports, Facebook’s previous policies allowed developers to access the personal data of “friends” of people who used applications on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those “friends.” It has also been reported that while providing other developers access to personal Facebook user data, Facebook took as much as thirty (30) percent of payments made through the developers’ applications by Facebook users.Facebook apparently contends that this incident of harvesting tens of millions of profiles was not the result of a technical data breach; however, the reports allege that Facebook allowed third parties to obtain personal data of users who never authorized it, and relied on terms of service and settings that were confusing and perhaps misleading to its users.These revelations raise many serious questions concerning Facebook’s policies and practices, and the processes in place to ensure they are followed. Were those terms of service clear and understandable, or buried in boilerplate where few users would even read them? How did Facebook monitor what these developers did with all the data that they collected? What type of controls did Facebook have over the data given to developers? Did Facebook have protective safeguards in place, including audits, to ensure developers were not misusing the Facebook user’s data? How many users in our respective states were impacted? When did Facebook learn of this breach of privacy protections? During this timeframe, what other third party “research” applications were also able to access the data of unsuspecting Facebook users?In addition to responses to these questions, we request an update about how Facebook will allow users to more easily control the privacy of their accounts. Even with the changes Facebook has made in recent years, many users still do not know that their profile—and personal data—is available to third-party vendors. Facebook has made promises about users’ privacy in the past, and we need to know that users can trust Facebook. With the information we have now, our trust has been broken.Users of Facebook deserve to know the answers to these questions and more. We are committed to protecting our residents’ personal information. More specifically, we need to understand Facebook’s policies and procedures in light of the reported misuse of data by developers. We appreciate the information you have provided to date and expect your full cooperation going forward in our inquiries into your business practices. To that end, we expect a full accounting for what transpired and, answers to the questions we raised above. We look forward to your prompt response.The letter was signed by 37 State Attorneys General from the following states and territories:Alabama

But it felt like she was criticizing Missouri voters.”“I think it is certainly being taken out of context,” she added.“No, Senator, it’s not,” the graphic in the web ad concludes.The first web ad can be viewed here:The second web ad, only 15 seconds long, continues with another McCaskill clip from the MSNBC interview.“If you’ve played by the rules, and worked hard all your life, and you’re further behind this year than you were ten years ago, no wonder you want something completely different,” McCaskill tells the MSNBC reporter.The screen then flashes to this graphic: “Senator McCaskill: In Politics for 30 Years,” followed by another graphic that simply says “Josh Hawley.”You can watch the second web ad here:“Claire McCaskill accidentally told the truth when she defended Hillary Clinton’s insulting comments about ‘backwards’ voters, making the case for why lifetime politicians like herself should be voted out of office. We couldn’t have said it better ourselves,” Hawley campaign spokesperson Kelli Ford said.McCaskill is one of ten Democratic senators up for re-election in 2018 in a state President Trump won.Hawley is the leading candidate to secure the Republican nomination in the August 7 primary.The most recent poll listed on the Real Clear Politics Average of Polls conducted by Gravis Marketing earlier this month shows a potential general election matchup between Republican Hawley and Democrat McCaskill for the U.S. Senate seat in Missouri is a statistical tie.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Democrats sometimes hold a slight lead in modern elections even when Republicans keep their majority on Election Day.Fox News’s generic congressional poll gave Democrats a 15-point lead in October, beating a generic Republican 50 to 35. Now, that poll gives Democrats only a five-point lead, 46 to 41.By contrast, Fox News reports that in 2014, the Democrats held a two-point lead, and Republicans gained 13 seats. That is a gain, not a loss. And in 2010, Republicans held a four-point lead over Democrats and picked up a historic 63 seats in the House to retake control of the chamber.This shift toward the GOP seen in the Fox News poll is also mirrored by other polls. A Quinnipiac poll released on March 5 showed Democrats with a ten-point lead 48 to 38, but that lead was cut almost in half to a six-point lead in a March 20 poll, 49 to 43.While the shift in some of these polls could be attributable to the margin of error, polls during the past couple months have all trended Republican or held steady. The RealClearPolitics average of polls showed a 9.6-point lead for Democrats on February 26, which by March 25 had shifted to only a 5.8-point lead over Republicans.While those polls are for House races, the math in the Senate is overwhelmingly in Republicans’ favor. Democrats must defend three seats for every seat being defended by Republicans. President Trump won ten of the states held by some of those 24 Democrats and won five by double digits.The Fox poll regarding House races consisted of 1,014 registered voters and was conducted March 18–21. It has a margin of error of three percent.Ken Klukowski is senior legal editor for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter @kenklukowski.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

In February, the index hit 130, an 18 year high. The present situation index fell to 159.9 from 161.2, while the expectations index fell to 106.2 from 109.2.“Despite the modest retreat in confidence, the index levels remain historically high and suggest further strong growth in the months ahead,” said Lynn Franco, director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board.The percentage of consumers saying business conditions are good rose to 37.9 percent from 36.5 percent in February. That was offset, however, by a rise in those claiming business conditions are bad, which rose from 11.3 percent to 13.4 percent.Consumers were slightly less optimisitic about the future. The percentage anticipating improving business conditions six months from now fell to 23 percent from 25 percent. Those expecting business conditions to get worse rose to 9.8 percent from 9.4 percent.Those saying jobs are “plentiful” rose to 39.9 percent, up from 39.1 percent last month. Those saying they are “hard to get” fell to 14.9 percent from 15.1 percent. The portion expecting more jobs in the months ahead decreased to 19.1 percent from 22.4 percent.

Mark Amodei (R-NV) told local politics show Nevada Newsmakers Monday that the rumor on Capitol Hill is that Paul Ryan (R-WI) will resign as Speaker of the House in the next 30-60 days, to be replaced by now-Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).Both Ryan and Scalise quickly denied the rumor. “The speaker is not resigning,” Ashlee Strong, spokeswoman for the Speaker, told The Hill just as Amodei’s remarks began to spread like wildfire online.Meanwhile, a Scalise staffer told WDSU-New Orleans the Majority Whip was “proud to serve alongside Speaker Ryan, and fully supports him to remain speaker.”Later, Scalise add in a statement:Our whole leadership team is focused on working with President Trump to deliver more conservative wins for the country, and also ensuring that we keep the majority so we can continue implementing President Trump’s agenda that is getting our economy back on track.Amondei’s staff also appeared to walk back his remarks on Nevada Newsmakers. His Communications Director, Logan Ramsey, emphasized to CNN that her boss was only repeating a “rumor he had heard.”“His response to the question was made explicitly in the context of a rumor, nothing else,” Ramsey said.“The rumor mill is that Paul Ryan is getting ready to resign in the next 30 to 60 days and that Steve Scalise will be the new Speaker,” the Reno Gazette-Journal quotes Amodei’s original remarks.“If it, in fact, it is true, I know that Paul Ryan thinks he wants to play on the national stage in some capacity or another, so I don’t know what that means,” Amodei said, adding, “And my speculation is this: The White House and Paul Ryan would probably not be a great fit.”Ryan has come under heavy criticism from the “Trumpist” wing of the Republican Party he leads in the House, a fact Amodei acknowledged as he discussed the rumor.“Paul was a ‘Never Trumper’ for awhile and then they kind of made up,” Amodei said on Nevada Newsmakers. “Heck, when you talk about the Omnibus [spending] bill, Ryan was down at the White House earlier in the week and I assumed (they were) discussing why there wasn’t more [border] Wall money in there, or something like that.”Ryan has had to deny rumors of his resignation before, including back in December when CNN claimed sources close to him had indicated he would not run again.Scalise, on the other hand, had not featured prominently in speculation about successors for the speakership before Amodei’s candid remarks. The solidly conservative five-term congressman rocketed to national prominence after he was repeatedly shot by a leftist gunman while practicing for the congressional charity baseball game with other Republicans last June.The gunman, James Hodgkinson, “liked” supremely well-funded left-wing group the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) on social media. The SPLC had made several “intelligence report” posts about Scalise implying he was a racist extremist and an associate of David Duke before Hodgkinson “liked” their site.The revelation was eerily familiar to the discovery that Family Research Council-shooter Floyd Lee Corkins II used the SPLC’s “hate lists” before embarking on his would-be rampage. These lists typically include conservative politicians, pro-American immigration think-tanks, and traditional Christian non-profits alongside hundreds of tiny, questionably existent Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups, describing all as “extremists” and “hate groups.”Scalise has served as majority whip, arguably the number three position in the House Republican leadership, since 2014.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"
"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/us/politics/census-citizenship-question-trump.html","Update: Several states said they would sue the Trump administration over its decision to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census, including New York and California. We’ll have a new story shortly.WASHINGTON — The 2020 census will ask respondents whether they are United States citizens, the Commerce Department announced Monday night, agreeing to a Trump administration request with highly charged political and social implications that many officials feared would result in a substantial undercount.In a statement released Monday, the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross had “determined that reinstatement of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire is necessary to provide complete and accurate census block level data,” allowing the department to accurately measure the portion of the population eligible to vote.But his decision immediately invited a legal challenge: Xavier Becerra, California’s attorney general, plans to sue the Trump administration over the decision, a spokeswoman for Mr. Becerra said late Monday.Critics of the change and experts in the Census Bureau itself have said that, amid a fiery immigration debate, the inclusion of a citizenship question could prompt immigrants who are in the country illegally not to respond. That would result in a severe undercount of the population — and, in turn, faulty data for government agencies and outside groups that rely on the census. The effects would also bleed into the redistricting of the House and state legislatures in the next decade.The Justice Department had requested the change in December, arguing that asking participants about their citizenship status in the decennial census would help enforce Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which aims to prevent voting rights violations.“The Justice Department is committed to free and fair elections for all Americans, and has sought reinstatement of the citizenship question on the census to fulfill that commitment,” a Justice Department spokesman, Devin M. O’Malley, told The New York Times in February.In a memorandum explaining his decision, Mr. Ross wrote that he had considered opponents’ arguments about the potential to discourage responses.“I find that the need for accurate citizenship data and the limited burden that the reinstatement of the citizenship question would impose outweigh fears about a potentially lower response rate,” he wrote.The decennial census generally included a citizenship inquiry for more than 100 years through 1950, according to the Commerce Department. And other, smaller population surveys, such as the Current Population Survey and the American Community Survey, continue to ask respondents about it.But critics dismissed administration officials’ reassurances.“The census numbers provide the backbone for planning how our communities can grow and thrive in the coming decade,” said Mr. Becerra. “What the Trump administration is requesting is not just alarming, it is an unconstitutional attempt to discourage an accurate census count.”Others argued that an undercount in regions with high immigrant populations would lead not only to unreliable data but also to unfair redistricting, to the benefit of Republicans.“Adding this question will result in a bad census — deeply flawed population data that will skew public and private sector decisions to ensure equal representation, allocate government resources and anticipate economic growth opportunities — for the next 10 years,” Vanita Gupta, the chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and a deputy attorney general in the Obama administration, said in a statement Monday night. “The stakes are too high to allow this. We urge Congress to overturn this error in judgment.”The announcement of the citizenship question comes at a troublesome time for the Census Bureau: Its top two positions have interim occupants, and it has been forced to skip two of its three trial runs for the 2020 census because of funding shortfalls. If response rates for the census are low, critics worry that the bureau may be unable to adjust the data or deploy enough census takers to low-response communities.The bureau is required to submit a final list of the 2020 census questions to Congress by the end of March.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/us/politics/census-citizenship-question.html","WASHINGTON — The United States census is so much more than just a head count. It is a snapshot of America that determines how congressional seats are apportioned, how state and federal dollars are distributed, where businesses choose to ship products and where they build new stores. To do all that properly, the count needs to be accurate.The Commerce Department’s decision to restore a citizenship question to the census beginning in 2020 is prompting concerns about curtailing participation and possibly undercounting people living in the United States, particularly immigrants and minority groups who are expressing discomfort with answering questions from census workers.Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, acknowledged concerns about decreased response rates in a memorandum released on Monday night. But he said asking about citizenship would enhance the results by helping calculate the percentage of the population eligible to vote.An undercount of the population would have far-reaching implications. It could skew the data that are used to determine how many congressional representatives each state gets and their representation in state legislatures and local government bodies. It would shape how billions of dollars a year are allocated, including for schools and hospitals. It would undermine the integrity of a wide variety of economic data and other statistics that businesses, researchers and policymakers depend on to make decisions, including the numbers that underpin the forecasts for Social Security beneficiaries.Here are several of the commercial, political and research efforts that depend on accurate census data:Divvying up seats in Congress, state legislatures and moreThe Constitution requires the government to enumerate the number of people living in the United States every 10 years, and to use that data to apportion the seats in Congress among the states. The calculation is based on total resident population — which means citizens and noncitizens alike — and it generally shifts power between the states once a decade, in line with population and migration trends.States including Texas, Florida, Colorado and Oregon are projected to gain seats after the 2020 numbers are in. Illinois, Ohio, New York and West Virginia are among the states expected to lose seats. An undercount could shift those projections.Lawmakers also use census data to draw congressional district boundaries within states, an often-controversial process that can help decide partisan control of the House. Census data also underpin state legislative districts and local boundaries like City Councils and school boards.Handing out federal and state dollarsThe federal government bases a large amount of its spending decisions on census data. Researchers concluded last year that in the 2015 fiscal year, 132 government programs used information from the census to determine how to allocate more than $675 billion, much of it for programs that serve lower-income families, including Head Start, Medicare, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Pell grants for college and reduced-price school lunch programs. Highway spending is also apportioned according to census data.Influencing business decisionsTo sell products and services, companies large and small need good information on the location of potential customers and how much money they might have to spend. The census provides the highest-quality and most consistent information on such items, and businesses have come to depend on it to make critical choices.Census data help companies decide where to locate distribution centers to best serve their customers, where to expand or locate new stores and where they have the best chance of seeing a high return on investment. That is why business groups have been particularly concerned about the integrity of that data.“The 2020 census is used to help construct many other data products produced by the federal government,” said Michael R. Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who writes frequently on the importance of census data for policymakers and the private sector.“Some of those products are heavily used by businesses when determining where to open new stores and expand operations, or even what items to put on their shelves. This affects retail businesses, for sure, but businesses in many other sectors as well,” he added.Planning for various health and wellness programsLow response rates from any one demographic group would undermine the validity of various population-wide statistics and program planning.Scientists use census data to understand the distribution of diseases and health concerns such as cancer and obesity across the United States population, including drilling down to race and ethnicity to identify health patterns across demographics. Public health officials then use the data to target their interventions in at-risk communities. Inaccurate census data could lead public health officials to invest in solving a problem that does not exist — or worse, to overlook one that does.“It’s getting harder to conduct the census, due to a variety of factors, including increasing cultural & linguistic diversity, and distrust of the government,” said Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, an economist who directs the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University. “The addition of the citizenship question will make the enumerators’ jobs even harder by heightening privacy concerns and reducing participation among immigrants, who may fear the information will be used to harm them or their families.”Gaming out Social SecurityAn undercount in the census could also impact forecasts about Social Security payouts, which are already increasing as a share of the federal government’s revenue.When Congress plans for the costs of the country’s Social Security needs, lawmakers rely upon demographic projection about the population’s future: the number of children expected to be born, the number of people expected to die, and the number of people expected to immigrate. If baseline data regarding the current population are inaccurate, future projections could be skewed, causing financial challenges down the line.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/business/media/breitbart-news-live-events.html","Breitbart News is taking a step into the live events business.Following the lead of other media companies seeking fresh sources of revenue, the right-wing news and opinion site is set to host its first-ever town hall in suburban New Orleans next month, a panel on privacy and technology with the commentator Ann Coulter and Peter Schweizer, the author of “Clinton Cash.”It’s an experiment for a site that has lately been confronting declining web traffic and turbulence in its top ranks. Stephen K. Bannon, the site’s longtime executive chairman, was forced out in January. Its page views last month were down by nearly half from a year earlier, according to the data-tracking firm comScore, though Breitbart disputes the figure.The Louisiana event is “the latest evolution in how to consume Breitbart content,” said Alexander Marlow, the site’s editor in chief.By branching into public forums, the site is taking a cue from one of its perennial foes: the mainstream media. News outlets like Vanity Fair, The Washington Post and The New York Times have long sponsored conferences and speaking events.The Breitbart event is to be held on April 5 at Andrea’s, an Italian restaurant in Metairie, La. The topic — the gatekeeping power of Facebook and other online platforms — coincides with a broader conservative offensive against Big Tech. Breitbart is one of several right-wing sites that have accused Facebook, Google and Twitter of suppressing right-wing voices, claims that the tech companies have denied.The panel will be live-streamed — on Facebook.Mr. Marlow, who will serve as moderator, said that tickets to the event would be free and that costs would be partly covered by Free Our Internet, a group that bills itself as “fighting the tech-left’s takeover of the internet.”Mr. Schweizer, who collaborated with Mr. Bannon on his investigations into Hillary Clinton, is finishing a documentary about the role of tech companies in filtering the news. Another scheduled guest, Robert Epstein, a former editor of Psychology Today, is expected to be featured in Mr. Schweizer’s film.Breitbart was a champion of Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign, which Mr. Bannon eventually joined. The site has been denounced as misogynist, racist and xenophobic, and its writers routinely flog the establishment media: Last year, its reporters worked to undercut reporting by The Washington Post about misconduct by Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate in Alabama.Mr. Bannon’s ouster, from the White House and then from Breitbart, cut into the site’s cachet. But Breitbart is still among the top-ranked sites on Facebook, and several of its journalists were treated as celebrities at last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference.Facebook’s handling of its users’ data has come under scrutiny in part because of a scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, a company that worked on the Trump campaign and was co-founded by Mr. Bannon. Facebook has banned the company from its platform, saying it misused personal data from Facebook that was provided to it.Mr. Marlow said he knew little about Mr. Bannon’s role in the company, though he defended Cambridge Analytica as engaging in the same kind of data-driven electioneering that left-leaning groups have done in the past.

It indicated that Mr. Hogg had been at school during the shooting, as widely confirmed by many news organizations. He had left campus and then rode his bike back that evening to interview classmates.Video has shown that Mr. Hogg was in a closet during the shooting. Ms. Rumpf eventually found the article and video, and apologized.RedState struck through the old article, but did not describe the update as a correction, seeming to blame the misinformation on confusing reports elsewhere. The false report was spread by well-known conservatives, including Erick Erickson, who has contributed to The New York Times opinion section. Mr. Erickson later deleted his original tweet.A fake image of Ms. González tearing up the Constitution spread quickly over the weekend.The doctored image of Ms. González ripping apart the Constitution of the United States, began to spread during the march on Saturday. It was falsified from a Teen Vogue image in which she was pictured ripping apart a paper shooting target.The image, which exists in a gray area between meme and misinformation, was promoted on Gab, the alt-right alternative to Twitter, and by the right-wing actor Adam Baldwin.Some claimed the image to be satire, and similar memes of President Trump and other political figures appear across the spectrum. But the political scientist Emily Thorson has pointed out that their spread contributes to a climate of misinformation, even if those who see the images understand them to be fake.Ms. González was criticized for wearing a Cuban flag patch.Steve King, the Republican congressman from Iowa, posted on Facebook about the Cuban flag sewn to Ms. González’s jacket.“This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish,” the post said, “and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens; hence their right to self-defense.” It showed an image of her with the flag patch visible on her jacket.The post and similar ones angered other survivors of gun violence and even some of Mr. King’s fellow conservatives, who pointed out that the Cuban flag has long been used by dissidents from the Castro regime.Ms. González retweeted Mr. Hogg’s response to Mr. King: “She’s a beautiful woman of Cuban descent and we love her. You would too if you ever got the chance to meet her.”She also retweeted another of Mr. Hogg’s tweets, which called on Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican of Florida of Cuban descent, to respond to Mr. King.The conservative writer and commentator Dan McLaughlin suggested that reporters ask Ms. González “what the flag means to her and why she wears it.” She did not respond to a call Tuesday.The name-calling continues.Many attacks on the Parkland students do not even pretend to focus on issues or substance. They include the false conspiracy trope that the students are paid actors. Sometimes their appearances and intelligence are mocked, including their efforts to get accepted to colleges this spring.On Sunday, the conservative podcaster and vocal Trump supporter Bill Mitchell referred to Mr. Hogg as a “Damien, Children of the Corn, Hitler-Youth type” on Twitter.The vitriol has sometimes backfired. A Republican candidate for the Maine State House dropped out of the race after calling Ms. González a “skinhead lesbian” and Mr. Hogg a “moron” and a “baldfaced liar.”In a Tuesday interview, Nicole Hockley, whose young son Dylan was killed in the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Conn., advised the students to ignore the attacks as much as possible. She recalled that she had faced conspiracy theories and personal attacks after her 6-year-old son was killed along with 19 other first graders at Sandy Hook Elementary School.She remembered how that felt: “All I’m trying to do is make it so this doesn’t happen to other people and you’re attacking me without a lot of basis.”She said that it was also important to hear rational criticism when trying to find common ground on the issues.When dealing with more reasonable opponents and critics she tries to de-escalate the conversations, she said, to learn more about what they think and educate them about her views.“Sometimes there’s a new perspective that I haven’t considered,” she said, though she rarely finds such views persuasive. Still, she said, those conversations “can bear a lot of fruit.”

Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, announced that he planned to step down, progressives and pro-labor groups saw a rare opportunity to influence an important economic policy appointment over which President Trump has no say.Almost immediately, they drew up a list of demands. They wanted someone who would focus more on promoting employment than on fighting inflation. They wanted a candidate who reflected diversity and who understood the New York region. They wanted a tough regulator who was independent of Wall Street. And they wanted an open search process that would give the public a voice.Instead, the New York Fed’s board appears to be close to appointing John C. Williams, a Fed insider with little regulatory experience and no close connection to New York. He is also, like everyone to hold the job in the bank’s century of history, a white man.“It’s like Exhibit A of how incredibly out of touch the Fed is with what is important and what’s happening in this country,” said Dennis M. Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a Washington-based group that has pushed for stricter financial regulation.Mr. Williams, the 55-year-old president of the San Francisco Fed, is a respected economist and an influential policymaker whose research has drawn praise even from some people critical of his possible selection. He has helped push the Fed to rethink its approach to monetary policy after the financial crisis, and has argued for policies that could lead the central bank to act more aggressively in the next crisis.Janet L. Yellen, the former Fed chairwoman whom Mr. Williams succeeded as president of the San Francisco Fed, called Mr. Williams a leader on the central bank’s policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, known as the F.O.M.C.“He’s a tremendous contributor to the Federal Reserve and the F.O.M.C., and has done influential research on monetary policy,” Ms. Yellen said.But Mr. Williams’s possible appointment — which isn’t yet final and could still change — drew swift criticism from a variety of Democratic lawmakers, progressive groups and left-leaning economists. They raised concerns about his record as a banking regulator and as a policymaker, and also criticized the search process for a lack of transparency.“The New York Fed should go back and restart their search now,” said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College economist who spent 20 years at the Fed.A New York Fed spokesman declined to comment. But in a statement this month, the leaders of the bank’s search committee said they had solicited comment from a variety of groups and had interviewed a range of candidates.In recent years, progressive groups have put increasing pressure on the Fed to diversify its leadership and to become more responsive to public concerns about inequality, slow wage growth and other issues that are outside its traditional mandate of ensuring maximum employment and stable prices. The effort has scored some notable victories, including the appointment last year of Raphael W. Bostic in Atlanta as the first African-American president of a regional Fed bank.Mr. Dudley’s announcement last fall that he would step down represented the movement’s greatest opportunity yet. The president of the New York Fed, unique among the heads of the 12 regional banks, has a permanent vote on the F.O.M.C. and serves as the committee’s vice chairman. The New York bank also plays a crucial role in carrying out the Fed’s policies, and in overseeing many of the country’s largest financial institutions.Those pushing for change had reason to hope their voices would be heard. In the past, the selection of Fed presidents has been heavily influenced by the financial institutions that are formally the stockholders of the Fed’s regional banks. But the regulatory overhaul after the financial crisis removed the banks’ representatives from the selection process. One of the two leaders of the search for Mr. Dudley’s successor is Sara Horowitz, who runs the Freelancers Union, a labor organization. The other, Glenn Hutchins, is a private equity investor.In early March, several dozen protesters marched to the New York Fed’s headquarters in Lower Manhattan to demand an appointee representing workers’ interests. Standing outside the Fed’s imposing stone building on Maiden Lane, Shawn Sebastian, director of the Fed Up campaign, which seeks to make the central bank more responsive to labor concerns, said the board could “make history” by appointing someone without Wall Street ties.“The New York Fed president is the most powerful person in the country that Donald Trump does not get to pick,” Mr. Sebastian shouted to the crowd.Mr. Williams would meet such demands in certain respects. He has spent nearly his entire career inside the Federal Reserve system and, unlike Mr. Dudley, the former chief economist for Goldman Sachs, he has never worked in the finance industry.But Mr. Williams does not have extensive regulatory expertise, and the experience he does have may not help him. He was president of the San Francisco Fed while Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco and is partly under the local Fed’s supervision, engaged in aggressive sales practices that resulted in the opening of millions of accounts without customers’ knowledge.In a statement Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Williams’s record in San Francisco “raises several questions, including about his fitness to supervise Wall Street banks.” She said the Fed’s Board of Governors, which must approve appointments, shouldn’t do so for Mr. Williams unless he testifies before the Senate Banking Committee, which has no formal role in the selection process.Fed insiders said Mr. Williams played at most a limited role in the supervision of Wells Fargo, which is primarily overseen by regulators in Washington. Bank supervision would be a much bigger part of his job if he moved to New York. But Donald Kohn, who served as vice chairman of the Fed’s Board of Governors during the financial crisis, said Mr. Williams would hardly be the first president without substantial regulatory experience. Mr. Dudley’s predecessor, Timothy F. Geithner, for example, served in a variety of government roles before joining the Fed, but had never supervised banks.“He’s been sitting in all these Open Market Committee meetings where increasingly financial stability issues are being talked about,” Mr. Kohn said of Mr. Williams.But critics said selecting Mr. Williams would be a missed opportunity to bring in a new perspective. In a commentary for Bloomberg View on Monday that never mentioned Mr. Williams, Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, noted that the New York Fed has never had a woman or a person of color as its leader.“If we’re serious about creating an inclusive and sustainable economy, no one should be left on the sidelines,” Mr. Booker wrote.

"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/597279176/nra-says-it-receives-foreign-funds-but-none-goes-to-election-work","The National Rifle Association acknowledged that it accepts foreign donations but says it does not use them for election work — even as federal investigators look into the role the NRA might have played in Russia's attack on the 2016 election.Pressure on the organization has also been increased by a McClatchy report that  suggested that the FBI had been investigating whether a top Russian banker with Kremlin ties illegally funneled money to the NRA to aid Donald Trump's campaign for president. The Federal Election Commission has also opened a preliminary investigation into this question. The NRA is not required to be transparent about how money moves among its various political entities, and this leaves questions unanswered about how these foreign funds were ultimately spent.In the context of ongoing investigations, Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, wrote to the NRA earlier this month asking, ""Can you categorically state that your organizations have never, wittingly or unwittingly, received any contributions from individuals or entities acting as conduits for foreign entities or interests?""The NRA said it does receive foreign money but not for election purposes.""While we do receive some contributions from foreign individuals and entities, those contributions are made directly to the NRA for lawful purposes,"" NRA's General Counsel John C. Frazer wrote to Wyden in a letter obtained by NPR. ""Our review of our records has found no foreign donations in connection with a United States election, either directly or through a conduit.""In 2015 to 2016, Frazer continued, the NRA received money from companies based in the U.S. that may be owned or managed by foreign nationals. ""However, none of those entities or individuals is connected with Russia, and none of their contributions were made in connection with U.S. elections,"" Frazer added.The NRA's response was not sufficient for Wyden. In a letter dated March 27, the senator demanded that the organization provide a detailed accounting of how foreign funds were used over the past three years, whether they were targeted at particular American audiences and what the measured impact was. Wyden also demanded to know whether any Russian nationals or foreign individuals had been members of the NRA's donor programs and whether the NRA received any money from sanctioned individuals.While the NRA claims it does not receive foreign money for election purposes, the movement of its money among accounts could make it difficult, if not impossible, to track how the money is spent since it is not isolated or sequestered.The NRA has a variety of accounts, and the NRA Political Victory Fund is its official political action committee and must report all of its spending to the Federal Election Commission. It also has other accounts that require less transparency and do not report spending to the FEC — and in those funds, the NRA told Wyden, the group receives ""funds from foreign persons only for purposes not connected to elections, as permitted by federal law."" However, the NRA acknowledges that money moves among those accounts: ""Transfers between accounts are made as permitted by law,"" the NRA's general counsel wrote.The NRA did not immediately respond to a request from NPR to disclose the total sum of its donations from foreign sources. The NRA has been the subject of criticism for its opposition to gun control measures — criticism that has intensified in the wake of shootings at a high school in Parkland, Fla., last month. The controversy around the NRA and alleged ties to Russia center on one man: Kremlin-linked Russian politician Alexander Torshin. Starting in 2011, Torshin began cultivating ties with the National Rifle Association, establishing relationships with NRA officials, notably former NRA President David Keene. Torshin's relationship with the NRA opened the door to his becoming an election observer in during the 2012 U.S. presidential election and at least five years of attendance at NRA conventions. He even said he knew Donald Trump through the organization.""I know D. Trump (through NRA),"" Torshin once wrote on Twitter. ""A decent person.""The House intelligence committee investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, led by Republicans, reported that ""Donald Trump Jr. briefly met with a Russian government official at the 2016 National Rifle Association annual meeting,"" but the committee found no evidence that they discussed the election.NPR's Peter Overby contributed to this report."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/27/597259426/retired-supreme-court-justice-stevens-calls-for-repeal-of-second-amendment","Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, responding to this past weekend's March For Our Lives events across the nation, is proposing what some might call a radical solution to prevent further gun violence — repealing the Second Amendment.In an op-ed in Tuesday's New York Times, the 97-year-old Stevens writes that a constitutional amendment ""to get rid of"" the Second Amendment ""would do more to weaken the N.R.A.'s ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.""The Second Amendment states that ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" Stevens called that concern ""a relic of the 18th century"" and says repealing it would eliminate the only legal rule that protects sellers of firearms in the United States.  Stevens, who retired from the court in 2010, had two years earlier dissented in District of Columbia v. Heller, which determined the Second Amendment allowed an individual right to bear arms. Stevens says he remains convinced that decision was wrong and debatable and provided the National Rifle Association with ""a propaganda weapon of immense power.""Stevens' call for repeal of the Second Amendment goes further than most gun control advocates, many of whom have called for banning certain types of weapons and establishing stricter background checks and age limits but for not changing the Constitution.Stevens' proposal immediately lit up Twitter and social media.At least one of the Parkland, Fla., students, Cameron Kasky, reacted to Stevens' op-ed arguing it was ""very interesting considering who wrote it,"" but ""I don't feel the same way."" A mass shooting last month at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland left 17 people dead and is the catalyst for the ""March for Our Lives"" movement.While Stevens claimed such an action would ""be simple,"" it likely would be anything but. Amending the Constitution requires securing two-thirds majorities in both the House and the Senate — and then three-fourths of the states would have to ratify the amendment.Our colleague Ron Elving has much more on the many barriers to amending the Constitution here."
"NPR","https://www.npr.org/2018/03/22/593283104/trump-national-security-adviser-h-r-mcmaster-to-resign-be-replaced-by-john-bolto","Updated at 8:20 p.m. ETNational security adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster is leaving the Trump administration, the president announced on Twitter Thursday evening. ""I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend,"" the president wrote. Trump also said former Ambassador John Bolton will replace McMaster in a change that takes effect April 9.The planned change at the top of the country's national security infrastructure comes after McMaster had an unsettled tenure inside a White House that recently has been expelling its top officials like a deflating balloon.In a separate statement, McMaster said he was requesting retirement from the U.S. Army effective this summer. ""I am thankful to President Donald J. Trump for the opportunity to serve him and our nation as national security advisor,"" McMaster said. ""I am grateful for the friendship and support of the members of the National Security Council who worked together to provide the President with the best options to protect and advance our national interests.""In an additional statement issued by the White House, President Trump said McMaster ""helped develop our America First National Security Strategy, revitalize our alliances in the Middle East, smash ISIS, bring North Korea to the table, and strengthen our nation's prosperity. This work and those achievements will ensure that America builds on its economic and military advantages. I thank General McMaster and his family for their service and wish them the very best.""A White House official said Thursday that Trump and McMaster mutually agreed on the resignation, which the two men have been discussing for some time. The timeline for McMaster's departure was expedited, the official also said, because both men felt it was important to have the new team in place, ""instead of constant speculation.""McMaster's departure ""was not related to any one moment or incident; rather it was the result of ongoing conversations between the two,"" the official also said.Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tweeted that McMaster should be ""proud"" of the work he did during his tenure and called him ""one of the great national security minds of our time and a terrific patriot!"" And retiring Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said it had ""been a privilege to work with [McMaster] on some of the most pressing issues facing our country.""McMaster was a storied Army field commander who became a well-known skeptic about bureaucratic indecision at the highest levels in Washington, D.C.He enjoyed support from some in top posts, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, when Trump began searching for a replacement for his disgraced first national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn.Flynn was one of Trump's first close political advisers and an early joiner in his upstart political campaign, but he was forced out over his role in the Russia imbroglio. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's then-ambassador to the United States.So Trump, who never served in the military and never held elected office, needed another counselor and, in a relatively rare decision, picked an active-duty Army general in McMaster.McMaster and Trump at first appeared simpatico in broad aspects of their worldview. They wanted a United States that mixed it up with competing world powers, throwing geopolitical elbows to gain advantage in the way they saw other nations throwing theirs.It fell to McMaster, however, to translate Trump's doctrine on Inauguration Day about ""America First"" into one that could comport with the country's many important global alliances.That's what led to the corollary that ""America First"" didn't mean ""America Alone,"" but it did mean that the U.S. wanted to be a contender as much as a leader.""The president embarked on his first foreign trip with a clear-eyed outlook that the world is not a 'global community' but an arena where nations, nongovernmental actors, and businesses engage and compete for advantage,"" McMaster wrote with Trump's then-chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn — who has also since stepped down.""We bring to this forum unmatched military, political, economic, cultural, and moral strength. Rather than deny this elemental nature of international affairs, we embrace it,"" the two men also wrote.But if Trump liked that vision, he apparently grew to dislike McMaster.According to inside accounts, the two men clashed when McMaster's cerebral briefings crashed into Trump's more freewheeling style.Trump, meanwhile, was bitterly disappointed with what he considered a lack of meaningful new options from McMaster and the Pentagon on the quagmire in Afghanistan.Rather than turning the conflict around sharply or cutting bait altogether, as Trump had considered, the White House made an open-ended commitment to Afghanistan that simply removed any pretense of an end date from the nation's longest war.Then there were the reports — always sourced on background — that McMaster was among those top advisers privately contemptuous of Trump's fitness for the job. Former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly called Trump a ""moron"" and lost his job. McMaster reportedly said Trump had ""the intelligence of a kindergartner"" and now has lost his job."

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/27/spending-bill-passed-by-congress-could-disarm-some-veterans-gop-lawmaker-warns.html","A Republican lawmaker is warning that the $1.3 trillion spending bill approved by Congress last week means more aging veterans could be deprived of owning guns because of a policy that targets those who no longer handle their finances.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., told the House Committee on Rules the bill could “result in more veterans losing the right to keep and bear arms” because it includes an unrelated provision bolstering the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.“At the VA, you have veterans who are losing their right to keep and bear arms every day... if they do so much as just to say to the person interviewing them that 'somebody else manages my finances,'"" Massie said.If that happens, the veteran is blocked from buying or owning any guns.In many cases, those affected say they are of sound mind and are surprised to find themselves blocked from purchasing a firearm.He appealed and waited more than two years for a final answer, which was settled in his favor just this week.Massie says the new bill will make the situation “worse” because it will “apply more pressure on the VA to more diligently put report those veterans' names into the database.”When this happens to a veteran, they have a 30-day window to appeal. If they appeal, the process often takes years and thousands of dollars in legal fees.“VA reports a veteran to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System if he or she is adjudicated as incompetent by the Veterans Benefits Administration for purposes of managing his or her monetary benefits,” a Veterans Affairs spokesman said.The VA spokesman continued: “This process is mandated by law and provides protections for the Veteran, including an opportunity for the Veteran to appeal.”The VA's system mirrors a process set up by the Obama administration that applied the same policy to Social Security recipients. Congress repealed that Obama rule, but a similar measure to end the same practice for veterans died in the Senate.The VA sent more than 35,000 veterans' names to the FBI to be blocked from buying or owning guns in 2017 alone, according to a VA document. The document was obtained by a lawyer named Seth Watkins via a Freedom of Information request, and he provided it to Fox News.More than 200,000 veterans have lost their gun rights since 2010, the documents indicate.“I’m not on the right or the left. There’s just a problem in the mechanics of how this is done,” a Veterans Administration employee told Fox News.“The problem is, there’s no delineation between the individual who is ready to climb up into a clock tower and start shooting, as opposed to the individual who has a touch of dementia and has lost their checkbook,” the employee said.The VA employee requested that he and his job title remain anonymous for fear of retaliation by the VA.Henry Wrobel, 63, a veteran affected by this policy, won his appeal after two years of being on the gun blacklist.“Yesterday I got the pistol permit back again,” Wrobel of Canton, Texas told Fox News on Wednesday.Wrobel said his ordeal began when a lower-level VA hospital person asked him about his finances. He told the employee that his wife suggested it would be easy to set up auto-debit payments.“I set up auto-debit to pay my electric bill, phone bill, insurance, TV,’” Wrobel said. “And out of that, he checked ‘no, his wife does it.’”He prides himself on being good with finances. Wrobel says has bought, improved and sold land and has a credit score over 700.He said he was “treated as a convicted felon” with his “firearm rights” taken.Eventually the VA overturned their decision and asked the FBI to remove Wrobel’s name from the banned list – making him a rare case where a veteran beat the system.“Constitutional rights are so fragile. You’ve got to fight for it... it’s like people don’t want you to have the right to have guns,” Wrobel said.Wrobel won his challenge, but other veterans say they’re giving up hope.“About a year and a half ago, I tried to purchase a firearm to go deer hunting,” Pennsylvania-based veteran Cataldo Amico, 69, told Fox News.But his background check came back denied.He says he told the store clerk: “I don’t have a criminal record, I’ve never spent time in an insane asylum – where do you get this from?”Multiple calls to government agencies later, Amico was told he had been “adjudicated mentally defective.”“I think -- what the hell are they talking about?” he recalled. “Nobody ever informed me of this. I just want to get back in the woods with deer hunting, you know?”Amico said the only thing he can think of is that he was treated for depression years back – but he says he’s felt better for a long time and is on no medications.He says he got nowhere talking with the VA, as the window for a normal appeal was past. He paid several hundred dollars for a lawyer to put in a formal complaint, but the VA response came back: go ahead, sue us.He asked his lawyer what it would cost to sue. “He said, it could cost $7,500 to take them to court. I says, ‘what? I can’t do that. That’s a lot of money for a middle-class guy.’”“Not only that, the wheels of justice turn slowly... I’m in very good health for a guy who’s 69, but this could take years -- if I ever got cleared,”“To be honest with you, I’m kind of giving up hope,” Cataldo said. “It would take an act of God to fix this.”Maxim Lott can be reached on Twitter at @maximlott."

And they claimed Mueller wasn't even investigating their client for any possible collusion.Manafort lawyer Kevin Downing filed a motion in federal court to dismiss the “superseding indictment” brought by Mueller in early February, noting that “the charges against Mr. Manafort do not ‘arise directly from’ the special counsel’s investigation.”  “The DOJ well knew about both of those supposed crimes because it had already investigated Mr. Manafort about them,” it said. “The special counsel thus cannot credibly claim that he discovered them because of his original investigation.”Manafort’s attorneys added: “Indeed, the special counsel has never suggested that Mr. Manafort had anything to do with alleged 'coordination [with] the Russian government,' or even that he is investigating Mr. Manafort on that subject.”Manafort pleaded not guilty to the new round of charges, just as he he'd done to the first round in October, but Gates pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and lying to the FBI. Mueller’s team then moved to dismiss the superseding indictment against Gates.Gates has intimate knowledge of Manafort’s years of political consulting work in Ukraine, as well as other events that sparked the interest of federal investigators.Despite Gates’ guilty plea, Manafort has said that he will “continue to maintain my innocence,” and that he “hoped and expected” Gates would have had “the strength to continue the battle to prove our innocence.”Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III, who is assigned to the superseding indictment in Virginia, suggested that Manafort could face life in prison, and “poses a substantial flight risk” because of his “financial means and international connections to flee and remain at large.”“Specifically given the nature of the charges against the defendant and the apparent weight of the evidence against him, defendant faces the very real possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison,” Ellis wrote.Fox News' Kelly Phares contributed to this report. "
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/27/finally-some-real-talk-about-second-amendment.html","**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day? Sign up here.** On the roster: Finally, some real talk about the Second Amendment - All signs point to Senate run by Scott - Trump tries to add to legal team, gets denied - Calif. to sue Trump over census citizenship question - ‘Are we good?’FINALLY, SOME REAL TALK ABOUT THE SECOND AMENDMENTSupporters of gun control measures have been quick to blame corrupt lawmakers and their NRA paymasters for the failure to pass meaningful legislation restricting firearms in the era of mass shootings. And while there’s no doubt that the NRA has been astonishingly successful as a pressure group over the past 20 years, arguments that focus on the power of the association tends to overlook a key fact: The gun control measures proffered in the wake of these mass murders by and large would have done little, if anything, to have prevented the massacres that inspired them. Most conspicuously, in the wake of the carnage at a Connecticut elementary school just before Christmas in 2012, gun control advocates settled upon and rallied behind a proposal to beef up the system of background checks on legal firearms purchases. That had absolutely nothing to do with how a mentally ill 20-year-old killed 20 children between the ages of 6 and 7 and six adults in the span of about five minutes. He took the weapons from his mother, who was his first victim that day. He did not buy them in the parking lot of a gun show or on the internet. He just took them. Legislation restricting the sale or transfer of firearms from one individual to another sounded like too little and too much at the same time. There was no obvious point of the legislation other than placating upset voters, and time and distractions do a better job than political placation anyway. Proponents couldn’t do any better because they ran up hard against two truths: Americans at the time of the massacre were mostly opposed to tighter gun laws and the Second Amendment to the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court since 2008 prevents the kinds of firearms restrictions common in most of the world. In the wake of the most recent mass shooting at a school, which claimed 14 teenaged students and three staff members at a high school in Florida on Valentine’s Day of this year, will things be different?    There’s plenty of reasons to think that the answer is yes. The well-organized, affecting, lavishly covered efforts by the survivors of the latest rampage to push for gun control may play a part, but two other changes are likely to matter more.  First, opposition to gun control, which started to rise in the era of insecurity following 9/11 and then reached an outright majority during Barack Obama’s first term in the White House, has dropped dramatically in the years since the Newtown, Conn. murders.  By late last year, Gallup found that 60 percent of adults wanted stricter firearms regulations while 38 percent wanted current rules maintained or relaxed. In the fall of 2011, by comparison, 55 percent wanted the status quo or less for gun regulations and 43 percent, an all-time low, wanted stricter rules. Second, and perhaps more important, gun control proponents have started to talk more frankly about the Second Amendment.  In an op-ed at the NYT today, former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens came out and said what many on his side have been conditioned to resist saying for decades: Repeal the Second Amendment. “Overturning [the Supreme Court’s decision in the 2008 case of District of Columbia v. Heller] via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the N.R.A.’s ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.” The NRA and other gun rights proponents were quick to glom on to the former justice’s piece as evidence of the gun control lobby’s gun-grabbing impulses. And many on the gun control side no doubt winced at the damage to a core talking point for the movement. But the talking points in this debate are way past stale. It’s time for some new ones on both sides. The tension between the first clauses and the last clauses of the Second Amendment is between the question of “why” and the question of “how.” Why did the Founders and their generation believe that the government should be forbidden from disarming Americans? “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State…”  How did the Founders and the state lawmakers of 1791 believe this should be achieved? “[T]he right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” The Founders gave us the amendment process for a reason, though Americans have substantially abandoned it in the past 30 years. That’s partly a result of parties and politicians more interested in preserving disputes for the purposes of vote getting and fundraising, and also, just as sadly, because of a deepening civic ignorance in our electorate. It’s long past time for America to have a frank, grown-up debate about the tension between the two parts of the Second Amendment – “well regulated” and “shall not be infringed.”  Whatever you may think about Steven’s personal position, we all ought to thank him for acknowledging the real issue at hand. We owe our forebears and the victims of these monstrous crimes a worthy debate. THE RULEBOOK: IS THAT REASONABLE? “[Without a Constitution] we may reasonably expect, from the gradual conflicts of State regulations, that the citizens of each [state] would at length come to be considered and treated by the others in no better light than that of foreigners and aliens.” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 22TIME OUT: MAESTRO OF THE MOUNDESPN: “Clayton Kershaw cracked open a window into the future on May 25, 2008.

Rick Scott announced Monday that his chief of staff, Jackie Schutz Zeckman, resigned Sunday to pursue other opportunities, stoking fresh speculation that Scott's candidacy for the U.S. Senate is days away. Scott tweeted on Monday that he will make a ‘big announcement’ on Facebook Live on Monday, April 9. Her replacement is Brad Piepenbrink, 32, who has served as a deputy chief of staff and earlier ran Scott's external affairs operation and worked on his 2014 re-election campaign. The change is effective immediately. The departure of Schutz Zeckman is sure to intensify speculation that Scott is nearing an announcement that he will seek the U.S. Senate seat held since 2001 by Bill Nelson. Nelson, 75, a Democrat, defeated Republican Bill McCollum in 2000 and has not been seriously tested since. He breezed to re-election victories over Katherine Harris in 2006 and Connie Mack IV in 2012.”GOP looks to avoid another special election fiasco - Politico: “National Republicans are moving to head off another special election fiasco — this time in a deep-red Arizona congressional district teeming with retirees that would never register as even remotely competitive in a normal election year. Two weeks after the party’s stunning defeat in a conservative district in southwestern Pennsylvania, Republicans are funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars into Arizona’s 8th District, which President Donald Trump won by more than 20 percentage points in 2016. The National Republican Congressional Committee on Monday launched a coordinated, $170,000 TV buy with the campaign of candidate Debbie Lesko, according to a source familiar with the purchase. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a deep-pocketed GOP super PAC, is planning to spend about $100,000 on a phone and digital effort aimed at turning out conservative voters. Early voting starts on Wednesday.”Kraushaar: ‘Stop the Gerrymandering Scaremongering’ - National Journal: “Even as Democrats are storming their way towards a takeover in the House of Representatives, the issue of gerrymandering remains an obsession for many progressive activists. These redistricting pessimists are like Boston and Cleveland sports fans who insisted their teams were cursed… In order to justify the argument that gerrymandering is making it exceedingly difficult for Democrats to win the House, they have to gloss over the mounds of evidence that point to the possibility of a historic House landslide for Democrats. Experts aren’t just anticipating a narrow Democratic House takeover; top forecasters are hinting at gains as high as 45 seats. The Cook Political Report lists 48 Republican-held seats as highly vulnerable, with another 25 potentially in play. … But the anti-gerrymandering caucus, driven by an ideology of victimhood, continues its naysaying.”GOP loses best bet to keep Maine governorship - Bangor Daily News: “Maine Senate President Mike Thibodeau dropped out of the Republican gubernatorial primary on Monday, becoming the highest-profile candidate to leave the race so far and reducing his party’s field to four ahead of the June election. Thibodeau made the announcement in a Facebook post, citing his leadership position in the Legislature and business obligations as reasons for leaving the race, saying ‘there just isn’t time to do all of these things and run for governor at the same time.’ Thibodeau came up in Maine politics as a steady social conservative, but he has become best-known for recent battles with Gov. Paul LePage, a fellow Republican who is looming over the intraparty race to pick his successor.”TRUMP TRIES TO ADD TO LEGAL TEAM, GETS DENIED Politico: “A pair of veteran white-collar lawyers have turned down President Donald Trump’s offer to help lead his defense in the Russia probe, marking another setback for a legal team that’s seen its numbers dwindle over the past week while it prepares for a potentially critical interview between the president and special counsel Robert Mueller. The law firm Winston & Strawn said Monday night that two of its partners — former federal prosecutors Tom Buchanan and Dan Webb — were approached by Trump but declined the job ‘due to business conflicts.’ ‘However, they consider the opportunity to represent the president to be the highest honor, and they sincerely regret that they cannot do so,’ the law firm said. ‘They wish the president the best and believe he has excellent representation in Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow.’ Trump’s legal team is now led by Cobb, who is handling official White House matters in response to Mueller’s investigation, and Sekulow… the public face of the president’s outside legal team.”Shulkin is safe ‘at this point in time’ - Politico: “President Donald Trump has confidence in David Shulkin ‘at this point in time’ despite reports that the Veterans Affairs secretary may be fired as early as this week, White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said on Monday. ‘We all serve at the pleasure of the president. If he is not pleased, you‘ll know it,’ Gidley said in an interview on Fox News. ‘At this point in time though, he does have confidence in Dr. Shulkin. He is a secretary and he has done some great things at the VA. As you know, the president wants to put the right people in the right place at the right time and that could change.’ … When pressed about reports on Monday that Trump would like to fire Shulkin but doesn’t have a replacement, Gidley said, ‘When the president wants to make a change, he will make it.’”WH probing Kushner family business - WSJ: “White House attorneys are examining whether two loans totaling more than $500 million to Jared Kushner’s family business may have violated any criminal laws or federal ethics regulations, according to a letter from a federal ethics agency made public Monday. The Office of Government Ethics told a Democratic lawmaker in the letter that the White House is probing whether a $184 million loan from the real-estate arm of Apollo Global Management LLC and a $325 million loan from Citigroup Inc. may have run afoul of the rules and laws governing the conduct of federal employees.”Trump pines for Porter - NYT: “President Trump has stayed in touch with Rob Porter, the former White House staff secretary who stepped down after allegations that he had abused his two former wives came to light, according to three people familiar with the conversations, and has told some advisers he hopes Mr. Porter returns to work in the West Wing. The president’s calls with Mr. Porter have increased in the last few weeks, as the number of people he is close to in the White House has dwindled because of the large number of staff departures, the people familiar with the calls said. In Mr. Trump’s orbit, few people are ever permanently exiled. He often sees aides who are subject to public criticism as extensions of himself, coming under fire because critics want to attack him…”CALIF.

"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/27/senator-will-introduce-bill-that-would-send-illegal-border-crossers-immediately-back-to-home-country.html","BROWNSVILLE, Texas –  Oklahoma’s senior senator says he has a novel way to end the controversial practice of “catch and release” on the border.Instead of releasing illegal immigrants once they are caught trying to enter the country – and hope they show up to immigration court – Sen.  Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., proposes sending them back to their home country. That way, he said, the illegal immigrants don’t become “absorbed” in the U.S. after they fail to show up to court.A large number of illegal immigrants who are caught, then released, fail to show up to immigration court, he said. They end up staying in the county illegally, he said.President Trump signed an executive order last year to end “catch-and-release,” when illegal immigrants are detained and let go in the U.S. But his plan, to keep the immigrants detained until their court proceedings have ended, was stymied by a years-long backlog in immigration court and shortage of beds at detention centers.""The reason why 70 percent of [undocumented immigrants] don't make their court date is because [the federal government doesn’t] make them stay in their country,” he said. “And, obviously, if I were in that position, I'd be off someplace else too."" A report released last year by the Center for Immigration Studies said about 46,000 illegal immigrants a year who are detained after illegally crossing the border do not appear in court and “disappear” in the county.Inhofe’s office did not comment on the details of his proposal, saying the legislation is still being drafted.But his proposal has come under fire from immigration groups who call it inhumane and logistically impossible.Aida Montanaro-Flores, an immigration attorney in Brownsville, said it would be a financial burden to send the immigrants back to their country and then require them to make a trip back for a court hearing.“Are they going to be allowed a travel permit? Will the government pay for their travel to come back to the country and attend their court dates?” Montanaro-Flores asked. “What guarantees do we have that they they’ll be allowed to come back for their court date?”Other immigration groups said the idea was outright ridiculous.“Have we really stooped this low? This suggestion is absurd, illogical and cruel – not to mention a waste of resources,” said Kica Matos, director of the Washington, D.C.-based Immigrant and Racial Justice at the Center for Community Change. “Republicans need to focus on making communities safer instead of continuing to tear families apart.”"
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/27/mitt-romney-says-is-more-conservative-on-immigration-than-trump.html","Mitt Romney claimed Monday that he is more conservative than President Trump on immigration, expressing skepticism about allowing recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to gain a path to citizenship.Romney, who is running for outgoing Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch’s Senate seat, made the comments at a question-and-answer in Provo, describing himself as a “hawk” on immigration.“For instance, I’m a deficit hawk,” the 2012 Republican presidential nominee said, according to Utah's The Daily Herald. “That makes me more of a conservative than a lot of Republicans and a lot of Democrats. I’m also more of a hawk on immigration than even the president. My view was these DACA kids shouldn’t be allowed to stay in the country legally.""Trump briefly considered vetoing the bill, both over the lack of funding for border security and also the failure to provide a legislative fix for the expiring DACA program. He told DACA recipients that “Republicans are with you” and blasted Democrats for not doing enough to come up with a legislative solution.TRUMP, GOP LEADERS FACE BACKLASH OVER $1.3 TRILLION SPENDING PACKAGE “Now I will accept the president’s view on this, but for me, I draw the line and say, those who’ve come illegally should not be given a special path to citizenship,” he said.A spokesman later clarified Romney’s remarks to The Boston Globe, ruling out support for a pathway to citizenship but agreeing that President Obama’s DACA commitment should be honored.“President Obama enacted DACA and Gov. Romney believes the commitment made by President Obama should be honored,” the statement said. “Therefore, he agrees with President Trump’s proposal to allow DACA recipients to legally stay in the country but does not support a special pathway to citizenship.” "
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/27/sexism-didn-t-defeat-hillary-clinton-wild-untruths-about-emails-are-why-shes-not-madam-president.html","There's a new book out by Hillary Clinton's former communications director, Jennifer Palmieri, suggesting that sexism by American voters – not Clinton's email scandal – was the key factor responsible for Clinton’s loss to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.Palmieri writes in her book – titled “Dear Madam President” – that Clinton couldn't get out of the email “box” because American voters couldn’t get past their “unease” about a woman seeking power.In fact, Palmieri goes on to suggest that the Clinton email issue was both trivial and irrelevant – notwithstanding the fact that a Reuters poll just six weeks before the election showed a significant 46 percent of Americans were “very concerned” about that very issue.Clinton's problem was that many Americans didn't trust her because she was caught telling untruths – repeatedly – about her email system. She first told us it was simply a matter of convenience to use her unsecure, non-government email system. That wasn't true.Then the Democratic presidential candidate told us she turned over all the government emails that she had. That absolutely was not true.And the kicker was Clinton’s attempted deletion of over half the emails she supposedly took with her when she left the State Department – 33,000 in total.On top of that, there is the pay-to-play scandal that Judicial Watch uncovered in August of 2016 that raised further legal issues about Clinton’s conduct as secretary of state.Palmieri’s suggestion that sexism made it impossible for Clinton to explain her way out of the email scandal insults all voters. The real concern – among male and female voters alike – was about putting someone into high office who had such utter contempt for the rule of law.Recall that Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination  back in 2008 thanks in part to his argument that Bill and Hillary Clinton’s record of corruption would be an albatross during the general election.Just a few months ago, we disclosed the classified emails from the Clinton email server found on the laptop of Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s scandal-ridden husband, disgraced former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y. It was one more instance of misconduct in a serial violation of national security laws that would have gotten anyone else arrested.This “trivial and irrelevant” email scandal resulted in a FBI investigation into whether Clinton was in violation of criminal laws concerning the handling of classified information. She escaped prosecution because of the political intervention of the Obama White House, FBI and Justice Department leadership. Palmieri’s book shows that Clinton wasn't the only person on her campaign oblivious to the way people perceived her misconduct. While Palmieri does a poor job of explaining the Clinton email scandal, she does a good job of showing how Clinton’s aides enabled her misbehavior."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/03/27/putin-russia-and-hard-truth-about-election-meddling.html","President Trump’s order Monday to expel 60 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers from the U.S. in retaliation for the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Britain has sent U.S.-Russian relations to their lowest point yet during the Trump administration.The U.S. joined at least 22 other nations in expelling Russian officials in support of Britain, after the British blamed Russia for the March 4 attack on former Russian spy Sergei V. Skripal and his daughter with a deadly nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union. Both remain hospitalized in critical condition.  Just about all Americans, regardless of political party, can agree that Russian President Vladimir Putin is an aggressive leader who is one of our greatest geopolitical adversaries – not just because of the poisoning in Britain, but because of a series of other actions he has taken.  Alternatively, President Trump could seek an accommodation with Russia to resolve as many of our differences as possible. But isn’t accommodation with a dictator who denies his people many freedoms that we take for granted beyond the pale?Given the number of times we’ve sought a deal with the North Koreans – only to be lied to repeatedly and be treated as patsies – do you think them more trustworthy than Putin? And while Russia interfered with our 2016 presidential election, Kim has threatened to nuke the U.S. On the scale of things, isn’t that a wee bit more serious?But let’s talk about the meddling by the Russians in our presidential election. In monetary terms, it was small potatoes. And if the Russians had wanted to disrupt our politics, it’s unlikely they could have done very much in 2016 or this year.We’re already at peak craziness. Was it the Russians who prompted Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., to call for progressives to fight in the streets?  Did the Russians ask Hillary Clinton to join the resistance? Do they edit the Washington Post and New York Times, or operate CNN and MSNBC? We don’t need the Russians to make a mockery of American politics. We do it all by ourselves.And if we are to take further actions against Russia’s meddling in our elections past and future, just what might we do? The First Amendment to our Constitution bars the federal government from interfering with free speech and freedom of the press. If our government tried to censor what is said on the Internet and in the media about our elections, such an action would be unconstitutional.Instead, it makes the most sense to respond to Russia’s interference in our election by going on the offense, tit-for-tat. If the Russians interfere in our elections, we should interfere in their elections.But guess what? We’re interfering with Russia’s internal politics already – and we were doing it long before the Russians started meddling on social media sites. If they messed with us, we had started it and it was they who were playing tit-for-tat.The U.S. government has a long record of supporting pro-democracy non-governmental organizations that seek to subvert undemocratic governments in other countries.For example, the National Endowment for Democracy is funded primarily by U.S. taxpayer dollars with a mission of exporting democracy. It does so around the world.In Russia, the National Endowment for Democracy has directed its grants to organizations that employ Putin’s opponents or that engage activists to foster civil engagement. When the Russians enacted their Undesirable Organizations Law in 2015 to bar such activity, the first group banned was – unsurprisingly – the National Endowment for Democracy.In truth, America has a long history of messing with other countries, beginning with our invasion of Canada in 1775.On the right, conservatives have decried our support for regime change in Libya and our efforts at nation-building in the Arab world in recent years.People on the left are apt to remember our support for the right-wing rebel group known as the Contras in Nicaragua under President Reagan, or our ousting of democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in Iran under President Eisenhower.In a more recent example of taking sides in a foreign election under cover of supporting democracy, in 2015 President Obama’s State Department gave $350,000 to an Israeli group – ostensibly to seek an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.In reality, the $350,000 was spent to build a voter database and train activists to oppose the democratically elected government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who Obama detested.So where does that leave us? We might either shut down our efforts to export our ideals or expect that if we mess with Putin he’ll mess with us.President Trump largely favors the former strategy. He’d like to slash the budget of the National Endowment for Democracy and clip its wings. He doesn't believe we should seek to export democracy, except by way of providing an example for other countries.Such a move would be a radical break in the American tradition of defending democracy abroad – and one we should not make.With all the mistakes we’ve made – with all the ways in which the cause of exporting democracy has been used to excuse foreign wars – the ideal of liberal democracy is worth defending and even exporting.We did so to resist communism and have no apologies to make on that score. So let’s keep the National Endowment for Democracy, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Voice of America and support democracy and freedom in other parts of the world.But if we do these things, let’s be realistic. It’s naïve to think we’ve heard the last from Russian trolls. As we do unto others, they do unto us."
"Fox News","http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/27/dems-decry-craven-attack-on-our-democracy-over-citizenship-question-on-census.html","Democrats are blasting the Trump administration for a “craven attack on our democracy” this week, in the wake of its decision to ask 2020 census respondents if they are citizens of the United States.On Monday, the Commerce Department said in a statement that the citizenship question would be added to the 2020 census in response to a request made by the Justice Department in December 2017. The statement said that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross “has determined that reinstatement of a citizenship question on the 2020 decennial census questionnaire is necessary to provide complete and accurate census block level data.”The decennial census count is required by the Constitution and its results are used to determine federal spending, as well as the number of congressional seats allocated to each state for the next decade, as well as the number of electoral votes available from each state.Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez slammed the move, assuring Americans that Democrats would “fight this attempt to undermine our democracy.”“This is a craven attack on our democracy and a transparent attempt to intimidate immigrant communities,” Perez said in a statement. “The census is a constitutionally-mandated count of all U.S. residents, not a political tool for Donald Trump to push his agenda and disempower Latinos and other people of color.”And just hours after the announcement, California’s Attorney General Xavier Becerra promised to sue the administration, calling the measure “illegal.”“Including the question is not just a bad idea –it is illegal,” Becerra tweeted Monday. Former Attorney General Eric Holder also promised to “litigate to stop the administration from moving forward with this irresponsible decision.”“The addition of a citizenship question to the census questionnaire is a direct attack on our representative democracy,” Holder said in a statement on Monday evening following the administration’s announcement. “This question will lower the response rate and undermine the accuracy of the count, leading to devastating, decade-long impacts on voting rights and the distribution of billions of dollars of federal funding.”Holder added: “Make no mistake—this decision is motivated purely by politics.”House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also blasted the Trump administration’s measure as a “dog-whistle tactic to raise funds for his campaign committee.”Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., introduced the 2020 Census Improving Data and Enhanced Accuracy Act, to prevent the question from being added to the census.“This is a deliberate effort to politicize the census for partisan gains that violates the standards set forth in the Constitution mandating an accurate count of the nation,” Maloney said in a statement. “Congress should block this action by passing the Census IDEA Act, which I introduced last week. We cannot accept an incomplete or unfair count in 2020—too much is at stake.” Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., introduced a similar piece of legislation in the Senate.But the Commerce Department said that almost every decennial census between 1820 and 1950 “asked a question on citizenship in some form.”The department also said the citizenship question would be “the same as the one that is asked on the yearly American Community Survey (ACS),” which is sent to a much smaller percentage of American homes than the actual census.But Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, and Ted Cruz of Texas are praising the move, calling it a “reasonable, common-sense addition” to the census.“It is imperative that the data gathered in the census is reliable, given the wide-ranging impacts it will have on U.S. policy,” Cruz said in a statement.Census counts are taken by mail and by workers going door to door. The Census Bureau said that the 2010 census drew a massive response, with about 74 percent of households mailing in forms, and the remaining households counted by workers in neighborhoods. Fox News’ Samuel Chamberlain and The Associated Press contributed to this report. "

Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) in a March 22 letter that the White House Counsel’s Office had informed him that they were investigating whether Kushner’s dealings were legal.“I have discussed this matter with the White House Counsel’s Office in order to ensure that they have begun the process of ascertaining the facts necessary to determine whether any law or regulation has been violated,” Apol wrote in the letter that was released on Monday. “During that discussion, the White House informed me that they had already begun this process.”On Monday evening, Kushner’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, also reportedly said in a carefully worded statement that “the White House counsel concluded there were no issues involving Jared.”The New York Times previously reported that Apollo Global Management and Citigroup gave Kushner’s real estate company massive loans after its executives met with Kushner in the White House. Joshua Harris, Apollo’s head, reportedly gave Kushner’s company a $184 million loan after a White House meeting in which Harris also discussed a possible White House job opportunity. Citigroup, the Times reported, also gave Kushner’s company a $325 million loan after its CEO met with Kushner in the White House.Both companies have claimed that the loans were appropriate.On Monday evening, Krishnamoorthi told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow that Apol’s revelation that the White House was investigating whether Kushner violated any laws “was a surprise” to him.“So now we’re following up,” he continued, referring to “potential bribery laws in addition to ethical violations.”He said the Democrats could take back the House in November and if the White House does not provide answers now, “they are going to be sought later as well.”“The whole gist of it is a public official has to put national interests first, personal interests second,” Krishnamoorthi said. “And the whole question here with Jared Kushner is whether he reversed it and put his personal interests first at the expense of the public interest.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

But while we have weathered yet another year against a microscopic enemy which constantly threatens to evolve beyond our ability to inhibit with vaccination, the CDC says we are not out of the woods just yet.According to the Weekly U.S. Influenza Surveillance Report published for the week ending March 17, a secondary or “B-strain” of the flu grew significantly in reported cases, despite an overall decline in flu activity across the country. Almost 58% of all reported cases were caused by the typically less dangerous — but still very serious — cousins of our immunological foe.CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund advised caution. “We know that illness associated with influenza B can be just as severe as illness associated with influenza A,” Nordlund said. “We also know that influenza B tends to be more severe for younger children.”Still, this second wave is not entirely unexpected, according to Nordlund. “We often see a wave of influenza B during seasons when influenza A H3N2 was the predominant virus earlier in the season,” she said. “Unfortunately, we don’t know what the influenza B wave will look like.”Nearly a quarter-million people have been confirmed as flu victims this year, and 133 children have already perished in the 2017-2018 season alone.Of course, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to advise the public to vaccinate. It remains the best guarantor against infection and supports the “herd immunity” that protects our most vulnerable citizens, from the very young to the very old.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Police put surveillance on the illegal alien and eventually caught him with a jewelry box, a pair of keys, and cash.When police tracked the jewelry and keys to Harris’s residence, they found her dead inside with a pillow reportedly near her body.After being arrested for capital murder, the illegal alien could possibly be linked to multiple other deaths, according to FOX 4 News sources. For example, the source says Chemirmir was on the scene of multiple elderly deaths where police previously believed the individuals had died of natural causes.Now, police are retracing their steps to about 750 deaths of elderly women to investigate whether or not the illegal alien was involved with their deaths, according to WFAA.Since Chemirmir was charged with murder, two elderly women have come forward to tell police that the illegal alien had attempted to kill them by sitting on their chest and smothering them with a pillow.The illegal alien is being held on a $1 million bond and should he be released, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has requested that he be turned over to them for deportation.John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Fusion GPS was paid for its anti-Trump work by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign and the Democratic National Committee via the Perkins Coie law firm.The book, Russian Roulette: The Inside Story of Putin’s War on America and the Election of Donald Trump, is authored by reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn.In their work, Isikoff and Corn relate Simpson and Fusion GPS set up a series of off-the-record briefings with reporters at the Tabard Inn in Washington, DC. At these briefings, Steele informed the individual reporters of the claims inside the dossier.Isikoff and Corn write that Simpson had hoped the briefings would prompt reporters to call the FBI about the dossier charges so that the bureau would take the claims more seriously.They write:At this point, Simpson knew something that almost nobody else did: Steele had given his initial reports to the FBI and the Bureau was reviewing them. So he figured out a way to put Steele’s material to use. He would bring Steele to Washington and have him brief a small number of reporters. Then, he hoped, the reporters would tap their sources and sniff out what the FBI was doing with all of this. It might even prod the Bureau to take Steele’s reports more seriously.Isikoff was one of the reporters present at the briefings, the authors reveal.The authors write that the Tabard briefings were attended by “reporters for the New York Times, the Washington Post and CNN, and Yahoo News’ Michael Isikoff.”In a recent article, New Yorker staff writer Jane Mayer reported that she personally attended one of the meetings at the Tabard and that “these encounters were surely sanctioned in some way by Fusion’s client, the Clinton campaign.” However, she wrote that at the time, Steele “provided no documentary evidence” and “neither the New Yorker nor any other news organization ran a story about the allegations.”The book, meanwhile, also states that Victoria Nuland, a senior official in John Kerry’s State Department, gave the green light for the FBI to first meet with Steele regarding his claims about Trump and Russia.It was at that meeting that Steele initially reported his dossier charges to the FBI, the book relates.The dossier was reportedly utilized by the FBI to launch its probe into Trump. According to House Republicans, the questionable document was used by Obama administration officials to obtain a FISA warrant to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, who briefly served as a volunteer foreign policy adviser to Trump’s campaign.Isokoff and Corn write that for their book they “conducted more than 100 interviews with Obama administration officials, Trump administration officials, past and present members of the U.S. intelligence community, key players in the Trump and Clinton campaigns, Trump business associates, cybersecurity experts, and many others.”The book documents Steele told Simpson that he believed the claims that he uncovered about Trump represented a “grave national security threat” that needed to be reported to the FBI. Simpson eventually allowed Steele to report the dossier’s claims to the FBI, the book reports.Steele sought out Rome-based FBI Special Agent Michael Gaeta, with whom he had worked on a previous case. Before Gaeta met with Steele on July 5, 2016, the book relates that the FBI first secured the support of Nuland, who at the time was assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs specializing in Russia.Nuland currently serves as chief executive officer at the Center for a New American Security.Regarding the arrangements for Steele’s initial meeting with the FBI about the dossier claims, Isikoff and Corn report:There were a few hoops Gaeta had to jump through. He was assigned to the U.S. embassy in Rome. The FBI checked with Victoria Nuland’s office at the State Department: Do you support this meeting? Nuland, having found Steele’s reports on Ukraine to have been generally credible, gave the green light.Within a few days, on July 5, Gaeta arrived and headed to Steele’s office near Victoria station. Steele handed him a copy of the report. Gaeta, a seasoned FBI agent, started to read. He turned white. For a while, Gaeta said nothing. Then he remarked, “I have to report this to headquarters.”The book documents that Nuland previously received Steele’s reports on the Ukrainian crisis and had been familiar with Steele’s general work.Nuland did not return a Breitbart News request for comment. She previously served as chief of staff to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott under Bill Clinton’s administration, and then served as deputy director for former Soviet Union affairs.Nuland faced confirmation questions prior to her most recent appointment as assistant secretary of state over her reported role in revising controversial Obama administration talking points about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks. Her reported changes sought to protect Hillary Clinton’s State Department from accusations that it failed to adequately secure the woefully unprotected U.S. Special Mission in Benghazi.Nuland’s name surfaced in a recent flurry of news media reports about the dossier and Kerry’s State Department.The extensive New Yorker profile of Steele published earlier this month named a third former official from Kerry’s State Department for alleged involvement in circulating the dossier. The magazine reported that Kerry’s chief of staff at the State Department, John Finer, obtained the contents of a two-page summary of the dossier and eventually decided to share the questionable document with Kerry.Finer received the dossier summary from Jonathan M. Winer, the Obama State Department official who acknowledged regularly interfacing and exchanging information with Steele, according to the report. Winer previously conceded that he shared the dossier summary with Nuland.After his name surfaced in news media reports related to probes by House Republicans into the dossier, Winer authored a Washington Post oped in which he conceded that while he was working at the State Department he exchanged documents and information with Steele.Winer further acknowledged that while at the State Department, he shared anti-Trump material with Steele passed to him by longtime Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal, whom Winer described as an “old friend.” Winer wrote that the material from Blumenthal – which Winer in turn gave to Steele – originated with Cody Shearer, who is a controversial figure long tied to various Clinton scandals.Aaron Klein is Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average swung between small gains and losses for most of the day. But the market turned decidedly negative in the final hour of trading as losses accelerated and gainers pulled off the road altogether.The Dow was down 345 points, or 1.4 percent, after earlier gaining 243 points. The S&P 500 clocked in a 1.7 percent loss. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell by 2.9 percent.The S&P 500’s tech sector was the dog of the day, suffering a 3.4 percent loss, the worst of the index’s 11 major segments. The problems of Nvidia, which announced today that it was halting tests of self-driving cars, pushed that stock down 9.4 percent. Shares of Facebook fell 5.2 percent and are down 15 percent for the month. Mark Zuckerberg: call your Congressman. Or Senator. They’re calling you.Another weight on tech: possible China tariffs. The U.S. government is set to announce what Chinese products will be subject to the $60 billion or so of new tariffs sometime real soon, according to White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders. While these are aimed at protecting U.S. technology from China’s predatory practices, not a few investors fear that China will respond with its own sanctions against major U.S. tech firms. If China takes aim at Apple, Google, and Netflix, that probably will be short-term bad news for their stocks.Big bank shares also sold off. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index of large banks fell 2.8 percent. The fingers that point accusingly were pointed at the bond market, where yields on longer-term Treasuries were falling. That’s supposedly bad for bank earnings. Bank of America’s shares fell 3.3 percent.Shares of General Electric defied the market gravity, rising by 4.27 percent Tuesday. There was not any actual good news boosting GE’s prospects. If anything, GE could well find itself on the wrong side of China trade war. But there were lots rumors that a big investors whose name rhymes with Boring Muppet might be buying a piece of GE or at least a few shares. And on a day when there was nothing else going right, buying the rumor probably made sense. Especially if you were a few cocktails in.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

She added that the question has “provided data that’s necessary for the Department of Justice to protect voters and specifically to help us better comply with the Voting Rights Act.”The Department of Commerce reinstated the question and on Tuesday Sanders said the department felt strongly about the decision.Yet another reporter brought up critics’ claims that the census would be used against “immigrants,” even to target them.“I would argue that this has been practice of the United States government. The purpose is to determine individuals that are here,” replied Sanders.Pressed on the issue, Sanders again emphasized, “I think that it is going to determine the individuals in our country and provide information that allows us to comply with our own laws and with our own procedures.”Reporters continued to press the issue and were met with repeated comment from Sanders that the Commerce Department found the question important to include on the 2020 census, as it has been in many years past.Another reporter pointed to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, identifying the secretary’s work while in business school on the 1960 census when the reporter said that the citizenship question was included. “Is this his idea to revive it after 22 years or did that originate in the White House,” the reporter asked.Sanders said that the question was “something that the Department of Commerce overseas, but it also takes into account suggestions and recommendations from the Department of Justice and others. The Department of Justice certainly played a role in this process.”Pressed on White House involvement, she said that the White House supports the decision, but that “the decision was made at the department level.”Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

Lockyer. In light of the refusal, a decision stood which interpreted the Second Amendment as protecting a collective right instead of an individual one.Kozinski dissented from the decision and Larry the Cable Guy is asking Americans to read the dissent:History, History, History! Learn from it. RT @PoliticalShort: Those wanting to repeal the Second Amendment should read Judge Kozinski’s Dissenting Opinion in Silveira v. Lockyer https://t.co/CgjhjNoSxl pic.twitter.com/AzsMRoCORK— Larry The Cable Guy (@GitRDoneLarry) March 27, 2018Here are excerpts from Kozinski’s dissent:But the simple truth—born of experience—is that tyranny thrives best where government need not fear the wrath of an armed
people. Our own sorry history bears this out: Disarmament was the tool of choice for subjugating both slaves and free blacks in the South. In Florida, patrols searched blacks’ homes for weapons, confiscated those found and punished
their owners without judicial process. …In the North, by contrast, blacks exercised their right to bear arms to defend against racial mob violence.…All too many of the other great tragedies of history—Stalin’s atrocities, the killing fields of Cambodia, the Holocaust, to name but a few—were perpetrated by armed troops against unarmed populations. Many could well have been avoided or mitigated, had the perpetrators known their intended victims were equipped with a rifle and twenty bullets
apiece, as the Militia Act required here. …If a few hundred Jewish fighters in the Warsaw Ghetto could hold off the Wehrmacht for almost a month with only a handful of weapons, six million Jews armed with rifles could not so easily have been herded into cattle cars.…My excellent colleagues have forgotten these bitter lessons of history. The prospect of tyranny may not grab the headlines the way vivid stories of gun crime routinely do. But few saw the Third Reich coming until it was too late. The Second Amendment is a doomsday provision, one designed for those exceptionally rare circumstances where all other rights have failed—where the government refuses to stand for reelection and silences those who protest; where courts have lost the courage to oppose, or can find no one to enforce their decrees. However improbable these contingencies may seem today, facing them unprepared is a mistake a free people get to make only once.Kozinski observed, “Fortunately, the Framers were wise enough to entrench the right of the people to keep and bear arms within our constitutional structure. The purpose and importance of that right was still fresh in their minds, and they spelled it out clearly so it would not be forgotten.” He noted that when the “people themselves” read the Second Amendment, they can understand the meaning “plainly enough.”AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

This is included in the first section of the commission’s 1934 founding statute.Pai announced that the FCC will vote in April “on a targeted proposal to prohibit the use of [Universal Service Fund] dollars to purchase equipment or services from any company that poses a national security threat to the integrity of U.S. communications networks or the communications supply chain.”“The changing communications landscape has not only elevated the importance of network security, but also created new challenges,” Pai said before pinpointing the integrity of the supply chain as an example. “Over the past decade, the Executive Branch and Congress have repeatedly stressed the importance of identifying and eliminating vulnerabilities in communications networks and their supply chains.”Pai then singled out the national security concern posed by “certain communications equipment providers” and in particular “certain Chinese communications equipment providers.”The Chairman admitted that the FCC could not tackle the problem on its own, but does play a role. One example he gave was “we have a responsibility to make sure that the money from our Universal Service Fund (USF) programs is not used in a way that undermines our national security.”The USF is an FCC fund and set of policies and programs to implement the principle that “All Americans should have access to communications services.” The principle of universal service was included in the FCC’s founding statute. The fund distributed over $8 billion in 2015.Eighteen Senators and Representatives signed on to a December 2017 letter addressed to the Commissioner to heighten his attention to Chinese espionage and a particular Chinese telecommunications equipment manufacturer named Huawei. The Letter noted “press reports that a major U.S. telecommunications provider will begin selling Huawei consumer products in the United States as early as next year, with little or no modifications to the products.”House and Senate select committees on intelligence released a report in 2013 “detailing Huawei’s ties to the Chinese Communist Party, as well as to Chinese intelligence and security services,” according to the letter. The congressional letter requested that Team Telecom review the relationship between the two entities.Pai responded with his own letter noting changes to the plan specifically addressed in the congressional letter, but nevertheless acknowledging a shared concern over “the security threat that Huawei and other Chinese technology companies pose to our communications networks.” He cited a November 2010 congressional letter to the then FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski that also addressed the issue and specifically Huawei and ZTE. Pai ensured that the “FCC does not purchase or use Huawei or ZTE products or equipment.”The Intelligence Community briefed Pai on these issues in response to the letter. As a result, Pai intends “to take proactive steps to help insure the integrity of the communications supply chain in the United States in the near future.”President Donald Trump has specifically targeted China for economic aggression. On March 21 Trump announced tariffs on an estimated $50 billion in exports from China. Trump also ordered the Treasury Department to put together restrictions to be imposed on Chinese investments in American companies. This was one of several actions announced aimed at mitigating China’s “unfair trade practices.”Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

It explicitly prohibited any of its employees, including police, from sharing information on illegal aliens’ with federal authorities. In relevant part it reads:No Agent or Agency shall disclose information regarding the Citizenship or immigration status of any person unless required to do so pursuant to Florida Statutes; Federal Law; the City of West Palm Beach Code of Ordinances; other binding court decisions, opinions, or processes[.]Meanwhile, 8 U.S.C. § 1373 states that jurisdictions “may not prohibit, or in any way restrict, any government entity or official from sending to, or receiving from, [federal immigration officials] information regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual.” Compliance with § 1373 is specifically required to be eligible to receive Bryne grants and forms the basis of one of Sessions’s main strategies for reining in “sanctuary cities.”The affront to federal law was serious enough that West Palm Beach was included in Sessions’s second round of letters to potential sanctuary cities last November, demanding they show compliance with § 1373 or lose their Bryne grants, and then threatening to issue subpoenas if that documentation was not forthcoming.West Palm Beach’s response was to sue Sessions and the Department of Justice claiming it was in compliance with § 1373 despite their “welcoming” resolution and that, in any event, it was unconstitutional to condition federal money on the city proving it followed federal immigration law. At the time, DOJ spokesman Ian Prior said in a statement:The City of West Palm Beach previously agreed to comply with Section 1373—a law that promotes cooperation between local and federal law enforcement—when it accepted FY2016 Byrne JAG funds during the previous administration. Despite the City’s commitment and the fact that the grant condition has already withstood a legal challenge, the City has now sued the Trump Administration for attempting to determine if the City has honored its promise to uphold the rule of law and protect its citizens by sharing information with federal immigration authorities about illegal aliens in the City’s custody because they committed crimes, and that it intends to release back into the community.On Tuesday, the city dropped that lawsuit and West Palm Beach City Attorney Kimberly Rothenburg issued a memo offering “interpretative guidance” that all but abrogates the resolution’s restrictions as they apply to the federal government:All personnel are reminded that you may share—and it is consistent with City Resolution 112-17 and federal law to share—with federal authorities, including the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, any and all information, including information regarding citizenship and immigration status, to which you have access or knowledge as a result of the performance of your job duties for the City of West Palm Beach, regarding any individual.An administration official saw this as a clear victory and potentially a warning to arch-sanctuary jurisdiction California with whom DOJ is now embroiled in litigation, saying in a statement:Since the Trump Administration sued California for their sanctuary policies, California jurisdictions are tripping over themselves to create distance from Governor Brown’s dangerous policies, and now West Palm Beach is instructing its employees to cooperate with ICE in order to avoid a loss in the courts. It is clear that the American people support the administration’s push to protect the public from cities and states that seek to put illegal aliens who have committed crimes back on our streets rather than in the custody of federal immigration authorities.Mayor Muoio, however, told Breitbart News she also saw the settlement as “a big win for West Palm Beach.” “This settlement just reiterates what we already said in our resolution – that we would obey state and federal law … we’re proud to be a welcoming city and we see this as a big win,” she explained.Muoio insisted she did not foresee any change in practices on the ground in West Palm Beach and that, despite the broadly permissive language in Tuesday’s memo, she saw no conflict between it and the text of the welcoming city resolution. “It was our intention always that, if required to do so, we would share information,” she told Breitbart News. “We are not collecting information, that’s not our job, but if we have information and the federal government wants access to that, we’ll of course give that to them.”MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

These [Kurdish] people liberated Raqqa, and a month later they were paid by Turkey coming into their homeland and taking it over with religious extremist rebels who want to establish [their own] religious [system].Some activists say that members of ISIS and al-Qaeda have infiltrated the ranks of the Syrian rebels fighting alongside Turkey, taking advantage of the offensive against the Kurds in Afrin to target Christians and Yazidis.Ishaak, who has voiced support for a decentralized Syria that includes an autonomous Kurdish region, declared:We need to support those [Kurdish] political forces … who acted to implement religious freedom in the region. In the case of northwestern Syria and Afrin, there was a self-administration that was pluralistic—it was made up of Kurds, Syriacs, and Arabs from the region that have protected the region from ISIS and implemented security which is key for any minority anywhere to be able to survive.The Kurds have already combined three Kurdish-led autonomous areas in northern Syria into an independent federal system.Turkey has indicated that it will invade other Kurdish-held areas in Syria, including Manbij, where the United States maintains a presence. Ankara has also vowed to push the Kurdish PKK out of Iraq’s Yazidi-majority Sinjar region.Former Republican Congressman from Virginia Frank Wolf, a long-time advocate for religious minorities who serves as a distinguished fellow at the pro-religious freedom 21st Century Wilberforce Initiative, stressed that Iran-allied militias sanctioned by Baghdad had prevented Christians from returning to Mosul, rendering the city free of Christians after 2,000 years.“In a few years, no Christians will be left in the cradle of Christianity” Iraq, reiterated Wolf, adding that the population of the religious group has dropped dramatically from about 1.5 million in 2003 to an estimated 250,000 now.“We have seen the Christian population in the Middle East virtually eliminated,” Sam Brownback, the U.S. Ambassador for International Religious Freedom, added at the Heritage event, noting that the Trump administration believes religious freedom “is a central issue of the day and we will fight for it.”Amb. Brownback pointed out that “70 percent” of Christians across the world are suffering from some persecution.The once thriving Jewish population in Iraq has also been nearly eradicated, from 150,000 in 1948 to currently no more than ten, noted Wolf.Ishak from the Syriac National Council is also a member of the political bureau of the Syrian Democratic Council.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

They were ultimately able to obtain backend Facebook data revealing a log of when the account was accessed and the IP addresses corresponding to each login,” the Intercept explained. “Lea Whitis, an agent with Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of ICE, emailed the team a ‘Facebook Business Record’ revealing the suspect’s phone number and the locations of each login into his account during a date range.”In their tracking efforts, ICE also reportedly worked with Palantir, a data analysis company co-founded by libertarian billionaire and Trump-supporter Peter Thiel.“I am going to see if our Palantir guy is here to dump the Western Union info in there since I know there is a way to triangulate the area he’s sending money from and narrow down time of day etc,” wrote one ICE agent in an email leaked to the Intercept.In a statement, a Facebook spokesman denied claims that ICE had any “special data access.”“Facebook does not provide ICE or any other law enforcement agency with any special data access to assist with the enforcement of immigration law. We have strict processes in place to handle these government requests,” the company claimed. “Every request we receive is checked for legal sufficiency. We require officials to provide a detailed description of the legal and factual basis for their request, and we push back when we find legal deficiencies or overly broad or vague demands for information.”“In this case, our records show that ICE sent valid legal process to us in an investigation said to involve an active child predator. We take the enforcement of laws protecting children from child predators very seriously, and we responded to ICE’s valid request with data consistent with our publicly available data disclosure standards,” they concluded. “ICE did not identify any immigration law violations in connection with its data request to Facebook in this case.”Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

The Senate Judiciary Committee urged Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who chairs the committee, to call on Zuckerberg to testify about the recent alleged misuse of 50 million Facebook users’ data. Grassley confirmed that he asked the Facebook CEO to testify at an upcoming hearing relating to data privacy that would examine “the protection and monitoring of consumer data.”The full press release from Grassley’s website reads: The Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, will hold a hearing on data privacy on April 10, 2018.Grassley today invited Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify at the hearing to discuss Facebook’s past and future policies regarding the protection and monitoring of consumer data.The hearing will broadly cover privacy standards for the collection, retention and dissemination of consumer data for commercial use. It will also examine how such data may be misused or improperly transferred and what steps companies like Facebook can take to better protect personal information of users and ensure more transparency in the process.Grassley also invited Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey to discuss the future of data privacy in the social media industry and how to develop “rules of the road” that encourage companies to develop tailored approaches to privacy that satisfy consumer expectations while maintaining incentives for innovation.This is the second group to call on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress. Key congressional lawmakers from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, a group that oversees the actions of companies such as Facebook and Google, requested that Zuckerberg appear before them to testify in a formal hearing recently. The chairman of the committee, Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR) and the committee’s head Democrat representative, Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-NJ), said in a statement:The latest revelations regarding Facebook’s use and security of user data raises many serious consumer protection concern. After committee staff received a briefing yesterday from Facebook officials, we felt that many questions were left unanswered. Mr. Zuckerberg has stated that he would be willing to testify if he is ‘the right person.’We believe, as CEO of Facebook, he is the right witness to provide answers to the American people. We look forward to working with Facebook and Mr. Zuckerberg to determine a date and time in the near future for a hearing before this committee.Facebook is now also facing scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC recently stated that they are investigating the social media companies internal user privacy practices. Tom Pahl, Acting Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, released a statement on their investigation saying:When asked would he be willing to testify before Congress about Facebook’s latest scandal, Zuckerberg stated, “I’m open to doing that. We actually do this fairly regularly … There are lots of different topics that Congress needs and wants to know about, and the way that we approach it is that our responsibility is to make sure that they have access to all of the information that they need to have.” But Zuckerberg did hedge this offer by saying, “the short answer is, I’m happy to if it’s the right thing to do”Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Francis Kalifat, president of the Jewish group CRIF, said Knoll was stabbed 11 times.Two men have been jailed in the case, according to the judicial official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. They face preliminary charges of robbery, damaging property, and murder with anti-Semitic motives, he said.Knoll reportedly escaped a notorious World War II roundup of Paris Jews, in which police herded some 13,000 people — including more than 4,000 children — into a stadium and shipped them to the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi German-occupied Poland. Fewer than 100 survived.Then 9, Knoll fled with her mother to Portugal, returning to France only after the end of the war.Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo called on “all Parisians” to join a silent march Wednesday in memory of Knoll. Politicians across the political spectrum promised to attend.French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that Knoll’s death was a “horrific crime,” and reaffirmed his “absolute determination to fight against anti-Semitism.”The CRIF compared the killing to that of Sarah Halimi, 65, who was beaten and thrown from her balcony last April. That murder was reclassified as anti-Semitic last month. The suspect is in a psychiatric hospital.France’s government presented a plan this month to fight racism and anti-Semitism, focusing on social media and prevention in schools. It also wants to change French law to force internet platforms to detect and remove illegal content.An annual national count of racist, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim and anti-Christian acts — most of which involve threats — dipped in 2017 compared with the year before. But anti-Semitic violence increased by 26 percent, and criminal damage to Jewish places of worship and burial by 22 percent.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

In general, viewers in blue states are much more likely to get an erotic-charge from Stormy, while red state viewers are more likely to find she kills the mood,” the company declared in a press release.In a statement, xHamster Vice President Alex Hawkins claimed, “Stormy Daniels has become an international icon.”“She’s now the most searched for porn star in the world, no matter what your gender or where your politics lie,” he expressed. “She’s a force of nature who is changing the way that the world sees porn stars.”xHamster graphs further revealed the extent of Daniels’ rise to fame this year.From January 1 to March 18 2017, searches for Daniels on xHamster were next to zero.In 2018, however, porn searches for Daniels have been on a sharp rise, reaching 2,000 percent in mid-January, and rising to 15,000 percent in mid-March.During every publicity stunt and news item surrounding her alleged sexual escapades with President Trump, Daniels’ popularity in porn searches have also continued to elevate.Thank you, @StormyDaniels for being the #1 Search Term on xHamster in 2018!

Israel is the only country to have such an agenda.U.S. Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley slammed the UNHRC for the anti-Israel resolutions, saying the council was “foolish and unworthy of its name.” At the same time, Israel blasted the UN agency for being a “sham” run by “bloodthirsty dictatorships.”The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, welcomed the new motions, with spokesperson Yusuf al-Mahmoud thanking those who voted in favor “for their ability to stand in the face of injustice, arrogance and occupation and to reject the language of threats and coercion.”The resolutions, he said, “reflect an international position in favor of a just and fitting solution to the conflict.”In 2014, the Palestinians applied for membership to 15 international treaties, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Fourth Geneva Convention and the UN Convention Against Corruption and were accepted by then Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to ten treaties as non-state members.MOST POPULARFROM THE HOMEPAGE"

In the north, it’s backward. If we compare the strip of land in the north, it is 900 kilometers and some 244,000 residents. There, we invested only 970 shekels [$280] per resident.”In order to bolster protection in the north, Liberman said, a five-year plan with a minimum investment of a billion shekels per year must be formulated.“I am not pointing any fingers; this is the reality. The entire cabinet bears responsibility,” he said.Liberman also urged Israelis to keep calm as news that Hamas is planning what they’re calling a million man march to storm the border fence between Israel and Gaza this Friday, coinciding with both Passover eve and Palestinian Land Day, which marks events in 1976 that reflect the Palestinians’ struggle to own the land.“Our advice to everyone is not to panic,” he said. “Everything can be handled with composure. We are prepared for every eventuality, and we are boosting our presence.”Palestinians from Gaza have been urged to set up “tent cities” close to the border and to remain there until what they call Nakba Day – the day of “catastrophe” that marks the establishment of the State of Israel.Security cabinet officials on Sunday were briefed on how best to deal with erupting protests and violence that may ensue in the coming weeks ahead of Israel’s 70th Independence Day.

Heller (2008). He believes the right to keep and bear arms is collective, rather than individual.This same disagreement fueled his March 27, 2018, New York Times‘ op-ed calling for an all-out repeal of the Second Amendment. His claims the Heller decision “provided the NRA with a propaganda weapon of immense power,” and that a repeal of the Second Amendment would render the Heller decision moot, thereby eliminating the NRA’s sway over lawmakers.He contends repealing the Second Amendment “would make our schoolchildren safer than they have been since 2008,” but does not address the fact that some of our most heinous firearm-based attacks occurred years before the Heller decision was handed down. For example, thirteen students were shot and killed in the April 20, 1999, Columbine attack and 32 were shot and killed in the April 16, 2007, attack on Virginia Tech’s gun-free campus.AWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News, the host of the Breitbart podcast Bullets with AWR Hawkins, and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

"Breitbart","http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2018/03/27/nolte-trump-poll-bump-msm-regretting-cnn-ization-news/","Let’s face it — our elitist media had a very bad weekend. To fully delight in just how demoralized they all are today, we must first imagine their gleeful sense anticipation on Friday afternoon —  like spoiled children on the day of their birthday party thinking only of ponies: “Stock market dives on Friday – yay! Anti-gun march Saturday – yessss! Stormy arrives Sunday – squeeel!! New polls on Trump’s job approval numbers Monday – whoo-hoo!”And then…Ker-splat.Saturday’s attendance at the anti-gun march was, to say the least, quite underwhelming, especially when you consider all the energy our unbiased, objective media spent advertising it. The fallout from the march was even worse.On Sunday, the super-hyped 60 Minutes interview with Stormy Daniels fizzled, landed with such a dud that is all anyone talked about Monday. The 21 million viewers might have delivered the newsmagazine its best night in a decade, but it was still way less than half of the 49 million who tuned in to see Monica Lewinsky’s 1999 interview.Also on Monday came a huge bump for Trump’s job approval rating and…A near-record day for the stock market.To add insult to injury, last week, between the media’s porn-porn-porn-gungrab-gungrab-gungrab, they told us that President McStupidCrazyRacist had just launched a disastrous trade war and the apocalypse what nigh.And then this and this happened.Oh, and all the polls taken during the Stormy-era show the Republican Party in much better shape to house the House.Oops.The CNN-ization of the entire news media, this Zucker-ification against Trump that focuses only on nonsense and left-wing activism, has failed so hard, some within the media are actually wondering if the media should not focus more, say, issues the public actually cares about.Amy Walter of the Cook Report tweeted Tuesday, “One reason why media gets low ratings: non-stop coverage of Stormy Daniels, little to none on top issue for Americans – health care/p. drug cost and access. Which one do you think matters more to their day to day lives?”One reason why media gets low ratings: non-stop coverage of Stormy Daniels, little to none on top issue for Americans – health care/p. drug cost and access.

Lots of people watching, but is anyone surprised at all about the salacious details alleged? And less talk about actual policy vulnerabilities,” he tweeted.This is my contrarian side speaking, but wonder if all this Stormy Daniels talk HELPS Republicans — contrary to the CW of this week.Lots of people watching, but is anyone surprised at all about the salacious details alleged?  And less talk about actual policy vulnerabilities. https://t.co/tjAXLcs486— Josh Kraushaar (@HotlineJosh) March 27, 2018Even the far-left Hollywood Reporter published a long lament.The other night, I succumbed to temptation. I lapped up every second of 60 Minutes’ Stormy Daniels interview, just like 20 million Americans and countless others around the world. My only regret was that there wasn’t more, which might explain why the ratings dropped off so precipitously. Once Daniels had made her exit, who needed to keep watching? The show started with a climax, so to speak, and went down from there.I left the program feeling deflated. But it wasn’t because the interview disappointed. It was because I’d bought into the argument that it mattered in the first place, that everything to do with Daniels is Real News.Real News is what’s going on in Syria and Yemen and Saudi Arabia and Iran. Real News is the hundreds of thousands of students who demonstrated in favor of gun control. Real News is the horror that 700,000-plus DACA kids may face if the government deports them. Real News is a budget that was just passed, with such token coverage by the broadcast media that I couldn’t even tell you what was in it.Behind the scenes in MediaBubbleLand, there is no doubt that many Media Provincials are privately licking wounds and wondering the same.But does anyone think we would see all this second guessing and sudden concern over The Issues That Matter To The American People if this weekend had not spectacularly backfired, had Trump’s approval rating done what the far-left CNN was expecting — dropped seven points to 28 percent as opposed to climbing eight points to 43 percent?Our disgraced media seem to have forgotten four things…1) The impossible-to-shame media’s partisan hypocrisy on the issue of personal matters. Former-President Bill Clinton was all about extra-marital affairs, even while president in the Oval Office. The media protected him, and protected him even more when he was credibly accused of harassment (Paula Jones won a judgment and $850,000), groping (by a Democrat), and even rape.But now the media are freaking out because a man who has never presented himself as our moral savior might have had two consensual affairs 12  freakin’ years ago?Please.2) When the Republican Party went hard after Clinton over his private life, his job approval numbers also improved. The public does not like what they see as politically-motivated moral witch hunts.3) It’s the economy, you stupes. While the media try to create a moral panic over something as dumb as a consensual boink 12 years ago, as the media’s wild-eyed conspiracy theories about Russian collusion collapse into a pile of Obama/FBI scandals, Trump has kept his eye on the ball, has done his job, and now his economy has inspired confidence, real job growth, and economic growth.4) CNN is a last-place ratings catastrophe and a national laughingstock. Why would any sane news outlet follow the lead of a proven failure?The good news is that there is no coming back for the media. As a moral authority, as a swayer of public opinion, the institution is deceased through an act of credibility-suicide.Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
