"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/trump-school-shooter-florida.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump asserted Monday that he would have rushed in to save the students and teachers of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School from a gunman with an assault weapon, even if he was unarmed at the time of the massacre.Speaking to a meeting of the country’s governors at the White House, Mr. Trump conceded that “you don’t know until you test it.” But he said he believed he would have exhibited bravery “even if I didn’t have a weapon, and I think most of the people in this room would have done that, too.”The president’s remarks came during an hourlong televised conversation with the governors in the State Dining Room, during which Mr. Trump continued to grapple publicly with how best to respond to the mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., discussing such things as arming teachers and reopening mental institutions.As Mr. Trump skipped from one possible solution to another, he mused about the “old days,” when potential criminals could be locked in mental hospitals, and he vowed to ban “bump stocks,” an accessory that can make a semiautomatic weapon fire rapidly, more like an automatic rifle. But he dropped any mention of raising the age required to purchase a rifle to 21 from 18, something he said last week he supported, despite opposition from the National Rifle Association.But the president continued his dayslong verbal assault on Florida sheriff’s deputies, calling their reported failure to respond to the Parkland school massacre, which killed 17 staff members and students, “disgusting” and “a disgrace.” He said the deputies “weren’t exactly Medal of Honor winners, all right.”A lawyer for Deputy Scot Peterson of the Broward County Sheriff’s Office said Monday in a statement that Mr. Peterson did not run into the school when the shooting began because he thought the shots were coming from the outside. Mr. Peterson retired Thursday after Sheriff Scott Israel branded him “a coward” for failing to run into the building to try to save students.Mr. Trump echoed that sentiment, saying that the performance of Mr. Peterson and three other deputies whose actions have been questioned “was, frankly, disgusting.”Later, he added that “the way they performed was really a disgrace.”As lawmakers returned to Washington after a weeklong break, the president used the White House forum on Monday to insist that politicians do something quickly to ensure that shootings like the one in Florida will never happen again.The politics of guns for Republicans continue to be difficult.Georgia’s lieutenant governor, Casey Cagle, a conservative Republican, said on Monday that he would block any tax break for his state’s largest employer, Delta Air Lines, if the company does not reinstate discounts for N.R.A. members that it suspended after the shooting. And Mr. Trump — who said he had lunch Sunday with N.R.A. leaders — publicly clashed with Washington State’s Democratic governor about the benefits of giving guns to some teachers.Mr. Trump said again that he supports a bill to strengthen the system of background checks made during some gun purchases. That legislation is sponsored by Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate who said on Monday that he would move forward with his background-check bill as early as this week.But the two top Republicans in Congress — Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader — have largely been silent on the broader debate about possible changes to gun laws after the Florida shooting.Mr. Trump tried to take the lead.“We have to have action. We don’t have any action,” Mr. Trump complained. “A week goes by, ‘Let’s keep talking.’ Another week goes by, we keep talking. Two months go by — all of the sudden, everybody is off to the next subject. Then, when it happens again, everybody is angry and, ‘Let’s start talking again.’ We got to stop.”Mr. Trump said that was his message during his lunch on Sunday with Wayne LaPierre, the head of the N.R.A., and Chris W. Cox, the group’s top lobbyist. He called the pair “great patriots” and “great people” who want to “do something” quickly to prevent more school shootings.“Don’t worry about the N.R.A. They’re on our side,” the president told the governors. “You guys — half of you are so afraid of the N.R.A. There’s nothing to be afraid of. And you know what? If they’re not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while. That’s O.K.”But even as he chided his predecessors in Washington for their delays and inaction, Mr. Trump’s own preferred solutions remained elusive Monday as he continued what administration officials described as a “listening” phase of the response.“We’re still listening and making and determining the best steps forward,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters after the president’s session with the governors on Monday morning.Mr. Trump lamented a period in history when he said mentally unstable people who had not yet committed a crime could be committed to a mental hospital if it were clear they were acting like a “boiler ready to explode.”“You could nab somebody like this,” Mr. Trump said of the Florida shooting suspect, Nikolas Cruz, citing the scores of warning signs that Mr. Cruz was troubled. “You can’t arrest him, I guess, because he hasn’t done anything.”But he said too many of the governors in the room had closed the mental hospitals that might have been a solution to that problem, often because of how expensive they were.“We have no halfway. We have nothing between a prison and leaving him at his house, which we can’t do anymore,” Mr. Trump told the governors. “So I think you folks have to start thinking about that.”Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington State appeared to annoy Mr. Trump during a testy exchange about the president’s proposal to protect students by allowing trained teachers to carry concealed weapons in schools.“It would just be a very small group of people that are very gun adept,” Mr. Trump told the governor.Mr. Inslee responded that giving guns to any number of teachers, coaches or administrators in the schools would be wrong, and he urged the president to abandon the idea.“I’ve listened to the first-grade teachers that don’t want to be pistol-packing first-grade teachers,” Mr. Inslee said as the president frowned and folded his arms across his chest. “I just suggest we need a little less tweeting here and a little more listening. And let’s just take that off the table and move forward.”Mr. Trump did not acknowledge the criticism and moved quickly to remarks from Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican.In a separate meeting with the spouses of the governors, the first lady, Melania Trump, gave brief remarks that also touched on the shooting at the Florida high school. She praised the students from the school who have been demanding action from politicians.“I have been heartened to see children across this country using their voices to speak out and try to create change,” Mrs. Trump said. “They’re our future and they deserve a voice.”Ms. Sanders said later that the president also supported the students who had been protesting, even though he opposes the ban on assault weapons that many of them have been calling for.“That’s the reason why he had a number of them here at the White House just last week,” Ms. Sanders said. “It is one that is very important and should be listened to. We want to continue that dialogue as well as continue the conversations with state, local and federal officials.”The governors came away impressed by Mr. Trump’s resolve to address the issue, according to Gov. Brian Sandoval of Nevada, a Republican and chairman of the National Governors Association.Noting that he leads the state that last year endured the deadliest mass shooting in American history, Mr. Sandoval added that the governors shared the urgency. “There’s a consensus that something needs to be done.”But there was no consensus about Mr. Trump’s idea of arming trained teachers or other school personnel. “I have three kids,” said Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana, a Democrat and the vice chairman of the association. “I don’t want my teachers armed. I don’t think most Americans do.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/melania-trump-inauguration-adviser.html","WASHINGTON — The first lady, Melania Trump, has parted ways with an adviser after news about the adviser’s firm reaping $26 million in payments to help plan President Trump’s inauguration.Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who has been friends with Mrs. Trump for years, had been working on a contract basis as an unpaid senior adviser to the office of the first lady.Stephanie Grisham, Mrs. Trump’s spokeswoman, said the office had “severed the gratuitous services contract with Ms. Wolkoff,” who Ms. Grisham said had been employed as “a special government employee” to work on specific projects. “We thank her for her hard work and wish her all the best.”The contract was terminated last week, according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation.They said the move was prompted by displeasure from the Trumps over the news, first reported by The New York Times, that a firm created by Ms. Winston Wolkoff was paid nearly $26 million for event planning by a nonprofit group that oversaw Mr. Trump’s inauguration and surrounding events in January 2017.Mr. Trump, who is notoriously tight with money, was also enraged to learn that Ms. Winston Wolkoff brought on an associate, David Monn, to help plan inaugural events, according to people who spoke to him. Mr. Monn’s firm was paid $3.7 million, according to a tax filing by the nonprofit group, the 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee.Ms. Grisham said that the first lady “had no involvement” with the inaugural committee and that she “had no knowledge of how funds were spent.”Ms. Winston Wolkoff, in an email, defended her work on the inauguration, denounced news coverage of it and challenged the characterization that her contract with Mrs. Trump’s office was terminated as a result of the news about payments from the inaugural committee.“I was informed by the White House counsel’s office that all gratuitous volunteer contracts were ended,” she said.She asserted that the development would not affect her relationship with Mrs. Trump, who attended Ms. Winston Wolkoff’s 40th birthday party in 2010 and has traveled in the same circles for years.“I expect to remain a trusted source for advice and support on an informal basis,” she wrote.In another email, Ms. Winston Wolkoff said, “I am proud of the work that we did to support the inauguration.”She said her firm, WIS Media Partners, spent the overwhelming majority of the money it was paid by the inaugural committee on services to subcontractors, including for satellite feeds to be provided to broadcasters worldwide.The firm “retained a total of $1.62 million for all of its consulting and creative services, which was divided among our staff of 15 members (including myself),” she said in the email. She added that the firm, which had been created only weeks before the inauguration, “submitted all of our records fully audited to the inauguration committee nearly one full year ago in March 2017.”Ms. Winston Wolkoff said news coverage of her work was “completely unfair,” but she did not specify any errors. In a series of emails, she copied a lawyer from the New York-based law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and wrote, “There have been a number of unfair and untrue statements about me and I am reserving all rights.”Ms. Winston Wolkoff made her name planning society galas in New York, including the Costume Institute Gala, also known as the Met Gala, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Over the years, she worked closely on the gala with the Vogue editor Anna Wintour. Mr. Monn also worked on the gala, which embodies an exclusive vibe that is in many ways incongruous with the messaging to blue-collar voters that Mr. Trump projected during the 2016 presidential campaign.That discordance attracted notice when Ms. Winston Wolkoff was retained by the inaugural committee, which was led by the California real estate investor Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s.Mrs. Trump had introduced Ms. Winston Wolkoff to Mr. Barrack, according to a person familiar with the connection. But the decision to hire Ms. Winston Wolkoff was Mr. Barrack’s, said an operative who worked with the inaugural committee.Ms. Winston Wolkoff often invoked her friendship with Mrs. Trump when talking with officials on the Trump transition team and then in the East Wing, according to three people with direct knowledge of her interactions.The inaugural committee promised that the swearing-in ceremonies and events would be “workmanlike,” even as it raised a record-shattering $107 million — about twice as much as former President Barack Obama’s inaugural committee raised for the festivities around his 2009 swearing-in — largely from wealthy donors and corporations.The majority of those funds — more than $57 million — went to four event-planning companies. The company that received the biggest payment was Ms. Winston Wolkoff’s firm, which was incorporated in California in December 2016 — about six weeks before the inauguration.The operative who worked with the inaugural committee said that Ms. Winston Wolkoff’s firm handled everything from securing venues and table settings to arranging Instagram filters and satellite feeds, as well as the transportation of heavy equipment.An inaugural committee official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the details publicly, said Ms. Winston Wolkoff’s firm also paid the team used by Mark Burnett, the creator of “The Apprentice,” whose involvement in the inaugural festivities was requested by Mr. Trump.Mr. Barrack had praised Ms. Winston Wolkoff, saying that she “executed her duties well.”Mr. Monn’s $3.7 million payment from the inaugural committee was primarily to plan two events, one of which was billed as a “candlelight dinner” attended by Mr. and Mrs. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, according to the operative who worked with the committee.Mr. Monn, who had planned a state dinner for Mr. Obama’s White House, said he was “flattered” and “honored” when Ms. Winston Wolkoff asked him to help with the inauguration. He said he “received some very unpleasant comments” from people when his work on the inauguration was made public, but he said: “I actually consider myself a patriot. I am not a politician.”Ms. Winston Wolkoff said Mr. Monn “is an exceptional event planner who is universally respected for his design and décor expertise.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-daca-dreamers.html","WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday declined an unusual White House request that it immediately decide whether the Trump administration can shut down a program that shields some 700,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation. The move meant that the immigrants, often called “Dreamers,” could remain in legal limbo for many months unless Congress acts to make their status permanent.The Supreme Court’s decision not to hear the administration’s appeal was expected, as no appeals court has yet ruled on the issue. The court’s order was brief, gave no reasons and noted no dissents. It said it expected the appeals court to “proceed expeditiously to decide this case.”President Trump ended the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, last September, calling it an unconstitutional use of executive power by his predecessor and reviving the threat of deportation for immigrants who had been brought to the United States illegally as young children.But two federal judges have ordered the administration to maintain major pieces of the program while legal challenges move forward, notably by requiring the administration to allow people enrolled in it to renew their protected status. The administration has not sought stays of those injunctions. The Supreme Court’s move will, as a practical matter, temporarily shield the young immigrants who already had signed up for the DACA program from immediate deportation, and allow them to keep working legally in the United States. Their status lasts for two years and is renewable.The court’s decision not to hear the appeal could also relieve the immediate political pressure on lawmakers to permanently address the status of those immigrants, or to deal with the additional one million Dreamers who had never signed up for the DACA program. They remain at risk of deportation if immigration agents find them.Even as he ended the DACA program, Mr. Trump had called upon Congress to give the young immigrants legal status — and an eventual path to citizenship — before the program was scheduled to expire March 5.But that proposal has been bogged down in partisan gridlock as members of Congress argue about broader changes to the United States’ immigration system that the president and his conservative allies in Congress have demanded as part of any deal to address the future of the young immigrants.This month, senators failed to reach consensus in a series of votes on bills to address the Dreamers and other immigration issues. A bipartisan coalition in the Senate roundly rejected a measure backed by Mr. Trump that would have all but ended the family-based migration system that has been in place for decades. A separate bipartisan measure that would have legalized the Dreamers and allocated $25 billion for a wall on the border with Mexico fell six votes short of the 60 needed to proceed to a final vote.Now, the court’s action is likely to lessen the urgency on Capitol Hill over the issue, making it even more probable that Congress will take no action as the legal process plays out.As a possible fallback plan after the Senate’s failure this month, lawmakers could negotiate a short-term patch that would continue the DACA program for a few years, perhaps in exchange for partial funding of Mr. Trump’s wall. Such a deal could be tucked into a broad spending bill that lawmakers must approve by March 23, when government funding is set to expire.But the court’s move could undercut any momentum to push for even a very narrow deal in the next few weeks, and there has been little evidence of progress toward any kind of bipartisan pact that would be acceptable to Mr. Trump. House Republican leaders still appear focused on a hard-line conservative immigration bill that would be a nonstarter in the Senate.“While the court’s decision appears to have pushed this deadline beyond March, House Republicans are actively working toward a solution,” said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.Mr. Trump has repeatedly condemned Democrats in recent days, accusing them of not caring about the young immigrants. In one recent Twitter post, he said Republicans “stand ready to make a deal” to protect the Dreamers from deportation.But Democrats, and some Republicans, accuse Mr. Trump and his hard-line conservative White House advisers of using the Dreamers as leverage for changes to the immigration system that conservative, anti-immigrant activists have long sought.The case at the Supreme Court was brought in California by five sets of plaintiffs. They included four states — California, Maine, Maryland and Minnesota — and Janet Napolitano, the president of the University of California. As secretary of homeland security in the Obama administration, Ms. Napolitano signed the document that established the program in 2012.In January, Judge William H. Alsup of the Federal District Court in San Francisco ruled that the administration had abused its discretion and had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in rescinding the program. Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis of the Federal District Court in Brooklyn issued a similar ruling this month.The judges acknowledged that presidents have broad powers to alter the policies of earlier administrations. But they said the Trump administration’s justifications for rescinding the program did not withstand scrutiny.The administration had argued that the program was an unconstitutional exercise of authority by the executive branch, relying on a ruling from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, concerning a related program. The Supreme Court deadlocked, 4 to 4, in an appeal of that ruling.The judges said the two programs differed in important ways, undermining the administration’s legal analysis. They noted, too, that Mr. Trump had issued conflicting statements about the DACA program.Both judges issued nationwide injunctions ordering the administration to retain major elements of the program while the cases moved forward. Such nationwide injunctions from judges in individual cases, which have been used to block executive actions in both the Obama and Trump administrations, have been the subject of much commentary and criticism.The administration appealed Judge Alsup’s ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, and that court put the appeal on a fast track. In an unusual move, the administration also asked the Supreme Court to grant immediate review, leapfrogging the appeals court.That procedure, called “certiorari before judgment,” is used rarely, typically in cases involving national crises like President Harry S. Truman’s seizure of the steel industry and President Richard M. Nixon’s refusal to turn over tape recordings to a special prosecutor.In a statement, the Justice Department said it would continue to make its legal arguments as the case proceeded.“While we were hopeful for a different outcome, the Supreme Court very rarely grants certiorari before judgment, though in our view, it was warranted for the extraordinary injunction requiring the Department of Homeland Security to maintain DACA,” said Devin M. O’Malley, a spokesman for the department. “We will continue to defend D.H.S.’s lawful authority to wind down DACA in an orderly manner.”Lawyers for the challengers expressed satisfaction with Monday’s developments.“We are pleased that the Supreme Court is allowing the normal appellate process to run its course,” said Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., who represents people affected by the program. “DACA is a lawful and important program that protects young people who came to this country as children and who know this country as their only home.”In a brief urging the Supreme Court to deny review, lawyers for the University of California wrote that “it has been nearly 30 years since the court granted certiorari before judgment without the benefit of a court of appeals ruling on the question presented.”In a second brief, lawyers for the four states wrote that no national emergency warranted use of the unusual procedure.“Since 2012, the DACA program has allowed hundreds of thousands of young people to receive deferred action, work authorization and other benefits,” they wrote. “The district court’s preliminary injunction only partially and temporarily restores the situation that existed prior to petitioners’ abrupt decision to terminate the program — and only for individuals who had already received deferred action under DACA.”“Petitioners are entitled to a prompt appeal,” the brief said, “but there is no imminent deadline posing a critical threat to the public interest of the sort that might justify bypassing the normal channels for that review.”In the administration’s brief, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco told the justices that “an ongoing violation of federal law being committed by nearly 700,000 aliens” required the Supreme Court to act. But he did not ask the court to stay Judge Alsup’s injunction while the case moved forward. Mr. Francisco wrote that an immediate stay would interfere with the administration’s goal of an “orderly wind-down” of the program.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/us/politics/gun-control-congress-governors.html","WASHINGTON — Lawmakers will return to Washington on Monday facing intense public pressure to break their decades-long gridlock on gun control, a demand fortified by a bipartisan group of governors calling for Congress to take action to protect against mass shootings.But even as members of both parties said it might be difficult for Congress to remain on the sidelines after the school massacre this month in Parkland, Fla., lawmakers have no clear consensus on even incremental changes to gun restrictions, let alone more sweeping legislation.Over a weeklong recess, Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate remained largely silent on gun legislation, a reflection of the significant obstacles to passing even modest measures this year.Many Republicans fear primary challenges from the right in the midterm elections this fall and do not want to be pushed into difficult votes. Democrats are not eager for legislation that they deem too incremental. And with lawmakers of both parties looking to wrap up their work to focus on their campaigns for re-election, the time to pass any significant legislation is running short.If the past is prologue, Congress will do nothing.But governors who gathered in Washington for their annual winter meeting warned of the perils of inaction. Animated by a wave of polling since the Florida massacre, Democratic governors warned that candidates would pay a political price for opposing new gun regulations, and some of their Republican counterparts conceded that the pleas of voters could no longer be ignored as they increasingly abandon the party.“I think for Republicans our challenge in the next race is going to be about appealing to the suburban vote that hasn’t been so good for Republicans the last few races,” said Gov. Bill Haslam of Tennessee, citing in particular suburban women. It is clear, he added, that “people want to see action.”The combination of political pressure from the governors and moves by President Trump to embrace certain limited measures opposed by the National Rifle Association could set up a congressional showdown with the powerful firearms lobby not seen since the gun debate that followed the deadly school shooting in 2012 in Newtown, Conn.The sudden focus on guns is likely to complicate an already busy agenda. Congress left Washington without coming up with a replacement for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which protects hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation and expires next week. A contentious debate over gun legislation could push immigration to the back burner.While the Newtown massacre and the many that have followed have produced familiar scenes in which Democrats push for tough new gun restrictions and Republicans dig in and resist, the latest mass shooting appears to have shifted the landscape, even if just slightly, as the Parkland students have become overnight gun control advocates and media fixtures.A smattering of congressional Republicans — including some who have been staunchly opposed to gun control legislation — now suggest that they would be willing to take at least small steps toward restricting gun rights.After being jeered at a forum televised on CNN, Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said last week that he would reconsider his opposition to limiting high-capacity magazines. Another Florida Republican, Representative Brian Mast, an Army veteran who lost both of his legs to a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, called for a ban on the purchase of assault weapons.Gun control advocates are looking toward the changing political climate in Florida, where the Republican governor, Rick Scott, and state lawmakers defied the N.R.A. in proposing to raise to 21 the minimum age to buy any firearm.Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, is teaming up with Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, on legislation that would raise to 21 from 18 the age threshold for purchasing assault weapons like the AR-15 used to kill 17 people in Parkland.A poll released by CNN on Sunday, which showed support for stricter gun laws at levels not seen since the early 1990s, found that 71 percent of Americans backed barring those under 21 from buying any type of firearm.“I don’t know if crossing the Rubicon is the right historical analogy, but there is a sense that this is different,” Mr. Flake said, adding, “Where the public is and where some Republicans have been on some of these issues just doesn’t match, and I do think we’re going to have to deal with it.”Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, a longtime ally of the N.R.A., has said he would back such an age-restriction proposal. “Certainly nobody under 21 should have an AR-15,” he told reporters in Kansas last week.Mr. Flake, however, is not seeking re-election, and Mr. Roberts, 81, is unlikely to run again in 2020.At the governors’ meeting, there was agreement on the issue between Democrats and some Republicans. “We do it for alcohol; we’re talking about raising the age for tobacco to 21,” said Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah, a Republican. “I think that’s worth talking about.”Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said that with such talk among Republicans, “this feels like a watershed moment.”“You’re seeing some significant and meaningful cracks in the bond that traditionally holds the Republican Party together,” he said. “The question is: Are those cracks enough to get something done?”Gun rights advocates said the answer was no. “This, thus far, has shown no different a dynamic than any of a dozen fights over the past two decades,” said Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for Gun Owners of America, which has fought gun control measures for decades. “People who, after a week, suggest that this is a tipping point either weren’t around during previous battles or failed to learn the lesson.”Some Republicans, warning against a rush to enact new laws, appeared inclined to respect the wishes of the N.R.A., even as the group came under pressure from some corporate leaders, who were moving to cut ties with it.“I think there’s a temptation just to do a whole host of things that are not really addressing the fundamental problem but would make people feel better that they’ve done things,” said Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who has deep ties to the N.R.A., explaining his opposition to raising the age limit.Representative Thomas Massie, Republican of Kentucky and the chairman of the Congressional Second Amendment Caucus, warned that Republicans who had run for office on a platform that included protecting gun rights would face political consequences if they changed their tune.“I suspect that a majority of Republicans are not going to turn on their base,” Mr. Massie said.While such sentiment makes it unlikely that lawmakers will consider sweeping new gun restrictions, Congress is considering a number of more modest proposals.In the House, 19 Republicans, led by Representative Leonard Lance of New Jersey, sent a letter on Friday to Speaker Paul D. Ryan, calling on him to schedule a vote on a measure that would require states and federal agencies to do a better job of reporting legal and mental health records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS.But the bill, called the Fix NICS Act, which is backed by the N.R.A. and Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, is modest. It would not expand the number of gun sales subject to background checks, and it does nothing to close loopholes that allow guns to be sold over the internet, or at gun shows, without background checks on the purchasers.The bill has already passed the House, but it was included in a broader measure that would permit the carrying of concealed firearms virtually anywhere in the country. That provision is a nonstarter in the Senate, which is why Mr. Lance and his colleagues are pushing for a stand-alone vote in the House.Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York and a co-chairman of a bipartisan group of lawmakers known as the Problem Solvers Caucus, said his group planned to tackle the issue of mass shootings this week, with the hope of developing proposals that could become law.Mr. Trump, who is a member of the N.R.A. and ran with its backing, has offered ideas of his own, spending much of last week promoting an N.R.A.-backed proposal to arm teachers.He has also embraced “comprehensive background checks” — without stating precisely what he means — as well as the proposals to raise the minimum age for buying assault weapons to 21. In addition, he has said he supports banning “bump stocks,” which convert semiautomatic guns into automatic weapons and were used last year by the gunman who mowed down concertgoers in Las Vegas.But Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who said in an interview that he favors banning assault weapons — a major break with his party — called the proposed ban on bump stocks a “small step,” and took issue with the age limit proposal. “By raising the minimum age from 18 to 21, then you’re almost officially legalizing assault weapons,” he said.If the latest push for tighter gun restrictions has any better chance of success than the ones that came before, it is in large part a result of the fierce lobbying effort by the student advocates, including those from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the site of this month’s mass shooting.“We have a group of articulate and smart students who are also very angry and have been activated, and so they have captured the attention of our country, including members of Congress,” said Mark Kelly, a founder of Giffords, an advocacy group named for his wife, former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was grievously wounded during a 2011 mass shooting in Tucson.“Congress seems to have a hard time paying attention to important issues long enough to solve them, and they’ll move on to the next thing,” Mr. Kelly said. “I don’t think these kids are going to move on to the next thing.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/books/review/line-becomes-a-river-francisco-cantu.html","THE LINE BECOMES A RIVER Dispatches From the Border By Francisco Cantú 250 pp. Riverhead Books. $26“I’m tired of reading about the border in books,” Francisco Cantú says one Christmas Eve to his mother, who is trying to talk him out of joining the Border Patrol. “I know it might be ugly, I know it might be dangerous, but I don’t see any better way to truly understand the place.”She is dubious. She was a ranger at Guadalupe Mountains National Park, east of El Paso, and tells him there are a hundred other ways for the grandson of a Mexican immigrant to comprehend the border than joining a paramilitary bureaucracy. He is adamant: “Maybe it’s the desert, maybe it’s the closeness of life and death, maybe it’s the tension between the two cultures we carry inside us. Whatever it is, I’ll never understand it unless I’m close to it.”So away he goes, down to America’s most potent metaphor, its 2,000-mile partisan fault line. His mother recedes to the story’s margins, returning now and then to prick his conscience, to tell him to mind his soul.“The Line Becomes a River,” Cantú’s account of four years as a border cop in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, arrives at a dire moment. The national head is spinning with fever visions of brown-skinned alien rapists and beheaders and terror gangs, and of a mythical wall that the president says will protect “us” from “them.” The very idea of an American “us” that includes the foreign-born seems lost to a distant time, to a less terrified country that some of us are struggling to remember.As Cantú tells us what he learned, he bolsters his point — that it’s hard to comprehend the border from books. This one challenges the reader to find the meaning, or some sense, in its loosely strung episodes, fragmentary encounters with border crossers and agents, clippings from books Cantú has read and the surreal dreams that haunt his fretful nights.Cantú finds out that border agents are not so much college boys like him, but former cops and soldiers, migrants from cold climates and crappy jobs. Some new arrivals have no idea what’s going on at the border, but all are primed at the academy for narco warfare, with lurid PowerPoints of people killed by Mexican cartels: heads in an ice chest, bodies stacked in a cattle truck.This is what you’re up against, this is what’s coming, the instructor says.Except it isn’t. The job is often boring, chasing footprints, staring at monitors, shuffling paper. “You don’t want to bring in any bodies with your dope if you can help it,” Cantú is told. “Suspects mean you have a smuggling case on your hands, and that’s a hell of a lot of paperwork.” The aliens we encounter are not narco bosses and murderous kidnappers but their victims: bewildered, disoriented, helpless migrants. Some are dead. They don’t fit the terror profile.A weeping woman tells the agents arresting her that it’s her 23rd birthday. She wants to be like Selena, and sings “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom” on her way to detention. A man found in the fetal position has been drinking his urine for four days. A fat teenager lies sobbing in a mesquite thicket; the group left him behind.Each migrant has a wrenching story, but to agents these are just “wets,” or “POWs,” “plain old wets.” Salvadorans are “el sals.” “Quitters” are just that. Cantú finds two of them huddling in a church, a man and a woman. They had been lost for days, surviving on filthy water from cattle tanks. She is six months pregnant. Cantú gives them water bottles and asks their names, which he soon forgets.In case you think compassion is the rule, Cantú makes a confession.“It’s true that we slash their bottles and drain their water into the dry earth, that we dump their backpacks and pile their food and clothes to be crushed and pissed on and stepped over, strewn across the desert and set ablaze. And Christ, it sounds terrible, and maybe it is.”Maybe?“But the idea is that when they come out from their hiding places, when they regroup and return to find their stockpiles ransacked and stripped, they’ll realize their situation,” he adds, is hopeless. ”And they’ll quit right then and there, they’ll save themselves.” That, says Cantú, is “the sense in it all.”Robbing migrants of water in 115-degree Sonoran heat to save them sounds like exquisitely tortured rationalizing. Recent news accounts and videos of agents destroying water caches suggest that Cantú’s account is accurate, though the Border Patrol has also said it does not condone life-threatening vandalism. So whose logic governs? Who is lying, who has gone rogue — Cantú and his buddies, or the agency itself?Later Cantú tips us to a secret he couldn’t tell his own family — that he and his brother agents ran like a mob of teenage vandals:“I wanted to tell my uncle that I had known men to engage in senseless acts of defilement, depositing car seats and furniture on far-off hillsides and in remote washes, decorating cacti with women’s undergarments, hanging twisted bike frames from the towering arms of saguaros, dislodging massive boulders to tumble down sloping mountainsides, and setting fire to anything that would burn — abandoned automobiles and trash piles and proud desert plants left to smoke and smolder through the night.”They sound like poorly trained men with not enough to do. Yet this is a glancing admission, slipped passively into the narrative without elaboration. Cantú recounts moments of tender connection with frightened, injured border crossers. But he seems unwilling to look too closely at his complicity in despicable behavior, leaving a reader to worry about the fate of that close-up quest for enlightenment he told his mother he was after.We surmise early on that Cantú, his psyche under strain, is not long for the job. He loses sleep, he grinds his teeth, he has bad dreams about wolves.Then the book shifts abruptly. Cantú leaves the agency. Now he’s a barista and studying for a master’s degree. But here, finally, he takes us deep into a border story — that of his new friend José, 30 years in the United States, nabbed by the Border Patrol after returning from Mexico, where he had gone to see his dying mother. The last third of the book, as José and his family desperately fight his deportation, with Cantú’s considerable help, makes a useful contribution to the literature of today’s border. It lays bare, in damning light, the casual brutality of the system, how unjust laws and private prisons and a militarized border have shattered families and mocked America’s myths about itself.“We mostly arrested the little people,” Cantú tells José. “Smugglers, scouts, mules, coyotes. But mostly I arrested migrants, I confessed. People looking for a better life.” He should have listened to his mother.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/world/asia/trump-north-korea-talks.html","TOKYO — North Korea’s declaration at the end of the Winter Olympics of its willingness to start a dialogue with the United States offered a sliver of optimism that the political pageantry of the Games would lead to more substantial results.A day after the closing ceremony, President Trump responded that the United States, too, was interested in talking.“We want to talk also,” Mr. Trump said in remarks to American governors at the White House on Monday. But he quickly added: “only under the right conditions.”“Otherwise,” he said, “we’re not talking.”But Mr. Trump’s hint that talks might be possible came just hours before word emerged of a potential complication to any peace efforts: the looming departure of Joseph Y. Yun, one of the State Department’s most knowledgeable and experienced diplomats on North Korea. Mr. Yun abruptly announced his plan to retire by the end of the week, a departure that could undermine any chances of talks taking place, much less progress being made on curbing North Korea’s nuclear programs.Mr. Yun, the top American envoy on North Korea, helped negotiate the release of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who was imprisoned by North Korea and died days after returning home in a coma last year. He has been a strong advocate for a diplomatic — rather than military — resolution to the North Korean nuclear crisis.It was not clear why Mr. Yun had decided to retire so suddenly. He did not immediately return a request for comment. Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the State Department, said in a statement that Mr. Yun was retiring “for personal reasons” and that Rex W. Tillerson, the secretary of state, “reluctantly accepted his decision.”Analysts were taken aback.“It’s definitely sad news,” said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul, South Korea. Mr. Yun “is very much in favor of compromise and negotiations, and it seems that his voice is not going to be heard.”For the last year and a half, tensions have been building on the Korean Peninsula as both Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, have ratcheted up bellicose attacks that seemed to push the United States and the North closer to a confrontation.The respite of the Olympics — to which North Korea sent 22 athletes and an entourage of dignitaries, cheerleaders and musical performers — along with a break in North Korean missile and nuclear tests since last November raised hopes that tensions were finally easing.But no sooner had the North and the United States declared their willingness to talk to each other — something they have in fact done before — than it became clear that the two sides remained stubbornly far apart.“The North Koreans have always said they would be happy to talk to the United States, and in fact they are eager to come and talk to us — as one nuclear weapons state to another,” said Ralph Cossa, president of the Pacific Forum at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “And the U.S. is willing to talk to the North Koreans if they are prepared to put nuclear weapons on the table. So both sides are willing to talk, but not about the same thing.”While leading the United States delegation to the Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, earlier this month, Vice President Mike Pence planned to secretly meet with a high-level delegation from North Korea, but the North Koreans canceled at the last minute, according to the State Department.“This is the real challenge with North Korea,” said Mr. Cossa. “If you try to confront them, they get their backs up and feel they have to be more confrontational back, to show they are not afraid.””But if you make an overture, they see this as a weakness they have to exploit,” he added. “And if you offer them the moon and the stars, they say ‘O.K., we want the sun also.’”The United Nations Security Council has imposed increasingly strict sanctions on North Korea over its weapons program, but policing violations can be difficult. On Tuesday, Japan’s Foreign Ministry announced that a Japanese military plane on Saturday had detected a North Korean and a Maldavian-flagged ship conducting what Japan judged to be ship-to-ship transfers banned by the Security Council.Many analysts say that the North Korean leadership will never agree to talks if they have to promise to give up their nuclear weapons to get the dialogue started.“I’m very suspicious that there are conditions under which North Korea will denuclearize peacefully,” said Bridget Coggins, an associate professor of political science at University of California at Santa Barbara.Given that North Korea believes that nuclear weapons protect the country from an attack by the United States, “I don’t see there being a lot of breakthroughs,” she said. “There would never be a security guarantee that would be sufficient enough for denuclearization to happen.”To get any kind of dialogue going, Ms. Coggins said the United States might have to accept a freeze in missile or nuclear tests instead of demanding that the North agree to give up its arsenal altogether.“It seems like there have been a lot of opportunities to win points and move the ball forward in terms of pulling back from crisis if that is in fact what the United States wants,” said Ms. Coggins. “And those opportunities haven’t been seized.”Mr. Trump did not specify what he meant by the “right conditions” for talks, but Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, added context in remarks to reporters on Monday.“Let us be completely clear,” she said. “Denuclearization must be the result of any dialogue with North Korea. Until then, the United States and the world must continue to make it known that North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs are a dead end.”Mr. Yun had previously hinted that while getting North Korea to give up its weapons program was the ultimate goal of the United States, talks might begin on the basis of a freeze in the North’s nuclear and missile testing.“North Korea stopping missile tests and nuclear tests would be a great first step,” Mr. Yun said last month at a conference in Tokyo.Analysts said one of the obstacles to talks was that the Trump administration continuously sends inconsistent signals.“The administration isn’t reading from one book on North Korea policy,” said Ankit Panda, a senior editor at the Diplomat, a foreign affairs magazine, and a regional security analyst. “We’ll hear different officials hint at different approaches.”With the United States and South Korea likely to resume joint military exercises soon, Mr. Panda warned of “a spiral of U.S. and South Korean exercises being responded to by new provocations from the North.”There is more promise of talks continuing between North and South Korea. On Tuesday in Seoul, Kim Yong-chol, the chief North Korean delegate, had breakfast with Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon of South Korea and Suh Hoon, director of the South’s National Intelligence Service. The two sides agreed that the North and South would continue to work to improve ties and help ensure peace on the peninsula.Ms. Coggins said that such talks were not likely to lead to a change in the North’s nuclear program, but they could lead to promising moves, like reunions of families that have been divided since the Korean War.“These are smaller things that are impactful and meaningful, in not just a sentimental way but to kind of bridge the social divide between North and South in a way that is productive going forward,” said Ms. Coggins. She said such talks might even help bring about the release of three Americans still detained in North Korea.Analysts said that if South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, accepts an invitation to visit Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang, Mr. Moon might broker talks between the United States and the North.“The scope and space for diplomacy is wider today than it was,” said Scott Snyder, director of United States-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/stacey-dash-clueless-congress.html","The actress Stacey Dash, best known for starring in the 1995 movie “Clueless,” is now aiming for Congress.In paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission on Monday, Ms. Dash declared her candidacy for the House of Representatives in California’s 44th District, a Democratic stronghold in the southern suburbs of Los Angeles.As a Republican, Ms. Dash is likely to face an uphill battle in the district, which is currently represented by Nanette Barragán, a Democrat. Hillary Clinton received 83 percent of the vote there in the 2016 presidential election, and Barack Obama won similar shares in 2008 and 2012.Ms. Dash, 51, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday evening and has not announced her candidacy publicly, beyond the F.E.C. filing. She hinted at it in a series of tweets, however, writing: “Formal statements coming. For those mocking for the district I live in...open your minds. It’s time to for me to put up or shut up and I want to serve great people.”“I live in the 44th unlike some who don’t live in their districts,” she added. “Thank you to those who offered their support.”Ms. Dash came onto the political stage in earnest in 2012, when she endorsed Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign. She was a Fox News contributor from 2014 to 2016 and an early supporter of President Trump. Her endorsements of Republican candidates drew significant attention, and backlash, in part because she is a black woman.In an interview with the journalist Nicholas Ballasy in June 2016, after she released a memoir titled “There Goes My Social Life: From Clueless to Conservative,” Ms. Dash said she had been ostracized in Hollywood because of her political views. Her agents had dropped her, she said, and she had not auditioned for a role in more than a year.Asked in that interview how she would pitch Mr. Trump to African-American and Hispanic voters, she paraphrased the adage that “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”“Why do you keep voting Democrat, and nothing changes?” asked Ms. Dash, who has said she voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 before switching parties. “Try something new. Especially a guy who’s not the establishment. He’s not the man, as they say it. The establishment doesn’t even like him. But he’s a Republican. He’s a conservative.”In interviews, Ms. Dash has defended Mr. Trump against charges of racism. She has also stirred up her own controversy on issues of race. On one occasion, appearing on “Fox & Friends” in January 2016, she said she did not believe Black History Month or BET should exist.“We have to make up our minds,” she said. “Either we want to have segregation or integration. And if we don’t want segregation, then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the Image Awards, where you’re only awarded if you’re black. If it were the other way around, we would be up in arms. It’s a double standard.”Ms. Dash wrote in her memoir that her views were shaped by her experience growing up in the South Bronx with drug-addicted parents. People on welfare were not respected there, she said. But the “hustlers” — who made a living for themselves and would abide no attempt to take away their money or their guns — were.“When I say things, I don’t say them from a place of judgment but from a place of experience,” she told Mr. Ballasy.She added that she believed people could be persuaded to vote Republican “if we just say it the right way and show them what the truth is, and go into the inner cities and show them that the narrative they’re being fed by the plantation mentality of the Democrats is false.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/mississippi-mcdaniel-wicker-primary-fight.html","WASHINGTON — State Senator Chris McDaniel, who nearly beat an incumbent senator in 2014, is expected to announce this week that he will challenge Mississippi’s junior United States senator, Roger Wicker, testing the potency of an anti-establishment message in the Trump era.After months of speculation about his intentions, Mr. McDaniel said in a Facebook video Monday night that he would reveal his decision at a hometown rally in Ellisville, Miss., on Wednesday, the day before the filing period to run in 2018 comes to an end.“We’re looking for a fight, and I can’t wait for you to be on my team again,” he said in the video.Yet even as Republicans familiar with his planning said that Mr. McDaniel would take on Mr. Wicker, there is still uncertainty about which of the two Mississippi Senate seats Mr. McDaniel will ultimately attempt to claim.Mr. McDaniel, 45, a hard-line conservative, nearly unseated Mississippi’s senior senator, Thad Cochran, four years ago in an extraordinarily bitter, racially tinged primary that exposed the depth of hostilities between the party’s Tea Party and establishment wings. Mr. Cochran, now 80, has suffered health challenges, creating expectations in Republican circles that he would resign and leave the state’s other seat up for grabs.With Mr. Cochran ailing, Mr. McDaniel put off his long-anticipated challenge of Mr. Wicker and turned his sights to what multiple Mississippians said was his preference: receiving assurances from Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, that the appointment would be his once the senior senator stepped down.But Mr. Bryant has firmly refused to offer any such guarantee, and when approached by a reporter at a meeting of the National Governors Association here this weekend, the governor smiled and said: “I think Senator Cochran is doing a great job.”So with no promise of an appointment, no certainty Mr. Cochran will resign and a filing deadline looming, Mr. McDaniel has returned to his original plan of challenging Mr. Wicker, a mild-mannered and establishment-aligned lawmaker.Mr. Wicker, 66, could prove difficult for Mr. McDaniel to defeat. President Trump, stung by the defeat of Roy S. Moore last year in Alabama, has already conveyed his support to Mr. Wicker and has little appetite to risk another Senate seat in the Deep South. In fact, Mr. Trump has wooed Mr. Bryant to appoint himself to Mr. Cochran’s Senate seat, should it come open, to block Mr. McDaniel and pre-empt a nasty intraparty feud.But Mr. McDaniel is not without assets. He is well known among the state’s conservative activists thanks to his 2014 run, when he outpolled Mr. Cochran in the first Republican balloting, and already has a “super PAC” airing radio ads and lining up field staff to help his campaign.“Mississippi deserves a constitutional conservative who holds the same values as Mississippians and is a consistent and strong voice for them in Washington, D.C.,” said Tommy Barnett, the treasurer of the Remember Mississippi super PAC. “We can’t wait to support a McDaniel run. Bring it on.”The group had raised over $1 million as of late last month, winning support from a few major Republican donors including the Illinois industrialist Richard Uihlein.To many veteran Mississippi Republicans, though, the specter of yet another bloody Republican primary, whether against Mr. Wicker or for Mr. Cochran’s seat, is stomach-turning.Joe Nosef, who was the state party chairman during the 2014 race, is close to Mr. Wicker but related by marriage to Mr. McDaniel. Noting that he stepped down from his post this past fall, Mr. Nosef said, “When I think of the things I’m going to miss about being state chairman, this race, if it happens, isn’t going to rank at the top, middle or bottom of that list.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/business/economy/labor-board.html","First, it reversed an Obama-era rule helping workers challenge the labor practices of big chains. On Monday, the National Labor Relations Board reversed its reversal.The move will make it easier to hold companies responsible for labor law violations committed by franchisees and contractors.Labor advocates and business groups alike were surprised by the turnabout, but it did not reflect any ideological shift. Rather, it followed a determination that a member of the board’s Republican majority had a conflict of interest in the earlier vote.A report released in early February by the agency’s inspector general found that the member, William J. Emanuel, should have recused himself when the case came before the board in December, shortly after the Republicans gained control. That would have left it split at two votes apiece and preserved the status quo.On Monday, three other board members, including its Republican chairman, Marvin E. Kaplan, voted to vacate the December decision, citing a determination that Mr. Emanuel “is, and should have been, disqualified from participating in this proceeding” because his former law firm had handled a related case.That opens the door for the more expansive, Obama-era standard to remain in place for several more months, perhaps even years.Wilma B. Liebman, a Democratic former board member who served as chairwoman early in the Obama administration, said it was highly unusual for a labor board ruling to be reversed because of a conflict — perhaps illustrating the stakes involved.“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ms. Liebman said.Two Democratic senators, Patty Murray of Washington and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have been outspoken in recent months in pointing to Mr. Emanuel’s potential conflicts.The issue before the board involved a doctrine known as joint employment. A company, like a fast-food corporation, that is deemed a joint employer of workers at a franchisee can be held liable for violations of their labor rights — such as illegally firing workers involved in an organizing campaign — and can be required to bargain with them if they unionize.Before 2015, a company could be considered a joint employer under federal labor law only if it exercised direct and immediate control over workers at the franchise.But in a case known as Browning-Ferris, the board ruled that the parent company could be deemed a joint employer even if the control it exerted was indirect — for example, if it forced the franchisee to use software that committed it to certain scheduling practices. The board ruled that the parent company could also be considered a joint employer if the company had the right to exercise control over a franchisee that it did not exercise in practice.The more liberal definition of who qualified as a joint employer removed a potentially significant obstacle to workers at fast-food restaurants and hotels who sought to unionize. A parent company that terminates a franchise agreement to avoid doing business with a franchisee whose workers are trying to unionize may face legal liability for doing so if it is considered a joint employer.In December, the board, with its new Republican majority, took up a case known as Hy-Brand and voted to revert to the pre-2015 standard requiring direct and immediate control.But that case did not raise any questions that hinged on what standard to apply — the Obama-era guidelines or the previous ones. Partly as a result, the inspector general argued in his report, it was simply a pretext for relitigating Browning-Ferris.“The practical effect of the Hy-Brand deliberative process was a ‘do-over’ for the Browning-Ferris parties,” the inspector general stated.This created the potential conflict for Mr. Emanuel, whose former law firm had represented a party in the Browning-Ferris case. If the more recent case was simply a do-over for the previous case, the inspector general argued, then Mr. Emanuel should have recused himself.Ms. Liebman, the former chairwoman, said the board would presumably be able to try again. But she said it would have to wait for a case raising its own questions about which joint-employer doctrine is correct, rather than simply use any vaguely related case as a pretext for revisiting the Obama-era decision.“In some future case, where the issue actually arises and some party is seeking a reversal of Browning-Ferris, where more of a deliberation goes on, that could be another vehicle,” she said, adding that there was less likely to be a conflict for Mr. Emanuel in that instance. “This is likely just a reprieve.”For their part, business groups frustrated with the frequently shifting joint-employer definition argued that it was yet another reason for Congress to settle the issue with legislation.“This throws the whole situation back into question for a potentially extended period,” said Matthew Haller, a senior vice president at the International Franchise Association. “Our focus has been — and remains — on the need for Congress to provide legislative certainty.”Mr. Haller added that the House had passed such legislation in November and that it was now all the more urgent for the Senate “to step into the breach.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/delta-nra-georgia-tax-cut.html","The lieutenant governor in Georgia threatened on Monday to kill a proposed lucrative tax cut for Delta Air Lines after the company eliminated a discount fare program for the National Rifle Association over the weekend.The move by Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who presides over the State Senate, immediately put the legislation in jeopardy and put him at loggerheads with other top state officials, including the governor, who had championed the tax deal. The showdown between one of Georgia’s most powerful politicians and one of the state’s largest employers was the latest clash in a national debate around guns after the deadly school shooting in Florida this month.Mr. Cagle, a Republican, fired the salvo at Delta on Twitter on Monday afternoon, saying that the Atlanta-based company must restore its program with the N.R.A. “Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,” Mr. Cagle, who had expressed his support for the bill earlier this month, said on Twitter.Mr. Cagle, who received an A+ grade by the N.R.A. when he was running for his position in 2006, did not return a call seeking comment on Monday evening. As the Senate president, Mr. Cagle wields significant influence over legislation and how it flows through the Senate, where Republicans hold a 37 to 19 majority over Democrats.A spokeswoman for Gov. Nathan Deal, who had said the tax bill was necessary to encourage airlines to open direct routes from Georgia to destinations around the world, did not return an email seeking comment.Other Republicans in the State Legislature also on Monday pulled back their support for the bill, which would grant a $50 million sales tax exemption on jet fuel, primarily benefiting Delta. Among the new critics was the House speaker, David Ralston, who said on Monday that he was disappointed with Delta and wished it had announced the decision before the House approved the tax bill on Thursday. The legislation moved the next day to the Senate, where it seemed to have broad support.But on Saturday, that support all but evaporated after Delta announced it had eliminated a discount fare program for travelers to attend the N.R.A.’s 2018 annual meeting in May. The airline, which had come under growing pressure from its customers and others to cut ties with the gun group, said its decision “reflects the airline’s neutral status in the current national debate over gun control amid recent school shootings.”Delta said in a statement on Saturday that it supported the Second Amendment but has refrained from political issues before. The airline noted that it withdrew financial support of a New York production of “Julius Caesar” last summer because it depicted the assassination of a Trump-like Roman ruler.In the days after the shooting massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., more than a dozen companies, including MetLife Insurance, Symantec and Enterprise, cut ties with the N.R.A. Many were being threatened with boycotts over the deals and discounts they had offered to the gun group’s members.Also on Monday, FedEx made an unusual move by declaring its opposition to the N.R.A.’s stance on gun policy and safety while saying it “does not and will not deny service or discriminate against any legal entity regardless of their policy positions or political views.”FedEx said that the N.R.A. was one of hundreds of organizations whose members receive discounts on shipping rates. It also pushed for “urgent action” from local, state and federal politicians to prevent future mass shootings.“FedEx opposes assault rifles being in the hands of civilians,” the company said in a statement. “While we strongly support the constitutional right of U.S. citizens to own firearms subject to appropriate background checks, FedEx views assault rifles and large-capacity magazines as an inherent potential danger to schools, workplaces, and communities when such weapons are misused.”Over the weekend, celebrities like Julianne Moore, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Zach Braff posted their plans to boycott FedEx until the company stopped partnering with the N.R.A.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/melania-trump-student-protests-parkland-guns.html","WASHINGTON — In rare public remarks on Monday, the first lady, Melania Trump, voiced support for the student-led demonstrations that have unfolded after a school shooting left 17 dead in Parkland, Fla., many of which have called for gun restrictions her husband has resisted.“I have been heartened to see children across this country using their voices to speak out and try to create change,” Mrs. Trump said. “They’re our future and they deserve a voice.”Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a briefing on Monday that the president also supported the student protesters.“That’s the reason why he had a number of them here at the White House just last week,” Ms. Sanders said.Mrs. Trump’s remarks were delivered at the White House to about two dozen spouses of governors visiting Washington to meet with President Trump. At just over three minutes, the remarks amounted to a lengthy speech for a first lady who has not offered more than a few public words in months, and spent much of the winter shielding herself and her 11-year-old son, Barron, from view.Mrs. Trump, who recently traveled with her husband to Florida to meet with two victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, was light on details but voiced a willingness to address school safety and the opioid epidemic.“As a parent, I cannot imagine the kind of grief and tragedy like that brings,” Mrs. Trump told the governors’ spouses, who had gathered in the Blue Room for lunch on Monday.Many of the students have called for more restrictive gun control measures than Mr. Trump and most congressional Republicans have been willing to endorse. Their push has resulted in tense moments with lawmakers, as when students heatedly questioned Senator Marco Rubio of Florida last week at a forum and one survivor tearfully pleaded with Mr. Trump at the White House last week to ban weapons like the one used in the Parkland shooting.The East Wing has not unveiled a significant policy initiative, but Mrs. Trump recently hired a policy director who could push any nascent plans forward. In the past, Mrs. Trump has given few clues as to where she may focus her efforts, but she has also publicly expressed interest in helping children affected by the opioid crisis, advocating anti-bullying measures and aiding disaster relief efforts.On Monday, shortly after reflecting on the Parkland shooting, Mrs. Trump said adults should take responsibility for monitoring children’s behavior on social media.“As I have said before, it is important that, as adults, we take the lead and the responsibility in helping our children manage the many issues they are facing today,” she said. “This means encouraging positive habits with social media and technology, even limiting time online and understanding the content they are exposed to on a daily basis.”In recent days, students with connections to the shooting have called for Mrs. Trump to take action on her past remarks about combating cyberbullying. Lauren Hogg, the younger sister of David Hogg, one of the most outspoken of the Parkland students, said her family had received death threats since Mr. Trump’s oldest son, Donald Jr., appeared to endorse a conspiracy theory about her brother on Twitter.“Hey @FLOTUS you say that your mission as first lady is to stop cyber bullying,” Ms. Hogg wrote, “well then, don’t you think it would have been smart to have a convo with your step-son @DonaldJTrumpJr before he liked a post about a false conspiracy theory which in turn put a target on my back.”As she closed her speech, Mrs. Trump told members of her audience that the East Wing would reach out in the near future “as we travel the country and work to promote and fight for the well-being of our children.”The White House did not provide details about what those plans would entail.“It just means that as she is cultivating these relationships with political spouses, she wants to work with them on issues that they all care about — children,” Mrs. Trump’s spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said in an email.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/ivanka-trump-donald-sexual-misconduct.html","Should the women who have accused the president of sexual misconduct be believed? That’s a question that his elder daughter and White House senior adviser, Ivanka Trump, believes she should not be asked.“I think it’s a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter if she believes the accusers of her father when he’s affirmatively stated that there’s no truth to it,” Ms. Trump told the NBC News correspondent Peter Alexander in an interview that aired on NBC’s “Today” on Monday.Ms. Trump had been in South Korea since Friday, leading the United States delegation at the Winter Olympics. In a wide-ranging interview there on Sunday, Mr. Alexander asked her, “Do you believe your father’s accusers?”“I don’t think that’s a question you would ask many other daughters,” she said. “I believe my father. I know my father. So, I think I have that right as a daughter to believe my father.”Ms. Trump’s suggestion that she be spared the question faced pushback online from journalists and others, who noted that she not only led the American delegation for the closing ceremony of the Olympics, but has also positioned herself as a voice for women’s issues inside the White House.Some conservatives, in the meantime, suggested that her dismissal of the question was akin to one offered by Chelsea Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign, when asked whether her father’s sex scandal had affected her mother’s credibility.In the NBC interview, Ms. Trump also said that she had not yet been interviewed by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, but that she believed Mr. Mueller could be trusted. She also repeated the White House’s denials that her father’s presidential campaign had colluded with Moscow.“Consistently we have said there was no collusion,” she said. “There was no collusion. And we believe that Mueller will do his work and reach that same conclusion.”Ms. Trump also appeared to diverge slightly from her father, who, in response to the fatal shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., this month, had suggested that arming some teachers could improve school safety.“To be honest, I don’t know,” she said. “I think that having a teacher who is armed, who cares deeply about her students, or his students, and who is capable and qualified to bear arms is not a bad idea, but it’s an idea that needs to be discussed.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/supreme-court-unions-gorsuch.html","WASHINGTON — A crucial voice was silent at Supreme Court arguments on Monday in a case that could deal a sharp blow to public unions. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, who almost certainly holds the decisive vote, asked no questions, leaving some doubt, if only a glimmer, about whether he would join the court’s conservative majority to rule that forcing workers to support public unions violates the First Amendment.Justice Gorsuch generally votes with the court’s conservatives, and he is likely to do so in this case. But his silence during the argument meant that observers knew no more about his thinking by the time it ended than when it had begun.Two years ago, the court seemed poised to rule against public unions, but it deadlocked 4 to 4 after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Monday’s case, Janus v. American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, No. 16-1466, presented the same legal issue. The only real difference was that Justice Gorsuch had taken Justice Scalia’s place.Once again, the heated questioning during Monday’s arguments confirmed that the court was sharply divided along ideological lines.The court’s more conservative members said that requiring workers who choose not to join public unions to pay for collective bargaining and similar activities is an affront to their right to free speech.“When you compel somebody to speak, don’t you infringe that person’s dignity and conscience?” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked.The court’s more liberal members said that states should have broad leeway in managing public workplaces. They added that a decision against the unions would require overruling a 40-year-old precedent, striking down more than 20 state laws, creating confusion about thousands of union contracts and disrupting the lives of millions of workers.“I don’t think that we have ever overruled a case where reliance interests are remotely as strong as they are here,” Justice Elena Kagan said.A decision overruling the precedent would conclude a decades-long political and legal campaign by conservative groups aimed at weakening public-sector unions. Those unions stand to lose fees from workers who object to the positions the unions take and from those who simply choose not to join while benefiting from the unions’ efforts on their behalf.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg reflected on the consequences of ruling against the union in the case before the court. “It drains it of resources that make it an equal partner” with the government in negotiations, she told William L. Messenger, a lawyer for Mark Janus, an Illinois child support specialist who objected to positions taken by his union in negotiations. “And then you’ll have a union with diminished resources, not able to investigate what it should demand at the bargaining table, not equal to the employer that it faces.”Near the end of the argument, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the case represented an existential threat to the labor movement. “You’re basically arguing, ‘Do away with unions,’ ” she told Mr. Messenger.The case was a challenge to an Illinois law that requires government workers who choose not to join unions to “pay their proportionate share of the costs of the collective bargaining process, contract administration and pursuing matters affecting wages, hours and other conditions of employment.” More than 20 states have similar laws.The Supreme Court ruled that such laws are constitutional in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, a foundational 1977 decision that made a distinction between two kinds of compelled payments. Forcing nonmembers to pay for a union’s political activities violated the First Amendment, the court said. But it was constitutional, the court added, to require nonmembers to help pay for the union’s collective bargaining efforts to prevent freeloading and ensure “labor peace.”Conservative groups have long urged the court to overrule the Abood decision, and they have repeatedly gotten close to their goal. In 2014, the court stopped just short of overruling the decision.When the court revisited the issue in 2016, the Obama administration argued in favor of the unions. The Trump administration switched sides in the new case, prompting a comment from Justice Sotomayor to Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco.“This is such a radical new position on your part,” she said.Justice Kagan noted that the administration’s position could open the federal government to First Amendment challenges in various kinds of workplace disputes. “It strikes me as a very unusual position for the government to be taking,” Justice Kagan said, perhaps reflecting on her own experience in representing the government as solicitor general in the Obama administration.Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who is the court’s most ardent supporter of broad First Amendment rights, made clear that he had no patience with mandatory fees, calling them “compelled subsidization of a private party, a private party that expresses political views constantly.”The lawyers in the case gave varying answers to questions about what would happen if the mandatory fees were eliminated. “When these kinds of obligations of financial support become voluntary, union membership goes down, union density rates go down, union resources go down,” said David L. Franklin, Illinois’s solicitor general, who argued in support of the union.“When unions are deprived of agency fees, they tend to become more militant, more confrontational,” he added. “They go out in search of short-term gains that they can bring back to their members and say, ‘Stick with us.’”Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said there were arguments on the other side.“The need to attract voluntary payments will make the unions more efficient, more effective, more attractive to a broader group of their employees,” the chief justice said.David C. Frederick, a lawyer for the union, said it should be free to fight for higher wages. “Most public servants are underpaid,” he said, “and I will stipulate to that before this body.”That elicited a smile from Chief Justice Roberts, who was a successful lawyer in private practice and took a big pay cut when he became a judge.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/world/asia/china-xi-jinping-authoritarianism.html","BEIJING — There was a time, not so long ago, when a Chinese leader setting himself up as ruler for life would have stirred international condemnation for bucking the global trend toward greater democracy. Now, such an action seems fully in keeping with moves by many countries in the other direction.The surprise disclosure on Sunday that the Communist Party was abolishing constitutional limits on presidential terms — effectively allowing President Xi Jinping to lead China indefinitely — was the latest and arguably most significant sign of the world’s decisive tilt toward authoritarian governance, often built on the highly personalized exercise of power.The list includes Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, all of whom have abandoned most pretenses that they rule according to the people’s will. Authoritarianism is also reappearing in places like Hungary and Poland that barely a quarter-century ago shook loose the shackles of Soviet oppression.There are many reasons for such moves by Mr. Xi and others — including protecting their power and perks in an age of unrest, terrorism and war amplified by new technologies — but a significant one is that few countries have the standing or authority, morally or otherwise, to speak out — least of all, critics say, the United States.“I mean, who is going to punish him internationally now?” asked Susan L. Shirk, the chairwoman of the 21st Century China Program at the University of California, San Diego.She and other experts described this “authoritarian reversion” as a global contagion that has undermined the abiding faith that forging liberal democracies and market economies was the surest path to prosperity and equality.“Thirty years ago, with what Xi did, with what Erdogan has done, there would have been an outpouring of international concern: ‘You’re getting off the path,’ and so on,” said Michael A. McFaul, a political scientist and diplomat who, before serving as the American ambassador in Moscow from 2012 to 2014, wrote extensively on building democracies.“Nobody is making that argument today,” he added, “certainly not Trump.”President Trump’s administration on Monday brushed off questions about Mr. Xi’s move. “I believe that’s a decision for China to make about what’s best for their country,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. “But as you know, the president’s talked about term limits in a number of capacities during the campaign. It’s something that he supports here in the United States, but that’s a decision that would be up to China.”Almost no one would have described China as genuinely democratic before the latest move, which was announced without fanfare on Sunday; the country remains a one-party state with extensive control over political, social and economic life.Even so, Mr. Xi’s gambit ended a period of collective and term-limited leadership begun by Jiang Zemin, who held the same post as Mr. Xi from 1993 to 2003, that many had hoped was leading China toward greater rule of law and openness. This shift confirms a growing view that those expectations were probably naïve, some say.“We’re deluded in our conviction that everybody is going to become a democracy like us,” said Merriden Varrall, the director of the East Asia Program at the Lowy Institute in Australia.Mr. Xi, who will be 69 when his second five-year term ends in 2023, is not simply following the example set by Mr. Putin or other leaders, she and other experts said. His motivations are unique to Chinese history and politics. Yet, they are deeply shaped by the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and collapse of the Soviet Union two years later.Those historical milestones ushered in an era of expanding political and economic freedoms. Mr. McFaul said that for nearly a quarter of a century autocratic leaders “had to play defense” against the democratizing trend that seized the post-Cold War order.Even the Russia that emerged from the ruins of the Soviet Union adopted a democratic constitution and instituted free elections. Whatever the chaos of Boris N. Yeltsin’s era in the 1990s, democracy was taking root when Mr. Putin came to power — in a relatively free and fair election, no less.The rumination of Francis Fukuyama, the scholar, has come up repeatedly. In a famous essay titled “The End of History?” (note the question mark), he argued that Western liberal democracy had become recognized as “the final form of human government.”“The end of history is no more,” Brad W. Setser, a Treasury official during the Obama administration who is now at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in a message after news emerged of Mr. Xi’s move.In hindsight, Mr. Putin was the vanguard of what Mr. McFaul called the “illiberal international,” a new version of the Communist International founded by Lenin to spread communism around the world.Authoritarian leaders now act with greater impunity — or at least less worry about international isolation. Aspiring authoritarians like Viktor Orban of Hungary in turn seem enticed by the kind of power Mr. Putin and Mr. Xi wield, untroubled by the need to compromise or consult or, in the case of corruption and cronyism, to answer for evidence of misrule and malfeasance.President Trump’s critics say that while he may not yet have eroded democracy in the United States, his populist appeals and nativist policies, his palpable aversion to the news media and traditional checks on power, and his stated admiration for some of the strongest of strongmen are cut from the same cloth.The trend toward authoritarianism, while specific to each country’s history, is rooted in insecurities and fears afflicting the world today: globalization and rising inequality, the stunning and scary advances in technology, the disorienting chaos and extreme violence of civil wars like Syria’s, separatism and terror.The institutions of the post-Cold War — which reflected the bedrock values of Western liberalism — no longer seem able to cope. Countries that once were beacons for others are consumed by the same anxiety and weakness, and internal strife.Mr. Putin has long cited such flaws to shore up his power at home; the campaign to interfere in the 2016 presidential election in the United States seemed intended, in the first place, to discredit American democracy still more.“Liberal democracies in the United States and even in Europe no longer look like such an inspiring model for others to follow,” said Mr. McFaul, whose book on his experience shepherding Russian policy in the Obama administration, “From Cold War to Hot Peace: An American Ambassador in Putin’s Russia,” will be published in May.From China’s perspective, the end of the Cold War was hardly an inspiration, having led to the toppling of one-party dictatorships. The “contagion” of 1989, which saw popular protesters bring down Communist governments in Central and Eastern Europe, infected China, too. A few months before the Berlin Wall came down, Chinese students massing in Tiananmen Square posed what officials in Beijing viewed as an existential threat, a legacy that continues to color everything the government does to this day.“If anything gives Xi Jinping and the party nightmares, it is perestroika and the fall of the Soviet Union,” Ms. Varrall said, referring to the reforms the last Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, sought before the system unraveled.Mr. Xi, as a result, believes that only stability can ensure his vision of China’s revival and emergence as the world’s power. “He seems to genuinely believe that he’s the only person who can achieve this vision,” she said. In last fall’s Communist Party congress, Mr. Xi even presented China as a new model for the developing world — a thinly veiled argument that the United States and Europe were no longer as attractive as they once were.The need for a strong grip appears to be a long-held conviction of Mr. Xi’s. According to a 2009 diplomatic cable disclosed by WikiLeaks, an old associate told the American ambassador in Beijing at the time, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., that as a son of one of China’s communist revolutionary leaders, Mr. Xi was an elitist who believed deeply in the unwavering authority of the party.“One cannot entirely escape one’s past,” the associate said. “Xi does not want to.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/world/middleeast/jerusalem-us-embassy.html","JERUSALEM — For what may be the most visible foreign policy step the United States has taken since President Trump took office, the American Embassy set to open in Jerusalem in three months is a bit hard to spot.The ambassador’s new quarters — really, a provisional office until a full-fledged embassy building is erected — will be located in what is now the consular services section of the United States Consulate General, a low-lying, fortresslike compound. It is half-hidden down a steep incline off a quiet, residential street a few miles south of the Old City. Not much can be seen from the road, apart from a large American flag flying from the rooftop.But the Trump administration’s decision to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem has not gone unnoticed. Nor has Washington’s seeming determination to accelerate the move.When Mr. Trump announced in December that he was veering from almost seven decades of American policy — and that of the vast majority of the world’s nations — and formally recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, White House officials spoke of the embassy move taking several years.A month later, addressing the Israeli Parliament, Vice President Mike Pence pledged that the new embassy would open by the end of 2019.Then, on Friday, the White House said that it wanted to open a temporary embassy in Jerusalem in time for the 70th anniversary of the creation of the state of Israel, on May 14. As a first step, the State Department said, the consular building in the Arnona neighborhood would carve out some office space for Ambassador David M. Friedman and a small staff, and would become the interim Embassy.By the end of next year, the compound is to be expanded to include an interim embassy annex providing more office space for the ambassador and his team. Mr. Friedman is expected to commute from his seaside residence in Herzliyya, north of Tel Aviv, until a secure residence can be found in Jerusalem.A search is underway for a site for a permanent embassy to be built, but for the foreseeable future, the face of the United States government will be in Arnona.The consular section there, which opened in 2010, is the newest and most secure United States facility in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, according to a State Department official. The official added that there was no change to the mandate of the consulate general, which is housed in a separate, historic building in central Jerusalem and engages in a wide range of political, economic, cultural, and educational contacts in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as in Jerusalem, and also serves American citizens there.Life in Arnona seemed to be continuing quietly Sunday morning. Across the street from the American consular compound, Naomi Elook, 63, an Israel cosmetician, runs a small beauty salon in the basement of the apartment building where she has lived for 30 years. A young Muslim woman in a flowered head scarf was waiting for a treatment, and Ms. Elook said that 80 percent of her clients were Palestinians from East Jerusalem.“I am happy about the embassy move,” she said. “It will enrich the neighborhood and bring more security.”The Arnona compound sits between the predominantly Jewish West Jerusalem and East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 war and then annexed in a move that was never internationally recognized. But the compound has always been in Israel’s possession and so is not, experts say, considered occupied territory.“There are infinite ways in which the embassy move is horrible, counterproductive, destructive,” said Daniel Seidemann, an Israeli attorney who specializes in Jerusalem affairs. “But the site is not the problem.”Within the compound sits a decades-old former hotel, aptly named The Diplomat, which the Americans rent out as a facility for elderly Russian-speaking immigrants. Laundry hangs on lines outside some of the windows. One resident, Charna Kommar, 80, who arrived from Moscow in 2004, seemed pleased with the prospect of her new neighbor, saying it was “very important” to have the embassy in Jerusalem.Another small stone building in the compound houses the head office of “Burgers Bar,” a popular Israeli food chain.Some in Arnona worry that the temporary embassy could prove disruptive. Among them is Michael Frisher, 52, a driving instructor who has been taking students into the neighborhood for 20 years because it is on the city’s test route. “For us, it’s not good,” he said. “It could disturb us. They could close the roads.”A fellow driving instructor, Ovadia Tamir, also 52, said that while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is mired in corruption investigations, might get a political lift from the embassy move, no one else was benefiting.“This will only help Netanyahu, nobody else,” Mr. Tamir said.Worried about Palestinian anger over the coming embassy, he added, “We don’t want trouble.”On Sunday, the prime minister commended the news from Washington about the earlier embassy move. “This is a great moment for the citizens of Israel, and this is an historic moment for the state of Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu said. (American officials also said on Friday that Sheldon G. Adelson, an American known for his hawkish support of Israel, had offered to help pay for the new embassy building.)The Palestinians issued more condemnations. “The United States has become part of the problem and not the solution,” Husam Zomlot, who leads the Palestinian delegation to Washington, told Voice of Palestine Radio.The United States may have the anniversary of Israel’s founding in mind as it times the embassy relocation, but the Palestinians view things through a different lens. For them, May 14 is the 70th anniversary of the Nakba, or “catastrophe,” when hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were expelled or fled their homes amid the hostilities surrounding Israel’s establishment.As it happens, this year’s anniversary could also fall on the eve of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting, which, depending on the sighting of the new moon, is expected to start at sundown on May 15. Days later, Palestinians are likely to flock for Friday Prayer to the holy site in the Old City that contains Al Aqsa Mosque, which has often been a flash point in the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.The calendrical coincidence combining nationalism and religion encapsulates the seething divide over Jerusalem, the seat of Israel’s government and the location of major holy sites sacred to Muslims, Christians and Jews. When the United States recognized Jerusalem, said, Zakaria al-Qaq, a Palestinian professor at Al Quds University in East Jerusalem, “That was the major headline.”The relocation of the ambassador, he said, is “a detail” that has not moved many Palestinians. But the combination of the Nakba commemoration and Ramadan could change things.“This,” Mr. Qaq said, “is the complexity and delicacy of the issue.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/us/politics/trump-europe-iran-deal.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s threat to rip up the Iran nuclear deal has touched off an urgent scramble in European capitals to preserve the agreement — not by rewriting it, but by creating a successor deal intended to halt Iran’s ballistic missile program and make permanent the restrictions on its ability to produce nuclear fuel.As the two sides prepare to meet for trans-Atlantic talks next month in Berlin, the Europeans are demanding a guarantee that Mr. Trump will abide by the add-on deal after it is negotiated and not jettison it on some other pretext. Mr. Trump has called the 2015 agreement that was negotiated by President Barack Obama “the worst deal” ever and has told Britain, France and Germany to fix it by May 12 or he will pull the United States out.The Iranians have so far dismissed efforts by the State Department to impose strict new terms on Tehran — or face threats of renewed sanctions if it fails to comply — as a backdoor effort to reopen the original agreement that limits Iran’s nuclear program.The European demand comes under duress. Talking points that Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson recently circulated to American diplomats in Europe warned that “in the absence of a clear commitment from your side to address these issues, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal.”The instructions, which were shown to The New York Times, stipulate that the Europeans agree to three key fixes: a commitment to renegotiate limits on missile testing by Iran; an assurance that inspectors have unfettered access to Iranian military bases; and an extension of the deal’s expiration dates to prevent Iran from resuming the production of nuclear fuel long after the current restrictions expire in 2030.European diplomats said there was scope for an agreement on missiles and inspections, but not yet on the length of the deal. They argue that rewriting those terms would break the bargain they struck, not only with Iran but also with Russia and China, two other signatories. And breaching the deal, they say, would free Iran to pursue nuclear weapons again.The upcoming talks are being led by Brian H. Hook, a low-key Republican lawyer who is the State Department’s director of policy planning, who has said he would bring the European request for a guarantee back to Washington. European diplomats said they worry that Mr. Trump’s scorn for the deal runs so deep that he would find other reasons to pull out. Last month, he warned that the accord “is under continuous review, and our participation can be canceled by me as president at any time.”Even if Mr. Trump did pledge to abide by the deal, it is far from clear that a successor deal would be endorsed by Russia or China, let alone the Iranians, who signaled in recent weeks that they are planning a new project — a fleet of nuclear-powered ships, fueled by Iranian-made reactors — that they say would justify resuming the production of nuclear fuel as the limits imposed by the deal expire over the next dozen years.Still, the mere fact that the United States and Europe are trying to work out a compromise attests to the desire, on both sides, to find a solution that would satisfy Mr. Trump while not unraveling the deal.The president’s national security team — Mr. Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, and the national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster — has on three occasions talked him out of ripping up the deal. With each deadline to reimpose sanctions on Iran, that task gets harder.There is an element of diplomatic legerdemain to the exercise, European diplomats acknowledge: How do you convince Mr. Trump that you have changed the deal without actually changing it?“The supplemental deal is a diplomatic device that is being used to allow the Europeans to declare victory,” said Mark Dubowitz, a leading critic of the Iran deal who is nevertheless open to the idea.“They can say they were able to keep the deal, remain steadfast to their commitment not to renegotiate it, but also to satisfy the U.S. and their own concerns that the length of the deal was too short,” said Mr. Dubowitz, the chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.By law, Mr. Trump must decide every 120 days whether to continue suspending longstanding American economic sanctions against Tehran, which the United States committed to lift as part of the deal. If he were to reimpose them, as he has threatened, that would effectively scuttle the deal.Iran complains that Mr. Trump’s threats have already kept European banks from investing in major projects in Iran, denying it the benefits that were promised for giving up its enrichment program.“If the same policy of confusion and uncertainties over the future of the deal continue,” Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araqchi, who was a member of the negotiating team, said last week, “if companies and banks are not working with Iran, we cannot remain in a deal that has no benefit for us.”The International Atomic Energy Agency said last week that it had received formal notice from Tehran about a “decision that has been taken to construct naval nuclear propulsion in future.”Nothing in the 2015 agreement prohibits the construction of nuclear reactors to power ships and submarines, and those reactors would almost certainly not use nuclear-weapons-grade fuel. But they could provide a pretext for Iran to resume uranium enrichment.The Europeans are most comfortable with enforcing new limits on Iran’s intercontinental ballistic missile development and testing. Missiles are not covered by the nuclear accord, but rather by a United Nations resolution, whose wording was negotiated by then-Secretary of State John Kerry just as the nuclear accord was coming together in Vienna in July 2015.The State Department’s talking points said the United States viewed the nuclear and missile programs as “inseparable,” and said that “Iran’s development and testing of missiles should be subject to severe sanctions.” The Europeans have not gone that far, at least yet.Inspections are potentially more problematic, given the administration’s rejection of arguments by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that all military-related sites are off limits to international inspectors.But this has not been an issue yet: The inspections have been limited to declared nuclear sites, and the United Nations nuclear agency affirmed last week that it had been given all the access it sought. Inspectors have said they would try to inspect military sites only if they had intelligence suggesting that surreptitious nuclear activity was underway.Once a deal is struck with the Europeans, administration officials intend to seek approval from Russia, China and Iran. But concerns that such a deal could not possibly pass muster with Iran will not deter them, a senior official said. Russia and China’s lack of participation would also matter little, given the stark consequences for Iran’s economy if Europe and the United States reimpose sanctions, this person said.While American and European negotiators are working feverishly on a deal to preserve the 2015 accord, there are also preliminary discussions about what will happen if they fall short.Reimposing sanctions, such as blacklisting the Central Bank of Iran, would cause serious problems for European companies, potentially precipitating a split in the trans-Atlantic alliance. But the president, Mr. Dubowitz noted, has the authority to phase in sanctions, which he could use as leverage to give negotiators more time to work out an agreement.He could, for example, impose sanctions on the central bank for its support of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which is accused of supporting terrorism, but waive the imposition of so-called secondary sanctions on foreign companies that do business with the bank until the next deadline in July.For the Europeans, who are mostly satisfied with the deal and face no domestic political pressure to pull out, there is little joy in this exercise. But they feel they have no choice but to go along with it. One diplomat compared it to humoring an angry relative who controlled a family vacation estate, and periodically threatened to burn it down.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/books/review/eat-the-apple-matt-young.html","EAT THE APPLE A Memoir By Matt Young 251 pp. Bloomsbury. $26.The trouble with writing the unvarnished truth in a memoir is that it requires you to be hard not only on others, but also on yourself.Matt Young’s inventive, unsparing, irreverent and consistently entertaining “Eat the Apple” is that, but it is also a useful corrective to the current idealization of the American soldier — or in this case a Marine. Patriotism and respect for the military is so high in this country that we have lately held a national debate over whether professional athletes should be required to stand for the national anthem. Men and women in uniform are given preference in boarding airplanes, and are so routinely thanked for their service that the expression has become rote. Each new season brings a crop of movies and glossy TV serials dramatizing the heroics of our Special Operations.Young sees hollowness and potential harm in this.“Enforcing the idea that every service member is a hero is dangerous,” he writes. “Like creating a generation of veterans who believe everything they did was good.” Young warns of “creating an army of fanatics.”Service deserves respect, of course, but it does not in itself guarantee stirring and selfless acts of bravery. Young is his own case in point. He sees his experience — three tours in Iraq — as far from heroic. He is at least as disturbed by his duty as he is proud of it. These contradictory feelings are a central theme in his book. Years removed, he both loathes and pines for the man he became in the Marine Corps. What he calls his “Past-me” was a reckless, selfish, cruel and dangerous man.“The infantrymen are called grunts and crunchies,” he writes. “They are stupid and intelligent and cruel and beautiful and black and white and brown and yellow and fat and lazy and lithe and godlike and frightening in their dedication to death.”It is useful for many reasons to better understand the teenagers we uniform and train and send to war. That way we can better see what happens when they are deployed. Young writes less about war here than about the culture of being a Marine, one of the few and the proud. His memoir — its title, “Eat the Apple,” refers to a vulgar Marine proverb — is in its own way a loving portrait, but it is also unsparing, ugly and outrageous. I can’t see it making the commandant’s reading list.Young and his fellow Marines are horny, deeply insecure, often drunk, compulsively (and inventively) masturbatory and disturbingly driven to kill. Away from the war zone they drink themselves sick, fight, and cheat on their wives and girlfriends. Deployed, they sometimes desecrate corpses and shoot dogs for sport. They are also willing to risk their lives and to kill with abandon for their country. All too often they come home maimed or in coffins.Few of them turn into the kind of writers capable of sorting this all out. Young is an honest, clever, darkly humorous one. He has written a collection of arresting vignettes, roughly chronological, in a variety of forms, everything from hallucinogenic prose poems like “A New Species of Yucca,” about finding a human leg absurdly protruding from “Iraqi-desert hardpan”; to a comic strip (illustrated), about a small act of revenge against the chain of command; to a darkly satirical Marine instructional manual and brutal self-indictment, “How to Ruin a Life,” in which he tells us in 15 crisply delineated steps how he, Young, hounded and humiliated an inept recruit into going AWOL, the first in a series of missteps that led to the young man’s death:“Step 14: Be completely unaffected upon hearing that during his transportation back to Camp Pendleton on Sept. 22, 2007, this person managed to slip the zip ties binding his wrists and open the sliding door of the van traveling 80 miles per hour down the 5. Remain similarly unmoved on learning he jumped. Step 15: Now live with it. Go on. Try to live with it.”His every experience in the corps, from the over-the-top hazing at boot camp to the contempt and formulaic bullying of those who fail to measure up, had trained him to accomplish this feat. To hear Young tell it, his time as a Marine, from basic training to counseling newbies, ruined him and made him, in the sense that it made him determined to become something other than what the corps wanted him to be.Young survived his combat tours physically unscathed, as do most service members. Like many Marines, he experienced more boredom, hardship and uncertainty than battle. In a hit-and-run war like Iraq, action was rare, and usually came with such suddenness and violence — an ambush, a rocket or, in Young’s case, a roadside bomb that flipped his Humvee — that those caught up in it hardly comprehended what had happened until it was over. There isn’t time for courage or even fear. The horror comes after the fact, checking for wounds, assessing the damage.The terrible things Young saw in war disturb him, the random death, the gore, the unthinking cruelty, but not so much as the person he became during those four years. He feels as guilty about the things he did to those close to him at home as he does about anything he did in Iraq. At the same time he has real affection for that crude, flawed, authentic version of himself, the “Past-me,” who he knows would disdain his introspective, self-critical present self, a teacher and a writer:“You sound like a real civvy-boy,” his Past-me tells him. “If you weren’t in any kind of firefight and you never killed anyone, what kind of nightmares do you have?”His book powerfully explains what kind. His experiences in the Marines, and in war, were not what he expected. They are not simple to process or explain. Like life itself.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/magazine/how-long-can-john-kelly-hang-on.html","On a Saturday afternoon last July, the day after John Kelly agreed to become President Trump’s chief of staff, an email arrived in his inbox. “Congratulations!” it began. “(I think!)”The sender was Philippe Reines, Hillary Clinton’s longtime aide and image buffer since her time in the Senate. Reines met Kelly while working for Clinton at the State Department, when Kelly was a senior military aide to Leon Panetta, then the defense secretary. The two stayed in touch. After Kelly left military service in 2016, he joined the advisory board at Reines’s consulting firm, Beacon Global Strategies, cashing a couple of checks before he was summoned to Trump Tower.“Can’t say I’m rooting for your boss, but I’m absolutely rooting for you,” Reines wrote to Kelly. “Especially if it takes the edges off him.” He offered some unsolicited advice: Stay off television. Tend to the mystique. Let the Kellyanne Conways and Anthony Scaramuccis talk up the president on cable. “You don’t want to be in that basket,” Reines said.Kelly replied the next day. “Thanks for taking the time,” he wrote. “I came to these same conclusions. I may be in this job for a day, or a few years, but I will stay true to my values. We are in dangerous times, Philippe, and the POTUS — any POTUS — needs all the help he can get. What I do I do for the country. That’s been my North Star for 46+ years of service and it’s worked thus far.”Seven months later, over Presidents’ Day weekend, Air Force One touched down, as it often does, in Florida, for a spell of distinctly Trumpian president-ing: Trump visited a hospital that treated victims of the Parkland school massacre before decamping to Mar-a-Lago, where a Studio 54-style disco party was waiting. The next night, he shared a meal at the club with his adult sons, Don Jr. and Eric, and Geraldo Rivera. Near, but not so near, was Kelly, dining at another table. Some guests approached Kelly to pay tribute, thanking him for keeping the president on course. “That’s what the White House needs: discipline,” Wayne Allyn Root, a Trump-loving radio host who introduced himself to Kelly that night, told me. “I won’t say he’s a celebrity. That’s probably a bad word. But he’s a person that’s respected by everybody.”For most of his 67 years, Kelly, a retired four-star Marine general who projects the weary asceticism of a TV cop perpetually two weeks from retirement, might have been out of place among Mar-a-Lago’s bronzed faces and gilded trimmings. But by mid-February, this was one of the few rooms where he could still expect such a warm reception. Back in Washington, the scandal surrounding his handling of abuse claims against a top aide, Rob Porter, hummed through its second week — an unusual longevity in a White House where news of a Trump lawyer’s pre-election hush payment to a porn star had come and gone without great consequence. More surprising still was how quickly, and unshakably, the crisis attached itself to Kelly, whose sins — praising the aide too forcefully before his departure, purportedly sitting on the allegations for months without acting — felt airlifted from an era of more traditional Washington cover-ups. Kelly held onto his job through the weekend, which did not initially seem like a given. But Trump had already been musing privately about possible replacements.Even among Trump critics, Kelly once inspired uncommon sympathy. While other high-level officials, like Jeff Sessions and Rex Tillerson, had invited doubts about how long they could possibly tolerate working in the administration, Kelly’s responsibilities seemed uniquely masochistic: He was the chief disciplinarian in a famously undisciplined White House. “You never run into somebody like Trump in the military,” Panetta told me. “They’d usually get kicked out.” The job itself was premised on a paradox: If Trump weren’t Trump, Kelly’s position would be bearable. And if Trump weren’t Trump, you would not need a John Kelly.Now, Kelly’s struggle has grown lonelier — informed, even before the Porter affair, by yawning cracks in his once-broad base of support. Some of Trump’s deepest skeptics had convinced themselves, despite a career’s worth of counterevidence, that a well-traveled military man might temper the president’s instincts, particularly on immigration. Then there were Kelly’s friends, who had already worried that the job was bending Kelly to its will, and not the other way around.Shortly after Election Day, Senator Tom Cotton, the Arkansas Republican, went to Trump Tower to see the president-elect. Trump was preparing to staff his cabinet, and he asked Cotton, an Iraq war veteran, to name the best general of this generation. Cotton chose Kelly. “The president didn’t know about General Kelly and asked me to tell him more,” Cotton told me. In December, Trump nominated Kelly to run the Department of Homeland Security.Unlike many prospective additions to the administration, Kelly had stayed out of the 2016 campaign. In an interview with Foreign Policy that July, he said he would be willing to serve in either a Trump or a Clinton administration but made plain his distaste for the “cesspool of domestic politics.” “To join in the political fray, I don’t think it convinces anyone,” he said, chiding fellow military leaders who had lined up behind candidates. “It just becomes a talking point on CNN.”His confirmation process was mostly incident-free, specked with the kind of John Wayne dialogue that had dazzled Trump from the start. Before Kelly’s Senate hearing, an aide who helped him prepare, Blain Rethmeier, noticed the general had neglected to attach a flag pin to his lapel. “Blain,” Kelly told him, declining the pin, “I am an American flag.” He was confirmed on Inauguration Day, 88 votes to 11. “A great choice,” Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, said at the time.Kelly grew up in Boston’s Brighton section, the Catholic-school-educated son of a postal worker; fellow Marines later joked that his accent required a Boston-to-English translator. In his own telling, he was shaped by two forces in the neighborhood: men who had worn the military uniform — his father, his uncles, everyone on the block — and the ubiquitous drug use among his peers. “He would claim that growing up in South Boston, he lost most of everybody he grew up with to drugs,” Adam Isacson, the director of defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America, told me, recalling meetings with Kelly when he led the United States Southern Command. “It was part of his persona.”By the time the Iraq war began, Kelly, by then a three-decade veteran of the corps, had become the first Marine promoted to brigadier general in an active combat zone in over half a century, according to the Marines. On Barack Obama’s first trip to Iraq as the presumed Democratic nominee in July 2008, Kelly rode with him in an armored truck across Anbar Province. His career advanced rapidly during Obama’s first term, and in 2012, he was named to head the Southern Command (“Southcom”), charged with overseeing United States military operations in Central and South America and the Caribbean.Under Obama, Kelly — a typically conservative Marine, friends say — was nominally tasked with steering the country toward policies he often abhorred. After officials pushed the repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell,” Kelly seethed. “Marines will die from this,” he told colleagues at the Pentagon. (The Trump White House disputes this.) He was also a fierce defender of the status quo at Guantánamo Bay, which fell under his command, publicly criticizing efforts to close the facility and chafing at media accounts that humanized those being held there. When some detainees began a hunger strike during Obama’s second term, Kelly feared that the issue was being framed too sympathetically. His charges were instructed to call the act “long-term nonreligious fasting” instead.But perhaps Kelly’s most instructive experiences at Southcom involved the scourge of trafficking — drugs, weapons, people. From command headquarters, just outside Miami, he tracked narcotics production in Colombia and Guatemala. At a forum in 2015, Kelly recalled meeting an official from Customs and Border Protection who oversaw some 200 miles of the Mexico-Texas line. “I asked her how much cocaine she got last year. She said, proud as she could be, ‘642 pounds,’ ” Kelly said. “That’s pocket litter to me. I got 191 metric tons last year.” He also charted the rise of MS-13, an international criminal gang that had become a security threat across Central America.Kelly seemed to see immigration almost entirely through the prism of security — paralleling Trump’s campaign, which nodded to the zero-sum economic view of immigration prominent on the right for years, but dwelled far more on blood-and-guts anecdotes of violent crime by immigrants. Although Southcom’s area of responsibility does not include Mexico, this did not discourage Kelly from holding forth on the country, making claims that, according to Obama-administration officials, sometimes contradicted the intelligence of Northcom, the Pentagon command covering Mexico. At the height of the Ebola scare of 2014, he suggested publicly that the disease would spark a stampede across the border, incensing White House staff members who thought he was stoking panic. “If it breaks out, it’s literally, ‘Katie, bar the door,’ ” Kelly said. “And there will be mass migration into the United States.”As he assumed control at Homeland Security, Kelly implied that his views on immigration were more nuanced than Trump’s, infused with compassion for a region whose leaders he had come to know personally. In preconfirmation testimony, Kelly accused the United States of “ignoring what our drug demand does to the people of Central and South America,” whose countries had devolved at times into “nearly failed narco-states.” He positioned himself as a moderate voice in sessions with lawmakers, casting doubt on the wisdom of a massive border wall. Speaking to a group of Democrats last year, he suggested that undocumented immigrants without a serious criminal footprint would not be enforcement priorities. “He said, ‘I’m the best thing to happen to DACA recipients,’ ” Representative Nanette Diaz Barragán, a California Democrat, told me.The benefit of the doubt lasted nine days. On Jan. 29, Trump signed an executive order barring entry to the United States by residents of seven predominantly Muslim countries, inciting large protests at airports across the country — and a backlash against Democrats who had voted to confirm Kelly, whose department was left to carry out the order. Kelly told angry lawmakers that responsibility for the chaos was “all on me.” In reality, according to an exhaustive Inspector General’s report released early this year, Kelly and his team were caught almost entirely off-guard. He told investigators that “he had assumed that White House staff had proactively engaged Congress and other stakeholders” before the order was signed, according to the report. Publicly, Kelly cheered the spirit of the measure, arguing that a federal court order blocking the ban was preventing the nation from doing “all that we can to weed out potential wrongdoers from these locations.” Privately, he faulted the execution. “That’s not going to happen again,” he told the White House.At the same time, Kelly was making good on a signature Trump campaign promise. Immigration officers arrested more than 140,000 people in 2017, a sharp uptick. “We questioned the fact that many of these arrests were taking place when parents were dropping off their children to go to school,” Representative Nydia Velázquez, a Democrat from New York who met with Kelly at the time, told me. “He didn’t back down.”By then, most Democrats had seen enough. “He’s disappointing to me,” Schumer decided by February of last year, suggesting in an interview that Kelly was probably “regretting going in.”Kelly betrayed no second thoughts in public. He also began taking on duties that appeared to be outside his jurisdiction. When news broke that Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, worked to establish a secret communications channel with Russian diplomats during the transition, it was Kelly who defended the effort on television as “a good thing.” In May, addressing a private breakfast with former diplomats and foreign-policy experts, Kelly said he had suggested to Tillerson, the ever-beleaguered secretary of state, that he could “take care of Central America” while Tillerson confronted first-order headaches like North Korea, according to a person in the room. (A White House spokesman disputes this account.)It was no secret, by then, that Trump had grown disenchanted with his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, who presided over a team consumed by squabbling factions, endless leaks and overbroad walk-in privileges for presidential face time. (During one Oval Office meeting Trump had with New York Times reporters in April, no fewer than 20 people came and went.) In an interview with The Times last December, Kelly said that he told Trump around this time that he did not believe the president “was being well served by the staff” in some respects. A month and a half later, Kelly recalled, Trump called and said, “I need you to be chief.”Kelly set out first to slay the meandering, oversize meetings he loathed. “I see these people,” he used to tell staff members at Homeland Security, after returning from the White House. “I don’t even know who they are or what they do.” Almost immediately, he sought to institute new rules: Meetings were to be tight, targeted and surprise-free. Once, Vice President Mike Pence showed up for one unexpectedly. “You guys have the meeting,” Kelly grumbled, walking off, according to a White House official who witnessed the exchange.For decades, the White House chief of staff’s mandate has been a kind of tough love — the capacity to close the door to the Oval Office and tell the president what he does not want to hear. “Above all, you are the honest broker of information,” Chris Whipple, the author of “The Gatekeepers,” a history of White House chiefs, told me. True to this template, Kelly clamped down on the free flow of information to Trump, who once rifled through Breitbart articles and conspiracy-stuffed printouts with impunity. Some executive riffraff was expelled altogether. “He fired me like a gentleman,” says Anthony Scaramucci, who lasted 11 days as communications director and scolds anyone who suggests it was 10. Those who dared attempt an unsanctioned chat with the president could expect a Kelly follow-up: “You want to be chief of staff?”The early purges, which included the exits of the advisers Stephen K. Bannon and Sebastian Gorka, restored a measure of good will toward Kelly among Democrats. But again, Kelly’s kinship with Trump on immigration was underestimated. “Part of that is the Marine in him, part of that is the Irish guy in Boston who believes that in the end, you really do have to abide by the laws,” Panetta, a friend of Kelly’s, told me. “I think that’s what’s coming out now.”In November, as Homeland Security was set to extend residency permits for tens of thousands of Hondurans living in the United States, Kelly made an 11th-hour plea to the department’s acting secretary to reconsider the move. When the administration debated lowering the annual cap on refugees — should it stay at 110,000? Fall to 50,000, the minimum recommended by Defense and State Department officials? Land somewhere in between? — Kelly offered his take: If it were his call, he said, the number would be between zero and one. The administration settled on 45,000.Even as Kelly has driven out the most flamboyant West Wing agitators — Scaramucci, Omarosa Manigault Newman, Bannon, Gorka — it has not gone unnoticed that Stephen Miller, the 32-year-old senior policy adviser and Trump’s nativist id on immigration policy since the campaign, has thrived on Kelly’s watch. “He turns out to have been more hawkish than I might have expected,” Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the hard-line Center for Immigration Studies, told me of Kelly. “It’s a pleasant surprise.”In January, several Senate moderates believed they were close to securing Trump’s support for a compromise measure protecting the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, in exchange for border-security funding and other policy adjustments. Trump invited some of them to a televised summit at the White House, where he told them he would approve any legislation they brought him. “I’m not going to say, ‘Oh, gee, I want this, or I want that,’ ” he said. “I’ll be signing it.” He even assured Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, that he welcomed a stand-alone bill protecting the Dreamers from deportation — anathema to the negotiating position of Republicans in Congress, some of whom rushed to dissuade him at the table.Kelly sat silently through the televised session. But after about an hour, when the cameras were dismissed and the meeting began in earnest, he unburdened himself in what four attendees described as a caustic scolding. “You’ve been fiddling around for years on immigration,” he told lawmakers. The time had come, he said before leaving in a huff, to “do your job.” Attendees were handed a document labeled “MUST HAVE’S,” outlining the administration’s demands: billions in border-wall funding, an end to “extended chain migration” and a move toward a “merit-based system” for legal immigration. These were requirements long pushed by Kelly and Miller and likely to sink any deal with Democrats.“What’s this?” Trump asked, according to three people present, eyeballing the list of what were ostensibly his own policy directives. He suggested the papers were unhelpful and could be disregarded. Lawmakers left the meeting unsure if the president knew his own administration’s position, or if he was even responsible for it.Days later, a bipartisan group of senators led by Dick Durbin of Illinois and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina thought again that they could sell Trump on their plans, only to be thwarted anew. This time, they did not conceal their frustrations with Kelly in particular. “I don’t think he was well served by his staff,” Graham said of the president to reporters at the Capitol. And Kelly, he said, was “part of the staff.”In another meeting with Hispanic congressional Democrats later in January, Kelly made the case once more for a “merit-based system” for legal immigration. Members reminded him what he was asking of them. “He’s saying this to 25 members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus!” Representative Luis Gutiérrez, an Illinois Democrat, told me. “My mom came with a fifth-grade education. Someone stood up and said to him, ‘So you don’t think we should even be here?’ We’re the children of those parents. And we’re members of Congress.”Kelly’s active role in immigration policy, Whipple told me, was highly unusual for a chief of staff, setting Kelly apart from even otherwise partisan warriors like Dick Cheney, who served as chief to Gerald Ford, and Rahm Emanuel, the first to hold the position under Obama. “This is abnormal,” Whipple said. “He’s been more partisan than almost any chief of staff I can think of.”It took a mass shooting and another round of Russia intrigue to elbow speculation about Kelly’s job status, post-Porter scandal, temporarily out of the news. “Trying to keep below the radar particularly after the Porter issue and my involvement was so inaccurately covered,” Kelly told me in an email, declining an interview. But his standing has not necessarily rebounded. This fate seems to flow, in part, from the heightened initial expectations of him. But it also speaks to his shortage of allies in Trump’s inner circle. Rivals, sensing a power vacuum, are wasting no time, spawning a succession of leaks and counterleaks that evoke the Priebus-era West Wing.Today Kelly holds the support of two incongruous constituencies: those who cheer him on immigration and those who assume, despite the strikes against him, that he is preventing catastrophes no one can see. But this base is shrinking. “One Donald is bad enough,” Reines, one of the last Democratic holdouts, tweeted as Kelly cycled through conflicting explanations of the Porter timeline in February. “We don’t need two.”Older friends have greeted recent events with a deeper despair. Some war buddies, eager to publicly support Kelly when he took the job, have begged off entirely. “I’d prefer not to talk anymore about him,” Mark Hertling, a retired three-star general who served with Kelly in Iraq, told me, “given what I’ve seen lately.”For John Allen, a retired four-star general who has known Kelly since the late 1970s and endorsed Clinton in 2016, the first distress signal seemed to come in October. Trump had upset the widow of La David T. Johnson, an Army sergeant who was killed in an ambush in Niger, by telling her that her husband “knew what he signed up for.” Defending himself afterward, Trump falsely accused Obama of not contacting the families of fallen troops at all, adding (truthfully) that Obama did not call Kelly when his son First Lt. Robert Kelly was killed in Afghanistan in 2010.Kelly, who had long avoided discussing his loss in detail, confirmed as much from the lectern of the White House briefing room. “It must have been enormously painful for him,” Allen told me. “John is very private in his grief.” But Kelly went on to accuse Frederica Wilson, a Florida congresswoman who knew the widow and listened to Trump’s phone call with her, of making self-aggrandizing remarks years earlier. A video from the time quickly proved him wrong, but Kelly never apologized. To friends who had winced often at Trump’s conduct, but never Kelly’s, it was agonizing to watch.In the months since, Trump and Kelly have found new reasons to grow sick of each other. Even before the Porter maelstrom began dominating Trump’s cable-news diet, the president had been smarting for weeks over Kelly’s suggestion to Fox News that the president had “evolved” on his wall demands. Both episodes stirred latent frustrations with Kelly’s imperious style, which had grated on Trump. “He’s a free spirit,” Roger Stone, Trump’s longtime informal adviser, said of the president. “Nobody handles Donald Trump. Nobody manages him. He resents those who try.” Trump has been floating Gary Cohn, his economic adviser, as a possible replacement.But on immigration, Kelly’s legacy, such as it is, may already be secure. His tumble has coincided with what was supposed to be a period of congressional progress on the issue — testing the priorities of a president who would still like a wall but thrills at the prospect of any signing ceremony. After appearing inclined at times toward an agreement with Democrats before Kelly helped reel him back, Trump has by now wholly convinced them that he is not to be trusted to cut a deal. Once held up as the administration’s most credible cross-aisle emissary, Kelly has instead become the figure — even more than Miller, from whom Democrats expected nothing less — most closely associated with White House intransigence. “He’s not a martyr, and he’s not a hostage,” Juliette Kayyem, a former assistant secretary at Homeland Security under Obama who has worked with Kelly and who initially cheered his addition to the administration, told me. “John Kelly is not saving us.”There is a favorite book of Kelly’s that he has said he rereads at key moments of his career. It is “The General,” a 1936 novel by C.S. Forester, set among British forces around World War I. Principally, it is about a commander unable to meet the moment. “He is a brave guy, a dedicated guy, a noble guy,” Kelly said of the protagonist, Herbert Curzon, in a collection of book recommendations by military leaders published last year, “but a guy who in the end has become a corps commander — a three-star general — and when presented with an overwhelming German attack couldn’t figure out how to deal with it because he’d never developed himself intellectually.”Outmatched by his circumstances, Curzon resolves, at least, to fall on his terms. “He didn’t know the great lessons of the great master, if you will,” Kelly said, “and then he just decided one day to go down to his horse, grab his sword, and attack — with the intent of dying.”

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/business/trump-trade-sanctions-aimed-at-china-could-ensnare-canada.html","WASHINGTON — China is the main target of possible tough new United States trade measures against low-priced imports of steel and aluminum. But the sanctions threaten to ensnare America’s closest allies, particularly Canada.Earlier this month, the Commerce Department declared the steel and aluminum imports  a national security threat, and President Trump must decide by mid-April whether to impose sanctions, including quotas and tariffs.But all of the options presented by the Commerce Department would affect Canada, a longtime supplier of metals to the American military and industry. Imports from Britain, Australia, South Korea and other countries could also be hit.President Trump could choose to accept one of the Commerce Department’s recommendations or fashion his own remedy. Either way, the issue highlights the difficulty the Trump administration faces as it seeks to limit imports in a world where companies routinely make, ship and sell products across borders.The potential trade action is further straining already-tense relations between the United States and Canada, two of the world’s most integrated economies. The countries have clashed over the North American Free Trade Agreement, American tariffs on Canadian lumber, and Canada’s recent complaint to the World Trade Organization about American trade practices.Last Thursday, James Mattis, the Defense Secretary, published a public letter concluding that the decline of the American industry as a result of unfair trade posed a threat to national security, a position aligned with the Commerce Department’s. But he urged the administration to proceed cautiously, particularly with regard to allies.The Defense Department “continues to be concerned about the negative impact on our key allies regarding the recommended options within the reports,” Mr. Mattis wrote. He urged the administration to consider tariffs targeted at specific countries and to focus on what he described as the underlying problem — Chinese overproduction.Yet the United States could face a challenge in crafting trade sanctions that circumvent allies and target China. It has already imposed a variety of restrictions on Chinese aluminum and steel. But American steel and aluminum producers argue that China still harms them indirectly by routing goods through third countries, as well as depressing global prices to a level where American manufacturers cannot compete.Although China has promised to cut its steel and aluminum capacity, it has made only slow, modest progress. That is why some American metal makers have argued for broader protections.Canada accounted for more than half of American imports of aluminum in 2016, followed distantly by Russia and the United Arab Emirates. Canada also made up the largest share of American steel imports in 2016 — 17 percent — followed by Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and Turkey. China did not rank among the top 10 suppliers of either metal.“From a defense perspective, it makes no sense to limit imports from Canada in the future,” said Alf Barrios, the chief executive of Rio Tinto Aluminum, which exports aluminum from Canada to the United States. “Canada is a longstanding, reliable supply for any needs the United States might have.”Canada’s inclusion in the Commerce Department recommendations was unexpected, in part because companies and workers have been relatively united in calling for the country to be exempted. The operations of many metal makers — as well as the United Steelworkers, their largest union — stretch across the border. Under law, Canada is included as part of the United States defense industrial base, and the growth of its aluminum industry dates back to supporting the United States during World War II.Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, said the recent level of animosity and trade tensions with the United States had surprised Canadians. “We see ourselves as close friends,” she said. “It’s unexpected that we would stand to be damaged by the United States, and vice versa.”Ken Neumann, the national director of United Steelworkers, struck a similar note. “There is no justification to include Canada with countries that systematically violate trade laws and engage in the dumping of illegally subsidized aluminum and steel,” he said after the release of the Commerce Department report.Canada is one of several allies that could be affected. Britain, Australia, Europe and Japan would also be included under the kind of blanket tariff or quota recently floated by the Commerce Department.The measures could fall particularly hard on South Korea, which was named as one of the countries that would face a 53 percent tariff on its steel exports, along with China, Brazil, India, Russia, Turkey and six others, under one potential scenario in the report.The United States has been seeking South Korea’s cooperation to combat a nuclear threat from North Korea. But the Trump administration has simultaneously pursued the country on trade, largely because South Korea maintains a large trade surplus with the United States. The administration is renegotiating its free trade deal with South Korea, and the country was a target of an earlier tariff on washing machines.Including countries like Canada could lead to unintended ramifications for the United States military and economy.Many products made in America use foreign metals, including the Ford F-150, a classic American truck that is consistently ranked as one of the most “made-in-America” vehicles in an industry known for sourcing parts from around the world.The truck’s engine and transmission are American-made, and the truck is assembled in plants in Dearborn, Mich., and Claycomo, Mo. Even so, the truck is made of Canadian aluminum, some of which comes from Rio Tinto’s aluminum works in Quebec — an area with plentiful hydropower, which is needed for the energy-intensive process of producing aluminum.From Quebec, some aluminum travels to a plant in upstate New York owned by Novelis, which combines it with recycled aluminum and rolls it out into wide sheets for Ford.Another 15 percent of the value of the truck’s components come from Mexico. Its window wipers come from a factory in Matamoros, some of its wheels from Chihuahua, and some of the pistons in its engine from Ramos Arizpe.The auto industry says this web of North American suppliers allows it to produce cars and trucks at a quality and a price to compete with products made around the world. Ford exports the truck back to Canada, and last year it announced that it would begin exporting vehicles to China as well.Economists say the companies that make aluminum into car bodies and soda cans employ far more people than the smelters that make raw aluminum itself. Novelis, which specializes in recycling and rolling aluminum out into sheets, announced in January that it would invest $300 million to open a new factory in Guthrie, Ky., to make the aluminum sheeting used in cars.The same trends are true in the steel industry. In mid-February, 15 American industry associations that buy steel to make their products wrote a letter to Mr. Trump arguing that, by raising the price of steel, restrictions on imports could do more harm than good. They said they represented more than one million jobs in the United States, compared with about 80,000 jobs in primary steel production.Other economic forces are driving aluminum smelting from the United States. Aluminum manufacturing is extremely energy intensive, so it has tended to go to parts of the world with cheap excess energy, like the Middle East, Iceland and Canada. Smelters in the United States must compete with other, more profitable businesses for electricity, like computer server farms.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/us/politics/peter-navarro-trade.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump could soon promote Peter Navarro, a trade policy adviser, to a more powerful position in the White House, elevating a longtime trade skeptic who has found himself sidelined by more pro-trade voices inside the White House.Mr. Navarro’s ascendance may signal that the balance of power is shifting toward those who have backed Mr. Trump’s get-tough approach to trade policy and away from those who have sought to restrain it.The president has agreed to promote Mr. Navarro to assistant to the president from his current role as deputy assistant, giving him more access to top strategy meetings, said two trade experts close to the White House, who requested anonymity to discuss plans that weren’t yet public.Natalie Strom, a spokeswoman, said the White House had no personnel announcements to make at this time. Mr. Navarro’s promotion was first reported by Inside U.S. Trade.In December 2016, before taking office, Mr. Trump created the new office of the White House National Trade Council and appointed Mr. Navarro as its director. The creation of the office suggested the new body would have a position on par with the powerful National Security Council and National Economic Council.But in April, Mr. Navarro’s National Trade Council was eliminated, and he was renamed head of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy. In September, that office was moved into the National Economic Council and placed under the purview of its director, Gary D. Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs investor whose more conventional views on trade have contrasted sharply with those of Mr. Navarro.The White House said then that reorganization was part of an effort to streamline protocols in the West Wing, but it was widely viewed as sidelining the influence of Mr. Navarro, once a primary adviser to the president. With Mr. Navarro’s promotion, the White House is again considering making his Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy independent from the National Economic Council.White House trade policy has been rocked in recent weeks by the departure of Rob Porter, a former aide accused of domestic violence, who had organized regular meetings for the trade staff. John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff who imposed order on the West Wing through a strict hierarchy that left Mr. Navarro out of high-level meetings, has also been beset by rumors that he has lost standing in the White House over a series of recent negative events.Amid the tumult, Mr. Navarro has been able to leverage a close personal relationship with the president to gain more access, a third trade expert close to the White House said.It is unclear what new responsibilities Mr. Navarro’s promotion could bring, or whether the president could change his mind. But the biggest change for Mr. Navarro is that he may once again gain more access to top meetings — and to the president himself.Mr. Navarro presided over an early period on the campaign trail and in the White House, during which President Trump appeared poised to fulfill his most aggressive promises on trade, including ripping up trade deals that he had criticized as bad for American companies and workers and imposing tariffs on imports.Mr. Navarro entered the White House with multiple trade actions written and ready for the president’s signature, including a directive to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, known as Nafta. As The New York Times has previously reported, on at least three occasions in the president’s first year in office, Mr. Navarro’s attempts to withdraw the United States from Nafta were blocked by more pro-trade advisers, headed by Mr. Cohn.The president did sign another directive authored by Mr. Navarro, pulling the United States out of a multinational trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But other efforts by Mr. Navarro to impose tariffs on steel imports and withdraw from a free-trade agreement with South Korea were blocked, leading some to question whether the president had abandoned his promise to take a more aggressive approach to trade than his predecessors.As Mr. Kelly imposed order on the White House by limiting the president’s access to some advisers, Mr. Navarro’s influence was reduced. Mr. Navarro was required to copy Mr. Cohn, his new superior, on all emails. He was absent from some high-level strategy meetings on trade, as well as the president’s trip to China, a focus of Mr. Navarro’s.Supporters and opponents of Mr. Navarro describe this as a concerted effort by more pro-trade factions to keep the president from hearing Mr. Navarro’s views, which could have goaded Mr. Trump into more aggressive action.Mr. Navarro is a Ph.D. economist and a former professor at the University of California, Irvine, but some of his ideas on trade have been criticized by mainstream economists. While most economists say Nafta has benefited the United States economy on the whole, Mr. Navarro has sharply criticized the deal. He has denounced some foreign investments as “conquest by purchase” and argued for retracting global supply chains back within the United States’ borders.From a nearby post in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Mr. Navarro spent months focusing on trade measures that were less in the spotlight, including expanding provisions that require the government to buy American goods, and carrying out a government-wide review of the defense industry.In the last few months, however, the Trump administration has ramped up its trade actions. The White House announced tariffs on washing machines and solar cells and modules in January. The administration is also on the cusp of announcing tariffs or other restrictions on imports of steel and aluminum, as well as measures to penalize China for unfair trade.In an expanded post, Mr. Navarro may be particularly influential on combating China. Mr. Navarro has authored books including “Death by China” and “The Coming China Wars,” which advocated the type of aggressive trade stance toward China that is now widely echoed by officials in the Trump administration.

"NY Times","https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/us/politics/trump-mexico-pena-nieto-visit-wall.html","WASHINGTON — President Trump’s refusal to publicly drop his demand that Mexico pay for a wall on its border with the United States has derailed tentative plans for President Enrique Peña Nieto to make his first visit to the Trump White House next month, after a contentious telephone call last week reinflamed tensions on the issue, American and Mexican officials said.The two presidents agreed to scrap the trip after what had been planned as a diplomatic phone call to lay the groundwork for a meeting devolved into a bitter quarrel over the wall, a signature campaign promise of Mr. Trump’s that has long outraged Mr. Peña Nieto, who has said Mexico has no intention of paying for it.The episode, reported earlier by The Washington Post, is the latest instance of Mr. Trump clashing sharply with the leader of a longtime ally, and of his penchant for eschewing diplomatic niceties in favor of hard-edge confrontation. It also demonstrates the degree to which the wall has come to be a major sticking point between the two neighbors, fraying decades of friendly relations and potentially blocking progress on other vital issues.In the call, Mr. Trump balked at Mr. Peña Nieto’s attempts to secure a commitment that he would concede publicly during his visit to Washington that Mexico would not pay for the border wall, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a confidential conversation.Mr. Trump grew exasperated, one official said, when Mr. Peña Nieto did not drop the matter and move on to other issues.The blowup left officials on both sides deeply disappointed that months of constructive negotiations laying the groundwork for a meeting between the presidents and rebuilding trust between the governments had been scuttled in one phone conversation. The presidents were hoping to use Mr. Peña Nieto’s visit to Washington to sign a number of bilateral treaties covering the drug fight, border issues and other matters, and to discuss trade, including the status of their efforts to renegotiate Nafta, the officials said.By Sunday, both governments were eager to put the best possible face on the squabble, insisting that a meeting was still possible and that relations had not suffered an irreparable blow.“We enjoy a great relationship with Mexico, and the two administrations have been working for a year to deepen our cooperation across a range of issues including security, immigration, trade and economics,” Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in a statement.After the call, Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, spoke with Mr. Peña Nieto, and the two agreed they should keep working on areas of agreement, another administration official said.Both sides said a possible meeting between the two presidents remained on the table, though not on the timeline or in the style that had been planned.The confrontation, according to a Mexican official, chilled the warmth and good will that had been built up between the two sides over months of negotiations, and sapped whatever level of trust had been developed after a difficult start to the relationship.It was not the first time that a disagreement over the wall spoiled the chance for the two presidents to establish a rapport.In another testy call shortly after Mr. Trump was inaugurated last year, the president pressed Mr. Peña Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for the wall, saying that would be a precondition for future talks.“If you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that,” Mr. Trump said, according to a transcript of that call obtained by The Post and posted online last summer.Mr. Peña Nieto told Mr. Trump during that call that the notion of Mexico paying for the wall was “completely unacceptable for Mexicans,” saying it would also be politically toxic for him to ever accept it. But Mr. Trump told Mr. Peña Nieto that he regarded his vow that Mexico would pay for the wall as a political imperative that he dared not relinquish.The issue derailed the first attempt by the American and Mexican governments to coordinate a meeting between the two presidents. During a January 2017 visit to Washington by Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray to arrange an announced visit, Mr. Trump took to Twitter to complain that Mexico seemed unwilling to pay for the border wall. Mr. Videgaray suspended all of his meetings and returned home. It was clear to Mexican officials then that there would be no benefit to Mr. Peña Nieto in meeting with Mr. Trump.The collapse of the new, tentatively scheduled March visit was similarly abrupt. When Mr. Videgaray returned from a visit to Washington 10 days ago, he seemed pleased with his progress. The Mexican Foreign Ministry published a picture of Mr. Videgaray at a working lunch with Mr. Kushner; Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser; and various members of the cabinet, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.Tucked into the account of the foreign minister’s trip was news that came as a surprise to Mexicans: The two sides had agreed to begin planning a meeting between Mr. Peña Nieto and Mr. Trump. The idea was met with astonishment in Mexico, where Mr. Trump is widely despised for his stream of insults against Mexican immigrants and his insistence on building a wall and sticking Mexico with the bill.A cartoon last Sunday in the newspaper Reforma asked incredulously why the trip was planned, noting that Mr. Trump had not changed any of his policies, and depicted Mr. Trump smashing a pie into Mr. Peña Nieto’s face.Before the phone conversation, the two sides had agreed — at the behest of Mr. Trump’s team — that the presidents should avoid talking about the thorny issues that had scuttled their first planned meeting, the Mexican official said, and Trump administration officials told their Mexican counterparts that they would ensure that the president would not dwell on past disagreements.But during the call, the official said, Mr. Trump lost his temper. A White House official said Mr. Trump had simply become frustrated at Mr. Peña Nieto’s insistence on staying on the subject of the wall.The Mexican government has more than the damage to Mr. Peña Nieto’s reputation to worry about. His handpicked candidate to succeed him, former Finance Minister José Antonio Meade, is running in third place in the July 1 presidential election. A botched meeting between the two presidents could ricochet and hurt Mr. Meade’s struggling campaign.The White House and the Mexican government issued separate short statements on Tuesday noting that the two presidents had spoken by phone to exchange condolences over the high school massacre in Parkland, Fla., and a helicopter crash in Oaxaca, Mexico.The Mexican statement said the governments would continue their bilateral agenda “through the coordinated efforts of their teams.” Mr. Peña Nieto’s spokesman, Eduardo Sánchez, said Saturday night that the Mexican government had nothing else to add to that statement.The White House said Mr. Trump had “underscored his commitment to expanding cooperation between the United States and Mexico on security, trade and immigration.”
                Julie Hirschfeld Davis reported from Washington, and Kirk Semple from Mexico City. Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting from Mexico City.
